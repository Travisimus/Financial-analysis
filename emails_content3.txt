Good morning. Many of you wrote in to “correct” our war movie trivia yesterday. You claimed that Forrest Gump was the highest-grossing movie that was set during the Vietnam War—not Platoon. And you know what? We will accept that answer.

As Mama said, you’ve got to put the past behind you before you can move on.

The music genre that’s said to have begun at a back-to-school party in the Bronx is celebrating its 50th birthday this weekend.

Hip-hop has grown from a style of musical expression for young people living among poverty and crime to the most popular music genre in the US and a worldwide phenomenon whose influence can be seen in everything from a house party playlist to the courtside seats at a Brooklyn Nets game.

It’s a surprising economic force

Music history experts say that hip-hop’s impact on the $16 billion music industry is so extensive that it’s not easily quantifiable. But even Run-DMC—one of the most influential hip-hop groups in history—struggled in the genre’s early days. “Nobody involved in Bronx hip-hop made big money,” Fordham University history professor Mark Naison told the Associated Press. But in 1986, Run DMC released “My Adidas,” and then an endorsement deal followed…and everything changed.

Since then, Jay-Z, Sean Combs, and Dr. Dre are a few of the dominant players in hip-hop leveraged their celebrity status to start companies, build brands, and amass millions (or in the case of Jay-Z and Combs, billions) of dollars:

Dr. Dre sold Beats Electronics to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion. It’s Apple’s largest acquisition to date.

Some of Jay-Z’s most valuable assets are Armand de Brignac, a luxury champagne line, and his entertainment agency, Roc Nation.

Diddy, up until June, had a partnership with liquor company Diageo. He also founded Bad Boy Records, which was worth $100 million at its height, according to Insider.

Puma, Nike, and Reebok have partnerships with hip-hop stars Rihanna, Travis Scott, and Cardi B, respectively.

Late fashion designer Virgil Abloh found fame with his line Off-White, which gained popularity with hip-hop icons. Luxury conglomerate LVMH acquired 60% of Off-White in 2021.

Looking ahead…industry experts predict that the genre’s economic impact will only increase in the future as brands continue to explore relationships with musicians.—CC

Disney’s streaming services are about to get pricier. The cost of ad-free versions are going up on October 12: Disney+ by 27% and Hulu by 20%, though in good news for cheapskates, the lowest-tier plans will stay the same. The House of Mouse revealed the price hikes after reporting mixed results <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awb?mblid=5ad903edc0f7&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the second quarter—including that it’s still losing subscribers (though most of those were from Disney+ Hotstar, which took a beating after losing cricket broadcast rights in India). Disney’s losses from streaming lessened last quarter, and the company is trying to make it profitable by September 2024.

Economic trouble alert from China. While most of the world is worried about inflation, China has the opposite issue: Consumer prices there fell 0.3% last month compared to 2022. Economists attribute the deflation to weak demand caused by record youth unemployment, an embattled housing market, and fewer exports. Chinese factories churned out an oversupply of products, making producer prices fall as well. That could help ease inflation in the US and Europe, but a prolonged slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy would spell trouble for global economic health. In another economic blow to China, President Biden signed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awc?mblid=02665b787811&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an order yesterday restricting US investment in certain Chinese technology.

Twitter was a major platform for Trump until he was kicked off the app in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” restored Trump’s account after he bought Twitter (now called X), but Trump has not tweeted since.

Hawaii is battling wind-swept wildfires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wildfires burn in Hawaii <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Senator Tim Richards/Facebook
Fires tearing through parts of Maui and Hawaii’s Big Island this week have killed at least six people, stranded thousands, and reduced much of a historic town to ash.

The Maui town of Lāhainā—a tourist destination and nationally recognized historical landmark—has been largely destroyed. Hundreds of families were displaced, and the US Coast Guard rescued at least 12 people who jumped into the ocean to escape the fire.

Meanwhile, Maui hospitals were inundated with injuries but not equipped for “extensive burn treatment,” according to Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, so some people have been airlifted to Oahu.

Sixty-mile-per-hour gusts partially due to a passing Category 4 hurricane fanned the blazes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awf?mblid=302bd9d0c6ef&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, blocked roads, and grounded firefighting helicopters.

Downed cell towers have also left authorities reliant on satellite phones to communicate with people in scorched areas.

Hawaii is forecast to be at an above-average risk of wildfires through November, but fires were rare in the region before humans arrived—making them especially damaging when they do hit.

So today, Virgin Galactic is sending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awk?mblid=25a9f54553af&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the first mother-daughter pair to space together on its second commercial flight.

The Galactic 02 mission, which will last about 70 minutes (just shy of a full viewing of March of the Penguins) and include a few minutes of zero gravity, is set to leave the New Mexico desert around 11am ET. And the lucky contest winner, Keisha Schahaff, is taking her daughter Anastatia Mayers as her  plus-one. They will also be the first people from the Caribbean to go to space.

Eighty-year-old Olympic canoeist Jon Goodwin will also be on the flight. He will be the first Olympian and second person with Parkinson’s disease to go to space.

Space is a vast business: For most of us, a contest is probably the most likely way to visit the stars. Tickets on a Virgin Galactic flight have reached as much as $450,000, which is pretty cheap compared to SpaceX’s $55 million and Blue Origin’s purported $28 million ticket prices.—MM

Though he’s unquestionably a star, Porter said he hasn’t made “f— you money” yet, and that both a new movie and a new television show he was set to be in were not happening because of the ongoing labor struggle. Referring to the anonymous studio exec who said the plan was to starve the strikers out, Porter made it clear that he’s plenty hungry.

Good morning. The writing gang is all in town for the Brew’s summer party this week, and after a randomized controlled trial lasting one day, we can conclude that in-person work does not boost productivity. But it does lead to a statistically significant rise in tossing around a ball and debating the various smells of NYC vs. Chicago from our desks.

HEALTH

Wegovy might do more than help people lose weight <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wegovy packages <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Picture Alliance/Getty Images
The hyped anti-obesity drug from Novo Nordisk was found to cut the risk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atg?mblid=edec8e44bb10&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of major cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attacks, by a whopping 20%, the company announced yesterday.

These findings, which came from a late-stage clinical trial, are important for two reasons:

They show that Wegovy could be more than a lifestyle drug that helps people shed pounds. It also has considerable benefits for heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the US.

And, given those wider benefits, insurance companies and Medicare could feel pressured to start covering the popular, pricey medication, which many insurers have avoided since it wasn’t deemed essential to overall health. Wegovy costs over $1,300 per month for weekly injections.

The reaction:

“If they play baseball in Denmark, Wegovy just hit a home run,” Barclays analyst Emily Field wrote <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ath?mblid=dd0e579ce6dc&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, referencing Novo Nordisk’s Danish home base. (Just checked: They don’t seem to play much baseball in Denmark.)

Others went further, declaring these findings amounted to a grand slam <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ati?mblid=9e4f738cf101&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The study means that Wegovy and a similar drug from Eli Lilly (Mounjaro) will easily become the “top-selling pharmaceuticals in history,” Barron’s gushed. And investors are betting they will be, too.

Novo Nordisk gained $60 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atj?mblid=fe8070102da1&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in market cap yesterday to close in on luxury conglomerate LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, per Bloomberg.

Eli Lilly also got a big boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atk?mblid=cd78af55792f&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from its bullish earnings report and the Novo Nordisk results. Shares of the world’s largest healthcare company soared 15% to a record high yesterday.

Big picture: A new class of superdrug that significantly reduces weight, cuts the risk of heart attacks, and offers numerous other unexplored benefits (like curbing addiction <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74-?mblid=c35b004e94ab&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>) could herald an exciting new era for public health.

But don’t count your chickens, etc., etc….Supply has been constrained amid a celebrity-powered frenzy for these drugs, there can be serious side effects, and the most recent study showing cardiovascular benefits hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.—NF

Following the news, Penn stock spiked ~13% in after-hours trading.

WeWork said it could go bankrupt. The coworking company that was valued at $47 billion just four years ago warned yesterday there was “substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” which in English means its finances are in such a deep hole it could soon file for bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atX?mblid=83a3260256d5&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Americans are spending like they’re Isla Fisher in a 2009 rom-com. A new report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/att?mblid=7f22d6f88d97&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that Americans charged more than ever to their credit cards last quarter, bringing credit card debt to over $1 trillion for the first time.

Booming credit card debt is the result of higher prices caused by inflation, rising interest rates, and strong consumer confidence, as well as 24 million new credit cards issued in the last quarter.

As debt has risen, so have late payments: The report found that in Q2, 7.2% of credit card accounts were 30 days overdue—the highest level in 11 years—and delinquency rates rose to 3.18% (up from 3%).

Yes, but…according to the Fed, neither of these numbers is shocking. Delinquency rates are returning to pre-pandemic levels after plummeting in 2020 when everyone collected stimulus checks and saved money.

Big picture: While $1 trillion in credit card debt seems alarming, economists are as unbothered as the guy holding up the line at Chipotle. Consumer debt is still just 6% of total deposits Americans have in their bank accounts, the lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atu?mblid=760832f5186b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> percentage in 20 years, per Axios.

But the digital gallery’s designer, who also created the educational Holocaust game The Light in the Darkness, tweeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atz?mblid=7d04519187f7&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that this museum—existing separately from Fortnite’s main play—will be “game changing” for Holocaust awareness: Fortnite has about 239 million active monthly users, according to ActivePlayer, and 80% of Americans have never visited a Holocaust museum, according to a 2018 study.

Fortnite players who visit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atA?mblid=f55d01a9915c&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Voices of The Forgotten Museum…

Can: Walk through exhibits resembling those found at in-person Holocaust museums, minus photos of dead bodies and concentration camps, which would violate the game’s age rating.

Cannot: Use weapons, break anything, or dance. Epic learned its lesson after players kept doing the floss and the robot at a 2021 in-game event <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atB?mblid=f1e6d0d6ad1b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.

Once the virtual museum opens (no release date yet), it could be a potent tool to deploy against a rise <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atC?mblid=4088a908872b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of white supremacy in online gaming spaces.

Key performance indicators <#> Still from Oppenheimer Universal Pictures
Stat: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has become the highest-grossing film set during World War II in history, passing Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan with a $500+ million global box-office haul, CNN reports. Of course, if you adjust for inflation, Oppenheimer is still behind the other two movies, but that’s less fun. Anyway, question for the audience: Ignoring box-office revenues…what’s the best movie set during WWII? Inglourious Basterds? Schindler’s List?

Many fellow baseball announcers voiced their support for Brown and bashed the Orioles organization, which until this PR debacle was having a stellar season (they’re in first place in the AL East). The Orioles denied that a suspension took place and said, “We look forward to hearing Kevin’s voice soon.”

This news is for anyone who has long ignored the little “Crypto” icon at the bottom of their Venmo screen. Yesterday, PayPal debuted its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), the first stablecoin to be issued by a global financial platform.

So…what is stablecoin? It’s a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, in this case the US dollar, which is meant to make it less volatile and safer than other tokens. Stablecoins have been around for decades but haven’t taken off in the consumer payment space—largely because regulators aren’t sold on that stability promise.

PayPal asserts that PYUSD will “reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments” and allow for faster and cheaper transfers between countries.

PYUSD works for peer-to-peer payments, both for checking out online or transferring value among digital wallets.

The currency is redeemable for dollars and is convertible to or from other digital currencies that PayPal supports.

And soon, you’ll be able to send your tokens between PayPal and Venmo, making it even more convenient to send Karl $50 for dinner and drinks.

The future of digital payments

Regulatory smackdowns have cast a shadow over crypto for the last year. PYUSD is issued by Paxos Trust Co., which previously issued the Binance stablecoin, BUSD, until that one was shut down by regulators earlier this year for…being involved with Binance.

But with PayPal—a mainstream fintech company—entering the scene, Paxos sees a “watershed moment” in stablecoin regulation coming. Congress is also currently sitting on two bills—one about the broader crypto industry and one that is specific to stablecoins—that could have a huge impact on what happens next.

What’s in it for PayPal? Besides keeping it at the cutting edge of payment tech, there’s a profit potential. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, could be on track to bring in $6 billion in revenue this year.—CC

That’s why their flagship robot, Flippy, is already automating frying stations for the biggest brands in fast food, including White Castle, Chipotle, Jack in the Box, and more.

An opportunity to invest in the company automating the $675b fast-food industry? That hits the spot.

Tesla’s CFO stepped down. Tesla’s chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn unexpectedly resigned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apS?mblid=f28b13750af7&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from his post after 13 years working with Elon Musk at the electric vehicle maker, which one asset manager told Bloomberg “is like working 50 years for anyone else.” Kirkhorn, who plans to stay at the company until the end of the year, to ensure a smooth transition has been replaced by the chief accounting officer. Still, the unexpected departure spooked investors, raising concerns about volatility in the company’s executive ranks and succession planning to one day replace Musk at the top.

Paramount found a new buyer for Simon & Schuster. Private equity firm KKR has agreed to buy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apJ?mblid=bfab53f7a28d&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the publisher for 1.62 billion. The deal comes less than a year after a federal judge kiboshed a plan to sell Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House for ~2.2 billion on antitrust grounds, ruling that deal would financially harm authors after a trial in which Stephen King testified against it. Rather than appeal, Paramount decided to search for a new buyer and received a $200 million fee from Random House since the deal failed to go through.

Yellow’s bankruptcy might cost taxpayers. The 99-year-old trucking company made it official on Sunday, filing for bankruptcy and ending the employment of its 30,000 workers following years of financial struggle and a labor battle with the Teamsters.

Freeway traffic won’t be the only thing grinding to a halt in Los Angeles today. More than 11,000 city workers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aps?mblid=982a23e4177f&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> plan to walk off the job this morning for 24 hours.

Sanitation and airport workers fed up with a lack of resources and unfilled vacancies will be among those participating, according to the SEIU Local 721, which represents many city workers.

This comes as Hot Strike Summer has been extra scorching in LA. The city workers will be joining:

170,000 Hollywood actors and 12,500 screenwriters picketing there and in NYC.

Thousands of local hotel workers staging rolling strikes, who even tried to get Taylor Swift to postpone LA tour dates.

Nationwide, strikes have spiked this summer, putting July among the busiest months for labor action in decades, according to the Washington Post.

There’s another big strike looming, though: With the auto workers union demanding a 40% raise for 150,000 hourly workers at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, Detroit may soon look like LA with less green juice.—AR

Turns out Classics majors and petroleum-engineering students have more in common than we thought: Their programs are shrinking. College students just aren’t interested in entering <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apy?mblid=b31f31d7b6cb&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the oil and gas industry like they used to be, no matter how much money they are set to make when they graduate, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The number of undergrads studying petroleum engineering—once a practical, popular major that would make Boomer parents proud—has seen a 75% decline since 2014, Texas Tech professor Lloyd Heinze told the WSJ.

In the past, enrollment in oil- and gas-related majors followed the market, but despite oil prices popping off between 2016 and 2021, the number grads entering the field still fell, according to the US Dept. of Education. It probably didn’t help that the pandemic highlighted how volatile the oil and gas industry could be as companies laid off over 100,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apz?mblid=1c47df17fa6d&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> employees between March and August 2020.

It’s not just about business. Post-graduation, petroleum engineers can earn 40% more than computer science grads, but Gen Z are opting for more environmentally conscious companies and roles. Current students are nervous about the fossil fuel industry’s role in climate change and if these high-paying jobs will even exist in the future as the country moves towards clean energy.—MM

Good morning. It boggles the mind of a Northeasterner who’s used to a post-Labor Day start, but apparently many kids across the US will return for the first day of school this morning.

Of course, they’ll have an earlier start to the summer than we did. So here’s a question: Would you rather be in school for most of August but out by Memorial Day? Or have August free but sit in class through June ?

SPORTS

What just happened to college football? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Oregon and Washington football players line up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tom Hauck/Getty Images
Over the past few days, college football has undergone a shake-up that further obliterated traditional geographic rivalries, left a once-proud conference on its deathbed, and cemented the formation of a handful of national superconferences—all in the pursuit of TV riches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alT?mblid=3193b1c779ba&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

The moves reflect the inevitable professionalization of college football, one of the only university athletic products that can command billions of dollars for television broadcast rights.

Here’s what went down:

Oregon and Washington defected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alU?mblid=97b1055b7978&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, joining their West Coast peers USC and UCLA in the once-Midwestern-focused conference that will soon have 18 teams from coast to coast.

Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah said they would also leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, a decision Colorado made two weeks ago.

The 108-year-old Pac-12 is teetering on the verge of collapse with just four schools remaining: Stanford, Cal, Oregon State, and Washington State.

If you hate this, blame TV

The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference (SEC) have recently secured mega TV deals that will pay their members handsomely…and the Pac-12 has not. It’s that simple.

The SEC inked a $3 billion deal for 10 years with Disney beginning in 2024, while the Big Ten reached a mammoth agreement with Fox, CBS, and NBC worth up to $7.5 billion over seven years. The Pac-12 has been trying to strike a deal with Apple TV+ to stream its games, but the potential payout for schools was not enough to stop the exodus.

The Big Ten sent $58 million to each of its schools during the 2021–22 fiscal year, according to tax records, and that number will only grow under its new TV deal.

Under the Apple deal, Pac-12 members would receive $30 million…on the high end of the range.

Big picture: “The old question—how long would it take TV money to destroy college football? Maybe we’re here. Maybe we’re here,” the head football coach at Washington State mused last Thursday. And whether or not you agree that conference realignment has “destroyed” college football, it has certainly dismantled the regional distinctiveness of each conference that gave the sport its magic.

The USWNT is going home from the World Cup.

Coming ahead of the quarterfinal round, it was the US women’s earliest exit from a World Cup ever. The next chance for some hardware isn’t far away—the Paris Olympics are next summer—but the once-dominant USWNT has found that its international peers are catching up to its quality.

Barbie is also the fastest-selling movie in the 100-year history of Warner Bros., reaching 10 figures after just 17 days in theaters. And the momentum isn’t slowing down: Barbie held its spot as the No. 1 movie in North America for the third straight weekend.

RIP fully remote work: 2020–2023. You lived a beautiful life that left an imprint on couches everywhere.

The cause of death? Videoconferencing software company Zoom has told employees within a 50-mile radius of one of its offices that they must come in <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am1?mblid=48b26b51f92d&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at least two days a week, Insider reported.

Zoom, of course, was the poster child for remote work during the pandemic, emerging from obscurity to become the go-to video platform for work meetings and awkward virtual happy hours. So, I don’t need to explain the symbolism of Zoom telling its employees to return to the physical office to describe how CEOs think fully remote work is going for them.

The increased hostility toward WFH from executives certainly hasn’t been good for Zoom stock. After soaring more than 6x during the pandemic, Zoom has lost more than $100 billion in market value since its peak, per Insider.

Google’s trying a different strategy to lure workers back

A cheap hotel stay. The tech giant is offering its employees a sweetheart deal to check in to the Google-owned hotel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am2?mblid=0f2f70059378&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on its Mountain View campus for $99 a night, CNBC reported, hoping that a breezy commute will attract more Googlers to code in person.

This “Summer Special” does not fall under approved business travel, so the hotel stays will come out of employees’ pockets. Still, workers have been doing the math…and $99/night comes out to about $3,000/month, which is less than many of them pay for rent in Silicon Valley. Plus, someone makes your bed.

Key performance indicators <#> Chart showing how much people pay for their cars per month across the US Edmunds
Stat: Last quarter, in truck-lovin’ states Texas and Wyoming, more than 25% of car shoppers committed to a payment of more than $1,000 per month <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am7?mblid=cac1b253d88b&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to Edmunds. Across the country, the share of car buyers who financed a vehicle with a monthly payment of at least $1,000 jumped to a record 17.1% in Q2 (in 2019, it was just 4.3%). Higher auto prices and borrowing rates are making buying a vehicle a major expense for households.

**Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends August 31, 2023.

We all know the barriers to investing in real estate. It’s confusing. It’s expensive. It’s one-sided. It’s only available to folks who have an extra mil laying around—right?

Wrong. Roots is dropping a remix on these tired old stereotypes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/akS?lp=text1&mbadid=6d7af96ec0ee51ff6038135139148468&mbadv=a&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Now you can invest in real estate to build your wealth for as little as $100 while lifting up the renters in the communities.

Want the deets? Invest in the Roots fund <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/akS?lp=text2&mbadid=6d7af96ec0ee51ff6038135139148468&mbadv=a&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Roots buys properties and finds top-notch renters. Those renters get invested into the fund from day one and get rewarded for paying rent on time and taking care of the property, leading to fewer vacancies, lower turn costs, and better returns.

It’s the ultimate win-win, and the fund has seen 36% growth in the last 2 years. Join over 1k investors and invest in as little as 5 minutes.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even pop some bubbly.

Scientists climb cathedrals to collect space dust. Old churches preserve more than just architectural history: Their spired roofs are an untouched oasis of asteroid and comet particles, and two scientists are going, as The Guardian put it, Ghostbusters-mode to gather samples. Equipped with harnesses and vacuum backpacks, Penny Wozniakiewicz and Matthias van Ginneken plan to scale cathedrals across the UK to gather the cosmic dust lying atop. They’re trying to understand how heavily the space objects that melt into particles en route to Earth layer our surfaces. They say cathedrals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajS?mblid=24e58d4ca294&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> are especially useful because they tend to have good construction records showing how long the roofs have been there, collecting dust.

Are you very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy? That’s the question that the General Social Survey has asked a sample of US adults since 1972. A new analysis of people’s answers shows we’re all doing…okay. There’s been a dip in happiness <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajT?mblid=79d886c45a4c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since about the turn of the century, but satisfaction has started to turn around. However, not everyone is equally happy: Married people tend to be 30% happier than unmarried folks, people who trust others (or the government) are happier than people who sleep with one eye open, and the Northeast is the unhappiest region. And women, but not men, have reported declining happiness for the past 50 years.

Size matters for keeping champagne fizzy. A 3-liter bottle of bubbly is predicted to last for 132 years before going flat—more than three times the shelf life of a 750-milliliter champagne bottle, according to a new study. A French physicist studying champagne <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajU?mblid=687012d36d13&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne analyzed the aging process of 13 vintage collections. He and his team found that after champagne’s necessary aging period, all the bottles lost carbonation the longer they sat on the shelf, but the larger the bottles were, the more fizz they retained. So, the next time you buy old champagne, the research suggests you should spring for a jeroboam.—ML

Meanwhile, social media has been abuzz as hobbyists try to synthesize the so-called “LK-99” substance at home and publish their DIY experiments online.

Why are normies suddenly obsessed with solid-state physics?

Existing superconductors are impractical for most real-world uses since they can only function at super-low temperatures or under extremely high pressure. Finding one that works in ambient-pressure, room-temp conditions is a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement that would be as game-changing as TV headphones were for your grandparents’ marriage.

Because superconductors can boost any tech that relies on electricity or magnets, a commercially viable one could enable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajW?mblid=00eb73aa34ac&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> futuristic developments like ubiquitous floating maglev trains, 100% energy-efficient grids, and commercially viable quantum computers.

That’s why everyone’s so hyped over the Seoul-based scientists’ two preliminary papers and video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajX?mblid=ed7c6199e102&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the ostensibly floating substance, LK-99. It’s already started to affect markets in Asia and the US, briefly rallying stocks of obscure companies that could benefit from a superconductor revolution. But, before the scientific community breaks into a Windows 95-launch nerd dance <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajY?mblid=4825f474d7ab&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, other experts have to review the methods and data in the paper and replicate the experiment to ensure it’s not a fluke.

The race to replicate is on

At least 12 academic labs on four continents are publicly working to synthesize the supposedly superconductive material, according to one blogger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajZ?mblid=1aeb105c158c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> who’s been tracking the progress.

US-based Lawrence Berkeley National Lab <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj-?mblid=d21626a71834&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and China’s Shenyang National Laboratory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj_?mblid=1e34449d75d3&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, as well as other labs, published tentative findings indicating that there’s a chance that the substance is indeed a superconductor.

And since the original experiment involved a mix of easy-to-procure ingredients and pretty straightforward techniques, DIYers are also getting in on the act and making LK-99 the internet’s main character.

She claims concocting the superconducting substance using her modified method cost her around $160.

* An engineer working at a California space startup, Andrew McCalip, has been spending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak2?mblid=9ddb2780b651&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a lot of time trying to cook up the floating metal and tweeting his progress.

* Levitating LK-99 became a side project for French chemistry PhD student Ezzoubair Bendadesse who (according to his unverified X account) so far has failed twice but managed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak3?mblid=7f088a60832d&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to produce a “reddish pellet.”

But most physicists are casting doubt on LK-99

Despite the internet’s enthusiasm, skepticism has been the prevailing sentiment among most experts. Material scientists are well aware that erroneous superconductor “breakthroughs” have happened before. There’s even a term for such “discoveries”: USOs (unidentified superconducting objects). 

A committee organized by the Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics said the researchers from Seoul did not provide enough evidence to conclude that the substance is really a room-temperature superconductor. They asked to review a sample of the substance.

Argonne National Laboratory theorist Michael Norman has questioned the expertise of the same researchers. He told Science Magazine that parts of their data seem “fishy” and that he’s doubtful about how exactly LK-99 can work, pointing out that superconducting is puzzlingly uncharacteristic of some of the ingredients in the metal alloy.

Looking ahead...we’ll have to wait and see whether LK-99 can be verified, but some think the fact that this saga is playing out so publicly is already a win for the scientific method. Maybe the real ambient superconductor is the lab partners we made along the way.—SK

Welcome to Residuals Tavern, where a $0.50 check will get you a beer on the house.

As its name suggests, this Studio City bar is a reference to the royalty checks known as “residuals” Hollywood performers receive when the shows or movies they worked on get optioned for reruns. In the boom years of the ’90s, residual checks could run into the hundreds of dollars. But in the streaming era, many payouts have shrunk to less than $1—a central reason why actors and writers have gone on strike.

The plastic container brand revealed back in April that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the stock still smelled fresh to day traders who sniff out the market’s leftovers. And the traders’ strategy is starting to look more airtight after shares reached a nine-month high yesterday following Tupperware’s announcement of a deal with lenders to restructure its debt and secure $21 million in new financing.

After a pandemic-era boom in sales ended, the 77-year-old enabler of we-have-food-at-home families stumbled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al8?mblid=80ee4320b57f&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and Tupperware Brands was warned in June that the NYSE might delist it because of its low value and sub-$1 stock price.

But last month, penny stock savants started snapping up the company’s shares, and BlackRock  also stepped in to catch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al9?mblid=647faa95bad9&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the falling containers as an investment partner. Tupperware’s stock has since soared to around $5—still low, but offering meteoric returns for people who bought in last month at its 61-cent low.

But Tupperware might be more than a meme stock. Some analysts say <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ala?mblid=e6f842eef522&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the container company’s rebound looks less like the internet-fueled spike in AMC and GameStop’s stocks, and more like another risky recent phenomenon: a bankrupt stock buy-up.

Notable examples include…

Transportation company Yellow Corp., which shut down operations last weekend…and then saw its stock soar by roughly 350% between Monday and Friday amid reports of a bankruptcy loan.

Hertz, the rental car company that enjoyed a 900% stock rally in the two weeks following its 2020 bankruptcy filing. It emerged from bankruptcy with a deal that paid off its debts and paid out to stockholders.

Early days: For Tupperware to mount a full comeback, it would have to confront the reason its stock (and its sales) started sliding in the first place: competitors like Pyrex and Rubbermaid.—ML

Pill for postpartum depression approved. Yesterday, the FDA signed off on the first pill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alJ?mblid=706abf2f5ccb&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for postpartum depression, a condition that affects one in eight mothers after giving birth. Sage Therapeutics and Biogen plan to start selling the pill in the US under the brand name Zurzuvae by the end of the year, after the Drug Enforcement Administration completes its review. Sage already has a postpartum depression treatment on the market, but it’s an infusion given continuously over two days, making it much less convenient for parents wrangling newborns than the new pill, which should be taken daily for two weeks.

Carl Icahn suffers on the other side of the activist equation.

A trial on the remaining claims in the high-profile case is scheduled to begin on September 12. The government hasn’t had much luck lately enforcing antitrust claims against Big Tech, but the case still poses a potential threat to Google’s core business.

Bots are usually the last thing you want to encounter on a dating app while swiping through endless photos of people standing atop mountains, but Tinder is preparing to harness the power of AI <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alf?mblid=445c83de380d&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the good of your profile.

The app, which already uses artificial intelligence in its matching algorithms, has started testing new customer-facing tools. One sifts through your photos and selects the best five to display (hopefully with the good sense to avoid the ambiguous group shot), addressing a pain point where many users get flustered in building their profile.

It’s just the beginning of the AI dating revolution. Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, which also owns Hinge and OKCupid, revealed plans in its recent earnings announcement to integrate new AI features across its brands, not just to help build profiles but also to highlight why someone may be a good match.

And the company can’t control whether daters bring AI into the mix themselves: A recent UK study found that over 50% of single men would use chatbots to help chat up potential dates.

Lo-fi alternatives: As dating apps go increasingly high-tech, some singles are turning to more staid Google Docs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alg?mblid=b91e7c64be72&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and creating long form “date-me docs” to find romance outside the app grind.—AR

TRAVEL

Airlines are dropping prices to keep you in the US <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of Earth with lots of planes crisscrossing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Travel within the US is down this summer, and airlines are slashing prices in the hopes that a $60 ticket will be cheap enough to convince you to visit Cleveland.

Earlier this week, US-focused JetBlue cut its earnings forecast for the year and warned of a loss in Q3. Other primarily domestic airlines are also experiencing turbulence:

Alaska Airlines has slashed fares, while Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier held flight promotions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahg?mblid=687a4940feaa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this summer—a sign of struggle within the industry.

US round-trip fares are down 11% compared to 2022 and 2019, according to Hopper.com.

Meanwhile…American Airlines, Delta, and United—all carriers with global operations—have exceeded expectations and kept prices high. International airfare is averaging $962, up 10% from last year and 26% from 2019, per Hopper.

Bucket list trips > sand bucket trips

Why are people traveling outside the US? It’s not exactly a mystery: Americans who were stuck in the country for nearly two years are ready to put their Duolingo streak to the ultimate test. Mastercard said that spending linked to overseas travel is currently at 154% of pre-pandemic levels.

So…where is everyone?

Predictably, a lot of Americans are in Europe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahh?mblid=bbb5d5328e0b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. According to Allianz, the number of Americans traveling to Europe this year will be 55% more than last summer, with London, Paris, Dublin, and Rome as the top destinations.

Travel to Pacific countries, including China and Japan, has also popped off. American Airlines said passenger revenue for trans-Pacific routes has more than tripled in the first half of the year.

All the international travel has left American attractions feeling a little empty inside. Major theme parks, including Disney World, Universal, Six Flags, and SeaWorld, have all reported lower-than-usual attendance rates this summer.—CC

As he’s responded to his previous two indictments, Trump pleaded not guilty. The next date to circle on your calendar for this case is August 28 for a hearing, which is just five days after the first Republican presidential debate (it’s possible Trump will not attend either). At the hearing, the judge will likely set a trial date.

But the hangover might be easing up. The company said that Bud Light’s market share has stabilized (albeit at a lower level) and hopes its new beer-and-sunshine marketing campaign will win back customers.

Start preparing for an onslaught of gas-pump pics on social media with the caption, “Thanks, Biden!” The national average of gas rose to a nine-month high of $3.82 per gallon yesterday, up 11 cents from a week ago, per AAA.

So, what’s driving prices higher? A noxious mix of heat and geopolitics.

The heat: It was so hot in July that refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, which aren’t designed for temps over 95 degrees, are struggling to produce gasoline. That, paired with increased demand for fuel over the summer (so many late-night drives blaring Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive”), means gasoline inventories in the country have fallen to their lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahq?mblid=93cdaafb1b30&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> July level since 2015.

The geopolitics: Major oil producer Saudi Arabia said yesterday it would extend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahr?mblid=a1c22288183b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its output cuts into September and could even deepen those cuts after that, according to state media. By curbing supply, Saudi Arabia hopes to prop up the price of oil—which gives it critical revenue to spend on futuristic cities and Ronaldo’s teammates. But the cuts are angering the White House because they could lead to an uptick in US inflation.

Looking ahead...the rise in gas prices may not last. Refinery operations are returning <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahs?mblid=9359c24e54aa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to normal, and demand usually tapers off in August, according to an AAA spokesperson.

Lizzo’s dance captain pushed religious beliefs on the other dancers and publicly fixated on one plaintiff’s abstinence.

Members of the dance cast, described as “full-figured women of color” in the suit, were scolded when they asked for better compensation for tour downtime.

An “excruciating” rehearsal left one plaintiff so fearful of being let go for underperforming that she soiled herself rather than take a bathroom break. She says she was later fired for recording a meeting, and that Lizzo’s security team didn’t let her leave until they searched her phone for the video.

Since the lawsuit was announced, three more women who used to work with Lizzo have said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahx?mblid=ab700f8200bd&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> they had similar experiences with the singer…but Lizzo maintains the allegations are just “sensationalized stories.”—ML

Stat: Ugh, the CEOs ordering you to return to the office just got some fresh backup from science. A new working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that data entry employees in Chennai, India, randomly assigned to work from home were 18% less productive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahB?mblid=7e11a01fe132&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> than employees who worked at the office. And that gap gets even wider (27%) when measuring the reduced productivity of workers who prefer to work from home. But maybe that’s the point. After all, recent trends <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahC?mblid=72bcc533985c&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> like “quiet quitting” and having a “lazy-girl job” show that people want to work less, at home.

By now, we’re all about as desensitized to recession talk as to the prophecies of a doomsday cult. And we may be right: Yesterday, Bank of America’s economists became the first at a major Wall Street Bank to reverse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adP?mblid=9f5551f4d0d1&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their earlier prediction, saying there won’t be a recession in the next year.

Less than a year ago, just about everyone was forecasting an imminent recession. The Bloomberg Economics probability model suggested there was a 100% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EX?mblid=6e14c297563a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> chance the US would be plunged into a recession in the next year. And back in June 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adQ?mblid=65d662588b14&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> investors to brace for an impending economic “hurricane.”

BofA pointed to solid consumer spending and inflation cooling to 3% last month. And its economists noted that, despite the Fed’s string of interest rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong with unemployment rates staying low (just 3.6% in June) and companies slowly hiring.

It’s not just BofA seeing clear skies ahead

Even as it raised interest rates again last week, the Federal Reserve said that it’s expecting a recession-free 2023. And Goldman Sachs cut the odds of recession in the next year from 25% to 20%.

CEOs in Q2 earnings calls were also feeling hopeful. The phrase “soft landing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adR?mblid=d71572ab5e1a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” the term for the Fed managing totackle inflation without tanking the economy, has been mentioned during earnings calls 97% more this cycle than in the last one.

Execs’ comments ranged from PNC CEO Bill Demchak’s “I think the soft landing feels right” to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s “I don’t know what the hell was going on.”

Even JPMorgan’s Dimon refrained from natural disaster metaphors and instead said the US consumer was currently in good shape.

Not everyone feels the same. The rosier predictions have made the timing of ratings agency Fitch’s decision to downgrade the US’ credit rating this week over political polarization awkward (Dimon called it ridiculous). But the New York Times pointed out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adS?mblid=76cc8344d88c&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that economists also made high-profile soft landing predictions right before recessions in 1990, 2000, and 2008.—MM

Tree of Life Synagogue Shooter sentenced to death. Yesterday, a federal jury concluded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aek?mblid=614f8c8bb250&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Robert Bowers, who killed 11 people at the Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath morning services, should be given the death penalty. The 2018 shooting was the deadliest antisemitic attack ever perpetrated in the US. The same jury in May convicted Bowers of 63 criminal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. A judge will formally hand down the sentence today.

Warner Brothers apologized for Barbenheimer posts. The internet is so obsessed with mashing up the two big movies of summer that it helped boost ticket sales for both Barbie and Oppenheimer, but there’s one place people are not amused: Japan. After US social media accounts for Warner Brothers’ doll movie acknowledged the memes, Japanese social media users expressed their displeasure with seeing the national tragedy of the atomic bomb as part of a joke, and the company’s Japanese arm called on its US parent to take action. In response, the US company issued an apology <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ael?mblid=a18ef3b81b09&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and deleted its posts.

Amazon has begun the largest overhaul of its grocery business since planting a flag in a Whole Foods papaya six years ago.

The revamp comes after the tech giant has struggled to work its usual industry-reinventing magic on grocery sales.

Now, under the guidance of former Whole Foods and Tesco executives, the online purveyor of every product ever is launching new strategies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adX?mblid=0c0d5f5670cd&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to beef up its in-person stores and grow its share of the $1.5 trillion US grocery market, which is dominated by Walmart and Kroger. The big changes:

Amazon Fresh delivery is now available to non-Prime members in a dozen cities, with plans to expand nationwide by year’s end.

To make Amazon Fresh stores feel more…human…the redesigned supermarkets will feature brighter colors, Krispy Kreme stands by the front door, and self-checkout lanes to supplement its E-ZPass-esque “Just Walk Out” system.

Online, the shopping carts for Amazon Fresh, Amazon.com, and Whole Foods will merge into one, eliminating the need for separate checkouts.

Yesterday, the Jamaican women’s national team danced to “One Love” to celebrate what seemed an unlikely achievement just months ago: drawing with Brazil to advance to the knockout stage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adF?mblid=3f2792ae2c22&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the World Cup.

Throw it back to April: To get the resources they needed to make it to the tournament, the self-styled Reggae Girlz were forced to throw it to the fans with crowdfunding campaigns.

In an Instagram post <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adG?mblid=29bc9f036238&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, players complained that the Jamaica Football Federation, which was struggling to find funding to send them to the World Cup, was providing “subpar planning, transportation, accommodations, training conditions,” and more. But the lack of support from the JFF led to a flood of support from elsewhere: A pair of crowdfunding campaigns has collectively raised over $100,000 for travel expenses, training, and the team’s staff.

One notable supporter is Cedella Marley—Bob Marley’s daughter—who has helped to keep the team afloat in the past after it was disbanded by JFF for…lack of funding.

It could be because the lake was built over an old burial ground—it was cheaper to fill the manmade lake on top of the roads, homes, and, yes, cemeteries in the area than to demolish them first, according to Oxford American.

Good morning. Former President Trump was indicted yesterday on federal charges over his efforts to subvert American democracy and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. It’s the third indictment brought against Trump, who now faces a total of 78 criminal counts and a $40+ million (and growing) legal bill.

Trump said he was innocent and has vowed to continue his campaign to retake the White House. On Monday, a New York Times/Siena College poll found that he was demolishing the field for the Republican nomination, leading second-place Ron DeSantis 54% to 17%.

A story about a former federal agent on a mission to save a child from sex traffickers in the Colombia jungle has made more money at the box office than Tom Cruise battling an omnipotent AI superbeing.

With an estimated budget of $14.6 million and zero A-list talent, Sound of Freedom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aao?mblid=739cfa54a0dd&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has raked in over $149 million in the US and Canada since its July Fourth premiere, putting it ahead of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and not far behind the latest Indiana Jones movie. And the two Hollywood heavy hitters had budgets of $291 million and $294.7 million, respectively. 

Why the resounding success?

An unconventional marketing strategy is fueling sales: The lead actor, Jim Caviezel, appears on screen after the movie ends and urges viewers to “pay it forward” by buying tickets for others. More than 20% of opening-day tickets were purchased in response to this method, bringing in $2.6 million. A decent critical reception <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aap?mblid=7fea97c9713b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> also helped (though some experts have criticized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaq?mblid=54f32a09f70b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the film for misrepresenting aspects of real-life human trafficking).

But, perhaps even more importantly, Sound of Freedom’s focus on children’s issues and its Christian themes have made it particularly popular among conservatives.

Former President Trump screened it for political allies at his private club in New Jersey, and GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy held a viewing event for a group of lawmakers.

It’s also reportedly been embraced by QAnon conspiracy theorists who believe that liberal elites are running a child sex trafficking ring.

The film itself has become a subject of conspiracy theories. Some viewers have claimed that theaters sabotaged screenings through nefarious tactics like withholding A/C. AMC Theaters CEO Adam Aron called allegations that the chain is suppressing viewership for Sound of Freedom “bizarre,” pointing out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aar?mblid=5fa42fff97b1&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the movie is available at 570 of its locations.—SK

The last time the US received a credit downgrade was in 2011, when S&P sent it to AA+, causing market mayhem. Past and present US economic officials said Fitch was off its rocker for the decision. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called it “bizarre and inept” given the current strength of the US economy.

The family of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells underpin much of modern medicine, reached a settlement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaz?mblid=e19444b6ba5c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday with biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Lacks’s descendants filed a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaA?mblid=c8ca21421f47&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against Thermo Fisher in 2021, claiming that the company profited off of Lacks’s cells for decades by selling her cells and seeking to obtain IP rights to medical advancements that they were used to develop.

It’s a remarkable, and painful, story. Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. While receiving treatment at Johns Hopkins, Lacks’s cells were harvested without her knowledge or consent. When researchers observed her cells in the lab, they found something surprising: They multiplied, whereas others would die within days. Scientists dubbed the line of identical cells “HeLa,” after Lacks’s name, and have used it for a variety <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaB?mblid=fea7f06a7c43&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of medical advancements you’ve likely benefited from. According to the World Health Organization, HeLa cells were used:

In developing vaccines for polio, HPV, the flu, and Covid-19.

To study different types of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as IVF.

Zoom out: The settlement terms are confidential, but Lacks’s family has used the lawsuit to call attention to racism in the American medical system, saying in their complaint, “Too often, the history of medical experimentation in the United States has been the history of medical racism.”

Bed Bath & Beyond, which filed for bankruptcy in April, came back online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaH?mblid=fac5611d3431&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday after its buyer, Overstock.com, pulled a Kirby and rebranded itself as…Bed Bath & Beyond.

The backstory: In June, Overstock picked through BB&B’s carcass and bought its name, some of its assets, and its long list of customer info for $21.5 million—but not any of its physical locations. Overstock, a former online liquidator, was hunting for a rebrand to market itself differently to customers, so it’s hoping that slapping the iconic BB&B name on its site and products will set it up for success.

But sometimes, a recognizable name is not enough. Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), a company created by sentient LinkedIn post Tai Lopez and Zoosk founder Alex Mehr, has also tried to resurrect collapsed brick-and-mortar brands. They’ve spent about $120 million since 2019 acquiring defunct retailers and attempting to bring them back to life online.

It’s gone…not well. REV has let its websites for brands like Linens ‘N Things and Modell’s fall into disrepair with sparse (if any) product listings. It even tried (and failed) to flip RadioShack into a crypto exchange in 2021. The WSJ reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaI?mblid=68f6b90e657c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in March that the group was looking into “restructuring options,” while REV acknowledged it would pause debt payments.

Overstock Bed Bath & Beyond will try to avoid the same mistakes. It’s planning to revive the customer loyalty its namesake once had and aims to release a wedding registry by next summer.—MM

Key performance indicators <#> Illustration showing Miami's population decreasing Francis Scialabba
Stat: Here are two stats that might challenge how you thought the US population was shifting.

Miami is shrinking. On net, Miami-Dade County lost nearly 80,000 people <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaM?mblid=f6e5e32fb379&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> between 2020 and 2022, per Census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution. Higher housing costs, an inconsistent job market, and perhaps overflowing septic tanks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaN?mblid=5320eced2c97&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> drove people away from a city that had hyped itself as the future of finance and crypto. Maybe Messi can turn things around.

California is gaining rich people. Millionaires love to complain about California’s high taxes, but the pull of wearing sweaters at the beach remains too strong <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaO?mblid=4b00189bb103&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The state added 116,000+ millionaire taxpayers from the end of 2019 through 2021, more than in the previous decade combined, per CA’s Department of Finance.

Quote: “Inedible.”

That’s how MrBeast described MrBeast Burger in a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaP?mblid=d7c748cb1d83&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the YouTuber filed against his partner in the venture, Virtual Dining Concepts. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, claimed the company prioritized expansion over quality control, causing “material, irreparable harm” to his brand and reputation. MrBeast Burger became a ghost-kitchen phenomenon during the pandemic, selling 1 million burgers in its first three months. But eventually, people realized that the burgers were…horrible. In the suit, Donaldson cited customer complaints that the patties were “revolting” and “disgusting.”

President Biden hopes it will give relief to the federal borrowers impacted when the Supreme Court struck down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91V?mblid=e60a8431d071&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> his more ambitious student loan forgiveness program in June.

Beginning this fall under the SAVE Plan…

One million more Americans will qualify for $0 monthly payments, the Department of Education estimates. The SAVE Plan raises the income threshold for paying nothing to $32,805, up from $22,000 or less under current income-driven repayment programs.

Unpaid interest will not pile up as long as people make their monthly payments, even if that monthly payment gets cut to $0.

And, beginning in July 2024…

Loans of $12,000 or less will be canceled after 10 years of payments (including loans taken out before 2024). Every additional $1,000 that’s borrowed beyond that would extend cancellation by another year, so a $22,000 loan would get canceled after 20 years of payments.

Undergraduate loan payments will be capped at 5% of borrowers’ discretionary funds—total income minus $32,800—down from 10% under current programs.

A net 51% of banks said they’d raised their standards for large- and medium-sized business loans last, up from 46% during Q1 and the highest since 2008 (not counting the pandemic). For consumer loans, more banks than last quarter said they had upped credit card loan standards, but not as many banks tightened auto loan standards. Banks expect standards to keep getting tighter, with most reporting they’ll continue to make them tougher across loan categories.

Homer Simpson’s expertise is wanted down South: Georgia’s Plant Vogtle has taken a brand-new reactor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7n?mblid=351eec0eee4f&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> online, the company that operates it announced yesterday.

The first built-from-scratch nuclear reactor to launch in the US in decades is supplying electricity to Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, with the capacity to power up to 500,000 homes and businesses.

The new reactor is part of a larger expansion at Vogtle, which already had two operational reactors and will add a fourth one by next spring if everything goes according to plan. But, so far, things haven’t: The new reactor went live seven years later than planned, and costs ballooned from $14 billion to nearly $35 billion.

The delays and cost overruns have led some experts to oppose new nuclear plant construction as impractical, but the public is warming up to the energy source. Recent polls show <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7o?mblid=60670cb84e41&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the highest level of support for nuclear power in a decade. It currently supplies almost 50% of US carbon-free electricity, and many experts believe it’s an important clean energy supplement to wind and solar.

What would you pay for a Birken stock? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Birkenstock sandal in display window. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> John MacDougall/Getty Images
Wearing the chunkiest, ugliest shoes has always been in fashion for some of us. But now it’s clog girl summer and Birkenstock is bracing for a possible September IPO that would value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7i?mblid=418a1f4a002e&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the company anywhere from $8 billion to $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Birks have always been lurking. The German sandal has enjoyed several waves of popularity since it first arrived in the US in the ’60s. The shoe had a moment in the ’90s and 2000s, when mega celebrities wore them. And just like other perfectly horrendous footwear (Crocs just reported a record $1 billion of revenue for the second quarter and is valued at ~$6.7 billion), Birks are back.

Birkenstock’s revenue jumped about 29% to $1.3 billion last year.

They’re not just for Dead Heads anymore: Celebs like Kendall Jenner are rocking the sandal, and Birks even made it in a couple scenes of the new Barbie movie, which helped boost recent sales, according to Bloomberg.

Two years ago, Birkenstock was acquired in a deal that valued the company at roughly $4.9 billion by L. Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that keeps Bernard Arnault constantly trading spots with Elon Musk on the list of richest people in the world. Since the acquisition, the shoe has collabed with high-end designers like Dior and Manolo Blahnik.

Looking ahead...sources told Bloomberg that the timing and size of the IPO hasn’t been nailed down yet, but the potential plans are another sign that market debuts are making their own comeback.—MM

The “Luna,” created by scientists at the University of California, Riverside, could represent major avocado innovation because it grows on a smaller tree and can be more efficiently harvested than the popular Hass variety (Luna’s great-grandmother).

OK—but how’s it taste? It’s got a different flavor than the Hass we’re used to, Luna’s co-inventor told Axios, “but it makes a wonderful bowl of guacamole.” Sold.

Do Facebook’s and Instagram’s algorithms create echo chambers that widen political divisions and erode democracy in America?

Ask 100 people and 95 might say, “Yeah, that seems logical.” The idea that social media platforms are largely responsible for political polarization has been accepted as a proven fact by elected officials, regulators, and anyone who’s been tagged in a “Denver Airport is the HQ of the Illuminati” post by their uncle. Big Tech critic Scott Galloway, an NYU professor, declared <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a48?mblid=1fcf4c990234&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2019 that Facebook “intentionally drives our society apart” by “deepening users’ beliefs & magnifying outrage.”

But landmark new research complicates that narrative <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a49?mblid=9b3274599f44&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Four studies released last Thursday found that while echo chambers do exist on social media, they don’t drive political polarization in the way Facebook’s critics have described.

Here’s why

Researchers arrived at this conclusion by tweaking the content US Facebook users saw from September to December 2020 and measuring their behaviors during and after the experiment.

In one study, the researchers swapped out an algorithmic feed for a reverse chronological feed for tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users, which meant changing the type of posts from what the company wanted users to see to a stream of posts the company did not put its thumb on.

The changes had no impact on political polarization, and even led users to see more untrustworthy content. Another side effect: The chronological feed also made people bored and, consequently, spend less time on the platform.

How the researchers summed it up: “These findings challenge popular narratives blaming social media echo chambers for the problems of contemporary American democracy.”

Looking ahead...independent experts caution against drawing broad conclusions from these studies, which examined behavior during just a few months. But more clarity could come soon since at least 12 more peer-reviewed papers on the topic are on the way.

This research is also not without controversy, because Meta (the object of inquiry) was a key collaborator by providing the data. The company and the researchers are already butting heads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4a?mblid=b2b565917f12&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> around how to interpret the findings.

The company has been teetering on the brink for years due to botched acquisitions and labor strife with the Teamsters, and not even a $700 million loan from the Trump administration during Covid could save its finances from circling the drain. Yellow employs almost 30,000 people.

A military takeover of the West African country of Niger last week has created a belt of six African countries <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4f?mblid=72df4123565b&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> coast to coast where military juntas are now in charge of the government, the NYT reported. The 3,500-mile stretch is the longest such chain on Earth.

The impacts are global: This band of military-led countries encompasses a region known as the Sahel that has leapfrogged South Asia and the Middle East as the “global epicenter of jihadist violence,” per the Times. And as a hotbed of instability and insurgency, the area has been the site of geopolitical strategery by the West and Russia for influence.

The US spent $110 million on a drone base in northern Niger for counterterrorism operations in the Sahel.

Russia, meanwhile, exerts its pull in the area through Wagner mercenaries and their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin (who is no stranger to coups). Supporters of Niger’s military takeover were seen waving Russian flags <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4g?mblid=f251bc387fd8&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and chanting Vladimir Putin’s name yesterday.

  SCIENCE

Cash is still king when treating yourself. People are more likely to reach for dollar bills than credit cards when making a guilty pleasure purchase, according to new Stanford research. In more than 118,000 real transactions at the university bookstore, buyers tended to slap their plastic on the counter for school supplies but pay with cash for “harder-to-justify” items like a stuffed plush mascot. And when asked how they’d pay for a hypothetical reiki session, participants leaned toward credit card when the treatment was described as doctor-recommended but toward cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-S?mblid=332c9fadd0e8&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when they were told it was just an impulse purchase.

You don’t have to go full vegan to help the planet. If you’re caught between the rock of loving meat and the hard place of loving the environment, good news: You can make a big impact just by eating fewer burgers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-T?mblid=4f6e8a99e3f2&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Cutting your daily meat intake from more than 3.5 ounces to less than 1.8 ounces reduces your dietary environmental impact by 30%, according to new Oxford research. Veganism remains the most sustainable choice, with about a 70% lower overall effect on factors like pollution, biodiversity, and land and water usage—but any plant-based meal helps. Plus, a separate study found that eating more fruits and veggies reduces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-U?mblid=7f36d98263c1&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the risks of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression.

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Bidenomics: What is it and is it working? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-W?mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> President Biden at an auto plant <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-W?mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Nic Antaya/Getty Images If Larry David were a macroeconomist, he’d probably tell you that the economy is doing pretty, pretty, pretty good. The real economists at Morgan Stanley have upgraded their prediction for this year’s US GDP growth by almost fourfold (to 1.9%), crediting the boost to wonkland’s new favorite buzzword: “Bidenomics.”

Biden’s critics and supporters alike have embraced the term for the president’s economic philosophy. And now that POTUS has made it central to his reelection campaign, you’re going to keep hearing it.

What does it mean? The backbone of Bidenomics is industrial policy, aka directing loads of government spending toward key industries like clean energy and semiconductor production. The goal is to make America a high-tech manufacturing hub that’s less reliant on global supply chains while creating solid middle-class jobs.

It’s intended as a rejoinder to Reaganomics, the philosophy that reducing business regulations and cutting taxes for the rich juices spending, making wealth eventually trickle down through the economy.

But in Bidenomics, it’s federal spending that drives the action.

* The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made $550 billion available for road repairs, broadband expansion, and electrical grid upgrades. 

* Chipmakers now have more reason to chipmake in the US thanks to $52.7 billion in direct subsidies in the CHIPS and Science Act.

* And companies involved in solar, wind, and clean hydrogen technologies can receive tax breaks and funding from the $500 billion Inflation Reduction Act.

The administration also doled out cash for social welfare, like temporarily expanding a tax rebate for families with children in 2021.

How’s it going so far?

The White House has quickly branded recent strong economic data as a Bidenomics win. Experts were surprised by faster-than-expected 2.4% annualized GDP growth last quarter, partially due to government spending. Yearly inflation cooled to 3% last month after peaking at 9.1% a year prior, and the labor market remains strong.

Just how much credit Biden’s industrial push deserves for all that is up for debate. But there are some concrete industry investments stemming from the new laws:

* Lured by federal subsidies, chipmakers plan to invest $210 billion in US factories and employ 44,000 people, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

* And many foreign cleantech companies are reportedly looking to invest in the US, where incentives for their industry abound. Swiss solar battery-maker Meyer Burger indefinitely postponed plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-X?mblid=aa2c066b180a&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to expand in Germany and wants to build a factory in Colorado Springs, CO, where it says it will hire 350 people.

Cheerful economic updates don’t automatically turn workers into Biden supporters though—only 36% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the economy, per <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-Y?mblid=dae847996450&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> recent polling.

Many people are still spooked by months of predictions that a recession is near and feel like inflation has eaten into wage gains, Robert D. Atkinson, economist and founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told Morning Brew.

It’s complicated…

Not all experts love the idea of the government tipping the scale in favor of some industries.

And even fans of these measures worry about the implementation. Atkins, for example, wishes Biden could have bolstered US manufacturing more broadly, focusing on aerospace and pharmaceuticals, too.

Other critics think that the strings the administration attached <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-Z?mblid=344e9e03c720&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to industry-boosting incentives, like requirements to provide certain worker benefits, distract from their main purpose of building high-tech products with a “Made in USA” sticker. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal’s Chief Economics Commentator Greg Ip worries <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-_?mblid=71106c5b9b8d&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that solid evidence on how the government can best spur activity in the private sector is sparse.

Looking ahead...it’s probably too soon to judge Bidenomics: Major government programs take time to work and can have unexpected complications and side effects—so its full impact may not be felt until well after the pundit chatter recedes.—SK

Good morning. Spent a lazy Friday afternoon scrolling through Useless Etymology <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3q?mblid=0e216dc2ec92&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and discovered a few useless word facts maybe you can actually use to impress people at your brunch or pool party today.

Useless/Useful fact No. 1: The word “shark” was first used to describe an evil or nasty person long before it was the name of the animal.

Useless/Useful fact No. 2: The word “escalate” didn’t exist until about 30 years after “escalator” (it was formed by lopping off some letters from escalator).

Let us know how these go over—maybe you’ll just be called a nerd, and that’s OK!

GOVERNMENT

Our politicians are getting older <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3s?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden talking. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3s?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jim Watson/Getty Images
The conversation about why our country's leadership looks like the inside of a Perkins at 4pm is again sweeping the nation after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell froze up and stopped talking for a full 21 seconds during a press conference in DC this week.

He and his aides say he’s fine and plans to serve the rest of his term, but the event—and other recent health scares from older politicians—add to the growing concern from other politicians and constituents over the age and mental fitness of elderly public servants. By 7pm on the day of 81-year-old McConnell’s incident, Google searches had quadrupled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3t?mblid=2f32f8be3eda&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the term “gerontocracy,” which is a government controlled by old people.

Aging has no political party

McConnell, who has had multiple health problems in the past few years, might be in the spotlight now, but he’s only the fourth-oldest senator.

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein is the oldest person in office right now, and she, too, has struggled with ongoing health problems, some that left her absent from work for an extended stretch and prompted calls for her resignation. This week, she apparently had to be corrected twice during a hearing, once because she started giving remarks during roll call.

An April Reuters poll found that 44% of registered Democrats think Joe Biden shouldn’t run for reelection because of his age—he’s 80 and the oldest president we’ve ever had.

The same poll found 34% of Republicans think 77-year-old Trump is too old to run for the highest office in the land.

Big picture: Capitol Hill is no nest of spring chickens. Members of Congress born before 1946 only account for about 6% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3u?mblid=45fb0b38eb9c&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the entire governing body, which matches their share of the overall US population. But Baby Boomers (those born 1946–1964) make up nearly 49% of Congress compared to 21% of the US population. The average age of a member of Congress is 58 years old.—MM

The Emmy's have been postponed.

Pushed to…when? Maybe January? But a source told Variety that since the Golden Globes are that same month, a date hasn’t been cemented. This is the first time the Emmys have been postponed since 2001 following 9/11.

The Fed’s favorite inflation measure fell. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key data point for JPow and Co., last month grew <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3z?mblid=d1f192c2ada3&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by only 3% from the previous June—its lowest annual rise since 2021. Meanwhile, The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the employment cost index, another favored gauge that tracks wages and benefits, also rose by its slowest rate in two years. Powell said earlier this week that central bankers will be watching the data to decide whether to raise rates yet again in September, and these are signs that things are moving in the direction the Fed wants.

The Northwestern hazing scandal keeps growing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3A?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Northwestern University students at a football game. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3A?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Michael Reaves/Getty Images
Several former Northwestern University athletes have filed lawsuits against the school for emotional, physical, and psychological harm, and many more are expected to follow.

This comes after an investigation revealed widespread hazing in the Wildcat football program, which—along with firsthand accounts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3B?mblid=0f1cb71a78ad&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> published in the university’s student newspaper—led to the firing of head coach Pat Fitzgerald earlier this month.

According to former players…

Upperclassmen singled out teammates for coerced sexual acts, usually after they made a mistake on the field.

Former coaching staff made Black players cut off their dreadlocks, taunted Latino players with “jokes” about cleaning houses, and enabled white teammates to make racist comments.

Five former Northwestern football players have filed lawsuits against the university, its president, and its current and former athletic directors. It’s not just football: A former Northwestern volleyball player is also suing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3C?mblid=83c1b6beb2ac&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> over an alleged 2021 hazing incident, and the school’s baseball coach has been fired. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing former football players, said he expects to file more than 30 lawsuits on behalf of past Northwestern athletes.

Zoom out: Experts say this is a chance for other schools to reexamine their own programs. A 2016 NCAA survey found that 74% of college athletes get hazed.—ML

REAL ESTATE

Old homes are selling for more than new ones <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3G?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Old and new homes with price tags <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3G?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
A house potentially haunted by the poltergeist of a long-deceased ex-resident will now cost you more than a brand-new place, upending the usual housing market order.

Axios found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3H?mblid=088fa066c8f2&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the median existing single-family home was going for $416,000 last month, while the median price tag for just-built ones was $600 lower.

The housing market typically prizes youth over history. Older homes have higher repair and energy costs, which lowers their attractiveness to buyers—a Victorian with ornate molding is charming only until the roof starts leaking.

Why is old now pricier than new?

It's mostly about interest rates: Since the Fed kept hiking them, the average 30-year mortgage rate now sits at 6.81%, more than double its lowest point during the pandemic. That’s making current homeowners, many of whom snagged their mortgages before prices went into the stratosphere, reluctant to sell their pad and borrow cash for a new one.

This creates a shortage of pre-owned homes on the market but no shortage of aspiring homeowners. Some developers have signaled they’re more than happy to swoop in with more affordable homes for first time buyers, as housing construction begins to recover from a precipitous decline last year.—SK

Stat: It’s official: Taylor Swift’s Era’s tour is not only propping up the economy, it’s also making the Earth move. The singer’s dancing fans at a pair of Seattle shows last weekend created seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3-magnitude earthquake <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3M?mblid=becdb7015ab3&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to measurements by seismologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach.

Good morning. This week, the countdown to the 2024 Olympics in Paris hit the one-year mark. Something to look forward to next summer? Breaking, aka break dancing, will make its debut as an Olympic sport.

But for the 2028 event in Los Angeles, the Olympics should go even bigger: the beer mile. Nothing tests an athlete’s stamina and gag reflex quite like running a mile while knocking back four beers. Earlier this month, Canada’s Corey Bellemore won the Beer Mile World Classic in Chicago with a time of 4:30.80…and he did it on one shoe.

July will be the hottest month ever <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WI?mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Graph of Daily Global Surface Air Temperature <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WI?mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Copernicus Climate Service/ERA5
How hot does it have to be for a month to be declared the hottest month on record when it’s not even over yet?

Approximately 62.51 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the global average temperature for July through the 23rd day of the month. That makes it the hottest month ever (barring a sudden ice age), according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization. Yesterday’s announcement prompted UN Secretary-General António Guterres to declare that the “era of global boiling has arrived.”

President Biden also entered the chat

Warning of the “existential threat of climate change,” the president announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WJ?mblid=ef0851d8503a&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> policies yesterday aimed at protecting workers at high risk of heat-related illness or death on the job.

Biden asked the Department of Labor to issue a heat hazard alert, which would mandate heat-related protections under federal law. Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law to eliminate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WK?mblid=f4c2930c1cd2&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> local rules mandating water breaks for construction workers, saying it creates too much red tape for business.

The president also called for increased inspections on farms and construction sites.

Other industries are also adjusting to the record heat. In the fragile airline industry, which is already juggling huge demand and worker shortages, the heat is disrupting operations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WL?mblid=63ecb3164be3&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> even further:

Warm air is less dense and requires planes to have longer runways and lighter weight to lift off, which can cause delays.

Workers on the tarmac need more frequent breaks from slinging Away suitcases.

It’s difficult to cool down a plane once it’s been disconnected from cooling units at the gate. Left idling, an aircraft’s cabin temperature can reach a dangerous level—such was the case with a Delta flight last week in Las Vegas. The airline is under investigation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WN?mblid=0f0ee20ecf7a&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for leaving passengers on the tarmac in a sweltering plane without A/C for hours.

It’s not going to get better soon. Forty percent of the US population was under a heat advisory yesterday as dangerous temps move East and roast the heavily populated I-95 corridor (hello from sweaty Brew HQ). Phoenix, AZ, can sympathize: Wednesday marked the 27th day in a row that temps reached 110 degrees.—CC

The latest figures show that not only is the US economy not spiraling into a recession due to interest rate hikes, it’s actually getting stronger as the year goes on. And for the cherry on top, underlying inflation rose at its slowest pace in two years. This could be a sign of the “soft landing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WS?mblid=d53e6be05bd7&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” Fed Chair Jerome Powell fantasized about.

Trump hit with new charges in classified documents probe.

Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination for president, denied the new allegations. But another set of criminal charges over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol could be headed his way shortly.

Tesla reportedly created a team to swat away range complaints. Last year, the automaker was so overwhelmed with complaints around its cars’ ranges that it formed a group known internally as the “Diversion Team” to cancel thousands <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WT?mblid=84469baf9e68&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of range-related customer service appointments, a Reuters investigation revealed. The reason customers had so many complaints, according to the report, was because Tesla advertised range estimates that its cars simply weren’t capable of. One recent study showed that three Tesla models had an average range 26% below what the company boasted.

That’s because finding a high-skilled job as a Chinese youth feels futile.

Highly coveted public-sector jobs are extremely competitive (one 24-year-old told CNN that 30,000 people applied for three job openings at a city government).

Plus, real estate and tech, two industries that employ a lot of recent grads, haven’t fully recovered from Covid or this year’s government crackdowns.

Few stuffed animals have been more popular among adults than children, and even fewer feel like they’re filled with beans.

The Beanie Bubble—the movie about Beanie Babies, the plush toys that people mistakenly thought would make them rich—hits Apple TV+ today, joining a growing club of new films devoted to putting wigs on A-list actors so they can play out the origin stories of iconic products.

At the toy’s peak, things got wild: The $5 pellet-stuffed plushies had astronomical appreciation estimates that prompted people to buy tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of dolls, smuggle them into the US, fight over collections of them in divorce court, and in one instance, actually commit murder.

The manufacturer, Ty Inc., enjoyed a brief period of Barbie-level sales—and sent each employee home with a holiday bonus equal to their annual salary—before the bubble burst, leaving millions of people with bins of dusty Beanies in their basements.

While it seems obvious now that Beanie Babies could only ride their wave for so long before crashing down to the depths of eBay, hindsight’s 20/20, and toy creator Ty Warner masterminded some very clever distribution tactics that made people think they had to line up outside a Hallmark store at 4am if they wanted to retire rich.

Stat: Welp—cheap gas prices were fun while they lasted. The average price for a gallon in the US rose to an eight-month high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9X2?mblid=e53244c6d76b&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday of $3.71, per AAA. While that’s far below last summer’s peak of $5.02 per gallon, gas prices have been creeping up due to refineries going offline unexpectedly and higher demand for oil at a time when supply isn’t there to meet it. Bloomberg Opinion’s oil guru, Javier Blas, notes that global oil consumption has likely reached a record high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9X3?mblid=5628cb4ac369&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Markets: The good times kept on rolling for the Dow, which notched its 11th straight day of gains yesterday for its best streak <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J3?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=669ac76e7fdf> since February 2017. But there’s a lot coming up that could impact the markets this week, from Big Tech earnings (Microsoft and Alphabet report today) to a likely rate hike from the Fed tomorrow. Barbenheimer’s success this weekend sent pink sparkly vibes to the trading floor: Mattel, IMAX, and AMC (which also got a big boost from a recent ruling blocking a planned stock conversion) were all up.

Israel passes divisive law curbing Supreme Court’s power <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J4?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Israel protesters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J4?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Amir Levy/Getty Images
Israel’s Parliament passed a controversial bill diminishing the power of its Supreme Court yesterday, further energizing massive protests against the reforms that have been rocking the country since January and threatening the stability of its economy.

The new law limits the high court’s ability to overrule decisions made by the government, such as by allowing previously disqualified officials to serve in top positions. And it’s just the first part of a polarizing effort <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J5?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc6925e56c25> by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing in Israel's history, to overhaul the court system. Further steps (which Netanyahu has postponed until November) would give the executive and legislative branches more control over appointing Supreme Court justices and reduce independent legal oversight of ministries.

It’s hard to overstate the stakes: Critics say the judicial overhaul removes checks and balances from the government, threatening Israel’s very democracy, while the governing coalition maintains it will strengthen democracy by limiting overreach by unelected justices.

Much of Israeli society is not on board: 150 large companies went on strike in protest, army reservists vowed to not show up to duty if the law passed, and demonstrators in Jerusalem showed a willingness to risk getting drenched in “skunk water” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J6?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=452aa90e3a15> by police.

A recent poll shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J7?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aae283de6365> that 68% of Israel’s startups are reacting to the anticipated judicial reform with various measures that include moving money, employees, and/or headquarters out of the country.

The Israeli shekel was the world’s worst performing currency yesterday after a volatile day of trading that showed investors’ concern about domestic politics weighing on it.

Looking ahead…Moody’s downgraded the country’s economic prospects in April, citing the “deterioration of Israel’s governance” in light of the planned judicial overhaul.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> Buoys set up by Texas to deter migrants in the Rio Grande Brandon Bell/Getty Images
The DOJ sued Texas over its Rio Grande buoy barrier. The Department Of Justice lodged the lawsuit after warning the state it would do so if the buoys set up to stop migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico were not removed (to which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott responded “Texas will see you in court, Mr. President”). The lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jb?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ee3ff9bc47f> claims Texas violated the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Biden administration asserts the unauthorized border boundary has caused both humanitarian and diplomatic troubles. The state’s actions are part of Operation Lone Star, a program that uses police resources to address migration, which Gov. Abbott says is necessary because the federal government is not enforcing immigration law.

The IRS won’t come to the door anymore. The tax agency will no longer make unannounced visits <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jc?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fbe062f14c7c> to taxpayer’s homes or businesses to collect payments due (at least in most cases). The IRS said it was halting the controversial practice, which has been around since at least the 1950s, to protect its agents’ safety. Instead, the agency will send out letters requesting that the taxpayer schedule an appointment. In specific cases, such as to deliver a summons or subpoena or seize assets, an unannounced visit may still occur, but there are only a few hundred of those each year compared to tens of thousands of the more routine visits, according to Reuters.

Adidas’s Yeezy sales are breezy. It turns out that even when sneakers get canceled, you can still move a lot of them: Adiadas has started selling off the stockpile of Yeezys it was stuck with after cutting ties with Ye over the rapper’s antisemitic remarks, and sales are strong. In its first new online sale since pulling the shoes in the fall, Adidas got orders for 4 million pairs worth €508 million (~$562 million), according to the Financial Times. And yesterday, Adidas said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jd?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a4dd87b90efb> the strong sales mean it’s now on track to lose €450 million ($498.56 million) this year rather than the previously predicted €700 million.

There’s finally research to support what stressed high-school seniors have long believed: The ultra-wealthy have a big leg up at top universities.

A Harvard-based group of economists says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jf?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fea187120bc3> children from the richest 1% of families are more than twice as likely to attend Stanford, Duke, the University of Chicago, and the Ivy League universities as students with the same SAT or ACT scores but lower family incomes, based on admissions data from 1999 to 2015.

Among these institutions…

The richest applicants had the highest nonacademic scores—which combine extracurriculars, personality traits, and recommendation letters—and especially the students from secular private schools, who were twice as likely to be accepted as public school competitors.

Children of alumni were more than twice as likely to get in as non-legacy applicants, regardless of family income. But legacy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jg?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e803f20b47ef> applicants in the top 0.1% were eight times as likely to be admitted compared to average acceptance rates for similarly performing students.

One in eight elite college attendees from the top 1% were recruited athletes, compared to just one in 20 admits from the bottom 60% of family incomes.

Last week, Neopets ushered in a new era of the very game that likely started your internet addiction.

Neopets, under new ownership and management, is embarking on a relaunch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9II?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5f202bc10bd3> and betting on nostalgia to bring users back to the land of giant omelettes and Poogle racing.

What happened to Neopets? The virtual world of magical pets peaked in 2005 with 25 million users but due to a lack of resources and aging site features (especially after the discontinuation of Adobe Flash), the platform devolved. By 2020, there were only 100,000 average daily users. It tried to save itself with trendy new features—such as NFTs and cryptocurrency—but ultimately ditched those efforts.

Now, after raising $4 million in funding this year, the company <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9IJ?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b52b9b94c72c> is embarking on a faerie quest of its own. Here’s what you and your Kougra can look forward to:

A new home screen and, as of today, 50 updated versions of old Neopets games.

World of Neopets, a mobile game and 3D simulation (presumably, something like Animal Crossing).

A re-release of the often infuriatingly glitchy Island Builders video game will arrive in early 2024.

There’s more: If the new features aren’t enough to entice you back, maybe the new Neopets brand ambassador will—it’s Emmy/Grammy/Oscar/Tony-winning artist John Legend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9IK?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=40437c2af2f9>.—CC

Answering the question “Can memes translate to ticket sales?” once and for all, Barbie and Oppenheimer gave North American movie theaters their best weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived four years ago.

Both movies dismantled expectations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EZ?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3364ab757075> and put up historic numbers.

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie pulled in $155 million, good for the best opening of the year and the best domestic opening for a woman director in history.

Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s saga about the father of the atomic bomb, grossed $80.5 million. That’s a remarkable haul for an R-rated movie (especially a historical drama that lasts three hours), and it far outpaced projections of $50 million.

While the two critically acclaimed films may have been successful on their own, their unique pairing had people thinking “Well, I want to see one, so I might as well see the other too.” About 200,000 moviegoers bought tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9E-?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4bb69034011c> to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day this weekend in North America, per the trade group the National Association of Theater Owners.

What can we learn from Barbenheimer’s success?

Both movies offered a “more than a movie” experience. For Barbie, that meant dressing up in pink with your friends and recapturing your childhood relationship with the doll. For Oppenheimer, it meant going to an IMAX screen to lose yourself in the spectacle. IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said 4am showings of Oppenheimer were sold out around the world this weekend.

Original storytelling can be a commercial hit. Barbenheimer, comprising two creatively ambitious films from outside-the-box directors, was successful at a time when studios may have squeezed all the juice they can out of tired IP. The fifth Indiana Jones disappointed, the seventh Mission: Impossible underwhelmed, and Disney plans to pull back on making Star Wars and Marvel content.

Bottom line: The movie industry will cheers to Barbenheimer till the champagne runs dry because there’s little else worth celebrating. More than 100,000 Hollywood actors and writers are on strike, sending movie production—and promotion—into a deep freeze that shows no signs of thawing.

Ditching Twitter’s classic branding is the clearest indication yet that Musk intends to create an “everything app” under a new company called X Corp. But whether its logo is a bird or an X, the social media company remains in a deep financial hole: Just last week, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management wrote down its stake in Twitter by 47%.

The issue is that the market caps of tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia have gotten so big recently that when we refer to “the Nasdaq,” we’re actually just talking about a few companies that hold outsized influence (even after the changes, Apple and Microsoft will account for 22% of the index’s weighting).

Even as sizzling US cities thrum with the sound of air conditioners, power grids in the hottest states have shown few signs of buckling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9F7?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=95b3c8adcc22>, the WSJ reported.

California utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it would be able to meet heightened demand for electricity this summer, while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is known for being not that reliable, hasn’t asked residents to conserve electricity since last month—even as power demand hit a new record last week.

It’s a “pinch me, I’m dreaming” moment for grids that were hit with dangerous blackouts during extreme weather events in the past few years. But you’re not dreaming—there are real reasons why power grids are holding up during the heat waves of summer 2023:

California’s record snowpack in the winter has given a major boost to hydropower. In May, hydropower produced more electricity than any month in the previous three years, per California’s grid operator.

In renewable energy powerhouse Texas, solar capacity is more than twice the amount installed at the same point last year.

Recently expanded battery storage in both states can be tapped as an emergency lifeline when the power grid is strained.

It’s a similar story in Europe where, despite the relentless heat, grids are doing their job <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9F8?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=69ca216e33ce>.

Looking ahead…it’s still July, and power demand could burden power systems as the calendar turns into steamy August.

Stat: Some may call it pop and some may call it soda, but one thing many US states have in common is rock-bottom unemployment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Fg?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2a9a9e36bd46>.

Despite what the internet may tell you, building a successful DTC empire doesn’t happen overnight. Once you’ve established a customer base, success can often boil down to two things: customer engagement and loyalty <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z1?lp=text1&mbadid=7148325391bbd9c45feb84fd14816824&mbadv=a&mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, two of the hardest things to earn as a new brand.

  SNAPSHOT

  Photo of the week <#> U.S. Park Ranger Eric Henson (R) pretends to be cold while posing next to the unofficial thermometer at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center indicating a temperature of 132 degrees Fahrenheit David McNew/Getty Images Park rangers at Death Valley National Park took a picture with the Instagrammable thermometer in Furnace Creek last Sunday. The joke is that typically in extremely hot weather, you wear fewer layers, but the rangers decided it would be funny to put on jackets and act cold.

Btw, this particular thermometer is known for overstating temps—it didn’t actually reach 132 degrees Fahrenheit. But a more legitimate preliminary measure did record a temperature of 120 degrees at midnight in Death Valley last week.

Scientists say the discovery of this preserved battle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CS?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=674100446483> from 125 million years ago contributes to mounting evidence that prehistoric ecosystems were complicated, with mammals sometimes turning the tables on larger reptilian neighbors. But nobody won this particular round—the mid-conflict preservation likely means the animals were too busy fighting to dodge the volcanic ash mudslide that entombed them.

It’s okay to only exercise on weekends. Squeezing in your recommended 150 minutes of moderate activity into one or two days a week is about as effective at staving off heart disease and stroke as regular exercise, according to a new study. By analyzing 90,000 people’s medical records and biometrics, researchers found that relative to couch potatoes, weekend warriors <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CT?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ed43cc121322> had a 27% lower risk of heart attack and a 21% lower risk of stroke. Meanwhile, regular exercisers saw the same risks lowered by 35% and 17% compared to the sedentary. Heart failure numbers were even more impressive: a 38% risk reduction for weekend exercisers, compared to 36% for people who hit the gym on workdays.

Schools still call mom more than dad. Now there are numbers to back up what mothers have long complained about: In straight couples, schools phone them more than fathers. Researchers emailed over 30,000 US principals and asked them to call one of two numbers, for a fictitious mom or dad, to discuss potentially enrolling their imaginary child. When principals responded, they called mom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CU?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4350871f6acc> 59% of the time. Even when researchers specified that mom was busy, she was still called 26% of the time, compared to just 10% for dads who were said to be busy.—ML

Christopher Nolan’s sprawling, star-studded thriller centers on the life of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, aka the father of the atomic bomb. The three-hour IMAX spectacle draws from a correspondingly hefty tome: the 721-page biography <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CX?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=148ef1a13cdc> American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.

To sum up (with no spoilers for anyone who’s taken a US history class): It chronicles <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CY?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6c674c8f1c56> Oppenheimer heading the Los Alamos Laboratory responsible for executing the Manhattan Project during World War II, his troubled postwar years grappling with the terrifying implications of his work, and his falling out with the government during the Cold War.

Who was Oppenheimer, really?

Oppenheimer’s internal conflicts and tumultuous circumstances make his life the perfect fodder for dramatic depiction. Despite being just one (very influential) person, he fits into a large number of roles.

The troubled genius: In his college days, Oppenheimer suffered from mental health challenges, including severe depression. He also experienced deep jealousy and acted on it, once poisoning an apple and putting it on his professor’s desk at Cambridge.

The underdog: Though he was an accomplished scientist, Oppenheimer was an unlikely choice to lead a massive lab tasked with developing cutting-edge weapons of mass destruction before Nazi Germany did. One colleague said he wouldn’t trust Oppenheimer to run a hamburger joint, Bird and Sherwin wrote in American Prometheus.

The national hero: In 1943, Brigadier General Leslie Groves took a gamble and appointed Oppenheimer as the lead scientist on the Manhattan Project, putting him in charge of a research dream team composed of brainiacs including Richard Feynman, Enrico Fermi, and Niels Bohr. Oppenheimer finally said “I guess it worked” in the summer of 1945, after witnessing the first successful detonation of a nuclear weapon in history during a test in the New Mexico desert. Atomic bombs were soon dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan’s unconditional surrender.

The conscientious campaigner: After the war, the violent destruction Oppenheimer’s invention caused in Japan weighed on him. Recalling his thoughts upon seeing the bomb successfully explode, he famously quoted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9C-?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb979426e87b> Hindu scripture: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” He also told President Truman he felt he had blood on his hands—a conversation that reportedly didn’t go well <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9C_?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7dcd62c9b50a>. He advocated for arms control and, in 1949, opposed Truman’s plan for a more powerful hydrogen bomb.

The tragic figure: Postwar America was a bad time to campaign against weapons of mass destruction as the government became obsessed with building more of them to counter the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer’s leftist sympathies and Communist Party-affiliated wife aroused suspicions of disloyalty at a time when many people were accused of being communist spies. He was stripped of his security clearance after a voluntary hearing at the US Atomic Energy Commission (it got posthumously restored in 2022).

The pariah: The entire ordeal left Oppenheimer severely depressed and feeling like his legacy was tarnished. He spent many of his remaining years in self-imposed exile, splitting his time between Princeton and the tiny US Virgin Island of St. John until he died in 1967 at age 62.

What role does Oppenheimer play today?

Understanding why Oppenheimer’s story resonates now is certainly much easier than figuring out what’s going on in Inception. The parallels to artificial intelligence, another technology that scares its own creators, aren’t exactly subtle. Nolan himself said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qQ?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3e4c18b71e2e> he believes the film is a “cautionary tale” for Silicon Valley.

Kai Bird, coauthor of the book the film is based on, wrote in an Op-Ed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D9?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=81cc52d5181c> for the New York Times that Oppenheimer’s legacy should push the government to heed the warnings of tech trailblazers urging caution, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Nolan claims he’s heard AI researchers talking of being in their own “Oppenheimer moment,” and he hopes the film could teach them a thing or two about taking responsibility for their inventions.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: The world’s biggest IMAX screens <#> General views of the TCL Chinese Theatre promoting the new Christopher Nolan film 'Oppenheimer' in IMAX on July 20, 2023 AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Watching Oppenheimer in a standard movie theater is kind of like eating “New York-style pizza” in a Dallas strip mall. It gets the job done, but it’s not the pinnacle of the experience.

For that, you’d have to travel to one of 30 IMAX theaters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D4?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8ea10732fb81> around the world equipped to project Nolan’s 70-millimeter print of the film. Nineteen of those screens are in the US, while 11 are abroad in Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Czech Republic. The one I’m trying (and failing) to get a ticket to, the AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City, measures 97 feet wide and 76 feet tall.

Nolan told the AP <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D5?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a86b37aaa126> that seeing Oppenheimer on one of these 30 screens makes for the “best possible experience” because they’re the only ones with the aspect ratios that can faithfully capture the resolution he shot the film in. An IMAX devotee since The Dark Night, Nolan used 65mm cameras for Oppenheimer that are among the highest-resolution cameras in existence. Consider: The HD screen on your home TV has 1,920 pixels of resolution per frame, while the IMAX resolution has 18,000 pixels.

But all that clarity takes up a lot of physical space, making the film stock a logistical challenge for theaters to project. The Oppenheimer film stock weighs about 600 pounds and spans more than 11 miles; at NYC’s Lincoln Square, they used a forklift to pick it up.

Which is why most people who see Oppenheimer will catch the standard digital presentation. And that, according to Nolan, will be just fine.—NF

ChatGPT seems to be getting dumber <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eg?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> ChatGPT logo with magnifying glass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eg?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The accuracy of OpenAI’s generative language model appears to have declined so much this spring that it’s giving high-school seniors wearing sunglasses in calculus a run for their money.

A not-yet-peer-reviewed study by Stanford and Berkeley researchers of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 found a huge difference <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eh?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=144ce33dc017> in the chatbot’s answers between March and June of this year—often for the worse, something people were already reporting anecdotally online.

GPT-4 went from 97.6% accuracy in identifying prime numbers a few months ago to only…2.4% in June.

The newer version of the language model got better at fending off problematic prompts, like coming up with illegal money-making schemes. But rather than explaining why queries are troublesome, it’s now more likely to simply say something like, “Sorry, but I can’t assist with that.”

When asked to create computer code, GPT-4 generated functional work 52% of the time in March and only 10% of the time in June. The lines of code it provided weren’t wrong, but they started to be accompanied by nonusable text, which could create headaches for companies trying to integrate ChatGPT into programming workflows.

The researchers say the change in ChatGPT’s behavior in such a short time is likely because OpenAI is tweaking its product. But because the company keeps its work so private, it’s hard for anyone to tell exactly what’s caused ChatGPT to start flunking. OpenAI says it’s looking into these “reported regressions.”

But more transparency may be coming soon…Yesterday, representatives from seven companies leading the AI charge—including OpenAI—convened at the White House and agreed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Ei?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ab3576e8ddf3> to guidelines that include more safety tests before product releases, a watermarking system for AI-generated content, and more disclosure of the technology’s vulnerabilities. If the companies break their promises, it could land them in hot water with the FTC.—ML

Crooner Tony Bennett has died at age 96. The legendary singer of “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” died <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EQ?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=68b9e8eb5574> yesterday following a yearslong battle with Alzheimer’s disease, during which he continued to record music and perform. Bennett’s career focused on the Great American Songbook and spanned more than seven decades. Though popular music styles changed drastically during that period, he never lost his relevance—his final performance was a concert and television special with Lady Gaga. The celebrated performer was also active in politics, especially during the Civil Rights Movement: He participated in the march from Selma to Montgomery with Martin Luther King Jr.

In an order handed down yesterday, Florida federal Judge Aileen Cannon rejected the ex-president and 2024 hopeful’s bid to postpone the trial until after the election, as well as the government’s preferred trial date in December. It’s one of several criminal investigations involving Trump, who refers to them as hoaxes. He recently signaled that he may be indicted soon in a separate probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ​​

Disney might let sports leagues buy a piece of ESPN.

Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research, the FTX-affiliated crypto trading firm the company allegedly funneled customer funds to.

Not since the Full House reboot has a city been so hopeful about a San Francisco cultural staple comeback. After Sapporo USA announced plans to shut down Anchor Brewing Company, the oldest craft brewery in the country, the brewer’s unionized employees offered to buy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9En?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=30b151ab62b5> it.

The workers sent a letter to Sapporo USA this week saying they want to purchase the legacy brewer and turn it into a co-op.

Some background: Anchor was founded in 1896 and is credited with spurring the craft beer craze in the 1970s. In 2017, it was acquired by Sapporo Breweries, a Japanese beer company, for $85 million.

Blaming “a combination of challenging economic factors and declining sales,” Sapporo USA said last week it would liquidate the 127-year-old brewery starting August 2, ending an era where people could confidently say their great-grandparents used to order the same craft brew. But workers told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eo?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a84de8d95f52> VinePair the Tokyo-based brewer had mismanaged the local staple.

The Hail Mary. While the final terms of the proposal (including price) are still being worked out, there are about 40 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 6 that hope Sapporo USA will accept their longshot bid and give them a chance to turn the business around.—MM

Even as the heat wave made it unsafe to work outside this week, Dallas-area meteorologist Pete Delkus delivered a severe burn to a colleague inside the studio. While on-air discussing the region’s extreme heat, he noticed that a heat index graphic listed McKinney, TX, as 101,105 degrees Fahrenheit—or ~10x the temperature on the surface of the sun, per Awful Announcing—and the weatherman couldn’t resist a little ad-lib <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EB?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=24913e73f580> roast of its designer.

Today marks the theatrical release of two movies that will forever be associated with each other despite having nothing in common: Greta Gerwig’s pink parade of Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s devastating biopic about the man who created a potentially world-ending bomb, Oppenheimer. And viewers have never been more amped to have whiplash.

The same-day releases from these beloved directors have created an internet memestorm of poster mashups <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AK?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=39eac3b1af76>, merch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AL?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f91b57eec64a>, and a new question to judge everyone’s tastes by: “What’s the correct order to see Barbenheimer?” We’ll take an exit poll of the 40,000+ members of the AMC Stubs program who have tickets to see both movies on the same day.

Opposites attract bigger audiences

Barbenheimer takes a page out of the well-worn Hollwyood playbook known as counterprogramming, in which studios release very different films on the same day to attract wider audiences. In the past, theaters have typically offered a film for dads to enjoy while their kids watch cartoons, or played a light rom-com in the theater next to a screen showing a psycho killer stalking teens.

Some examples:

This same July weekend 15 years ago, Christopher Nolan was a part of another famous double bill when his The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia! hit theaters on the same day. Both movies got butts in seats on opening weekend, though Heath Ledger’s legendary Joker performance brought in $158 million compared to the ABBA musical’s $27.7 million.

Sometimes, the singing hits the right notes. Both Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road opened the same weekend in May 2015, and the a cappella romp scored $69.2 million vs. $45.4 million for the apocalyptic hellscape tale.

Bottom line: Counterprogramming done right can benefit both movies, giving each more visibility than it would have gotten entering the box office solo. We’ll see if that plays out this weekend. Analysts are expecting Margot Robbie and all her dolls to bring in $90 million–$115 million. Nolan and the bomb squad are looking at ticket sales closer to $60 million. Anything at the top end of those ranges would be a relief to movie theaters that have been eerily quiet this summer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9A_?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f2ca664970bf>.—MM

Tour de headlines <#> Team co-owner Dan Snyder speaks during the announcement of the Washington Football Team's name change to the Washington Commanders at FedExField on February 02, 2022 in Landover, Maryland Rob Carr/Getty Images
The Dan Snyder era is over in DC. NFL owners approved the sale <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AR?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=617c5db5c938> of the Washington Commanders to private equity investor Josh Harris, bringing Dan Snyder’s turbulent and controversial 20+ years at the helm to a close. The team’s price of $6.05 billion is a record for an NFL franchise, but Snyder will have to give up some of his windfall right away. He was fined $60 million by the league following an investigation that found he sexually harassed a former employee and that the Commanders withheld revenue from other NFL teams.

Car thefts up, violent crimes down in US cities. Motor vehicle thefts in 32 large US cities jumped 34% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AS?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7175815d1817> in the first six months of 2023 from the same period last year and are 104% higher than early 2019 levels, per a report from the Council on Criminal Justice. The think tank attributed much of the increase to a surge in thefts of certain Kia and Hyundai models after a TikTok challenge exposed how easy it was to steal them. Meanwhile, homicides are down 9.4% across 30 large cities in the first six months of the year.

Air travel could get less frustrating. In bipartisan fashion, the House passed a bill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AT?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9f044c092b61> that aims to alleviate the worker shortage that’s been plaguing the airline industry. The legislation is broadly about reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration for the next five years, but it also includes measures that would raise the retirement age for pilots from 65 to 67 and boost the recruitment and training of other airline industry employees, especially those critical air-traffic controllers. The bill will now head to the Senate, which is debating its own version of the bill.

Russia has been attacking Ukraine’s port cities all week after pulling out of a yearlong agreement that allowed cargo ships to safely haul grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea.

Ukraine is a major global provider of wheat, corn, and oilseeds—especially to countries in Africa and the Middle East—so grain prices have risen considerably over concerns of possible shortages.

Russia exited the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative on Monday, but it wasn’t until Wednesday—when Russia said it might treat any Ukraine-bound cargo ship as hostile—that wheat prices spiked by 8.5%. That was the largest daily increase since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.

Since pulling out of the deal, Russia has targeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AV?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e657c061d988> two of Ukraine’s seaports and reportedly laid mines along the coast. Nightly missile and drone attacks have killed and wounded civilians, destroyed agricultural infrastructure, and burned enough grain to feed more than 270,000 people for a year, according to the World Food Program.

What now? Ukraine can still ship grain through the EU via road and rail, which is one reason why traders say they don’t think there will be a global grain shortage. But these routes are more expensive, and the nations that rely on Ukrainian grain might turn instead to Russia, the world’s top wheat exporter.—ML

Skims, the shapewear and intimates clothing brand founded by Kim Kardashian, reached a $4 billion valuation this week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Ao?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0030ed6a214>, according to the New York Times. Now worth more than twice Victoria’s Secret (shhh), Skims is getting ready for its call-up to the big leagues: an IPO.

Wellington Management, which led Skims’s latest funding round, famously works with companies before they launch an IPO.

The company is expecting $750 million in sales this year, and is planning on extending into men’s clothing and opening physical stores, chief executive Jens Grede told the New York Times.

After the latest funding round, Kim can finally afford that yoga membership. The new valuation (up from $3.2 billion in January) adds an estimated $500 million to her nearly $2 billion fortune, per Forbes’s calculations, which she’s amassed from her various businesses, including Skims and the skincare line Skkn.

In a wave of strike activity the US hasn’t seen since the 1970s, more than 650,000 American workers are either planning to walk off the job or have already done so this summer, according to Bloomberg. Not only are more than 100,000 Hollywood actors and writers on strike, but 340,000 UPS workers and employees at Detroit’s Big Three automakers could also hit the picket line next month.

In 2019, when Olivia was four, she was burned when a “dangerously hot” McNugget fell on her leg in the drive-thru lane at a South Florida McDonald’s, and her family sued for $15 million in damages. A jury found McDonald’s and its franchise were liable for Olivia’s injury, but thought $800k was the proper restitution for a nugget burn.

Good morning. Our inbox was a house divided yesterday. Many of you agreed with Cassandra that Apple Maps has been severely underrated for years, while hundreds of other readers claimed Google Maps was still No. 1 in their hearts and on their homescreens.

But maybe the entire debate over which navigation app is better misses the bigger picture. Maybe we should spend less time figuring out where to go next and just be happy with where we are now.

Markets: The Q2 earnings season kept investors smiling yesterday, with the Dow clinching <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wB?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aae0c007bc59> its eighth consecutive day in the green—its longest winning streak since September 2019.

Stock spotlight: Carvana’s stock shot up yesterday after it announced a deal to reduce its debt by more than $1.2 billion. In case you thought we left meme stocks in 2020 with our sourdough starters, the used car-seller jumped 43% in the first six minutes of trading for the day, per Bloomberg. Though it later lost some of those gains, it’s still up more than 1,100% for the year.

The US Team roster looks the same…and different

The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) is gunning for its third victory in a row after winning in 2015 and 2019. If they don’t get it, it’s not from lack of experience: The roster features nine players from the 2019 team and five from the 2015 team, including household names Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan.

The World Cup veterans will play alongside promising newcomers including Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman, whose names you’ll likely recognize soon.

There’s big money at stake

Sponsorships and broadcasters are spending big on women’s sports after focusing on men’s sports for, well, forever. The Women’s World Cup prize pool is still a quarter of the Men’s ($110 million compared to $440 million) but changes in the industry signal that might not be the case in the future:

For the first time, every player in the tournament is guaranteed $30,000 in prize money, and the prize pool more than tripled from 2019.

Fox Sports, which has broadcasting rights for the tournament, reported that they were nearly sold out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wE?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ce66022853b6> of all ad inventory last month.

ACL injuries are on a tear

Many top players will be absent from the field due to anterior cruciate ligament tears plaguing women’s soccer.

While women are at a higher risk of ACL injury than men, many researchers and players cite the historical lack of resources for professional women’s soccer teams as the root of the problem.

‍‍‍ Netflix got a lot more subscribers. Netflix’s decision to force you to sever that last tie to your ex by cracking down on password sharing is paying off: It gained 5.9 million subscribers last quarter. And, while other media companies struggle to navigate the transition to streaming, business is looking pretty good <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wJ?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f79333b7676a> at OG streamer Netflix, which now has extra cash on hand since the Hollywood strikes have dried up spending on content. But the company’s revenue fell short of expectations, and Netflix said in a letter to shareholders, “While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth.”

Apple built its own AI chatbot. Having finally worked out the kinks in Apple Maps, Apple engineers have been quietly toiling to make sure it doesn’t miss out on tech’s next big thing: AI.

Apple hasn’t decided how to release the tech to consumers yet, but when it does, we assume it will be similar to ChatGPT but sleeker-looking and more expensive. Apple’s stock price shot to record high on the news.

But investors were rattled by the company’s profit margin getting smaller because of those same slashed prices, especially since Elon Musk said on a call with analysts that if macroeconomic conditions are “not stable,” then prices might need to go even lower. Musk also noted that production would be down next quarter because of factory upgrades, but said it wouldn’t stop the company from meeting its delivery goals for the year.

Last week, Temu, the Chinese e-commerce app offering dirt-cheap products, filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wN?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=05b39a10f5b0> an antitrust lawsuit in a US federal court against Shein, the…other Chinese fast-fashion app that does the exact same thing, claiming Shein forced manufacturers to ditch Temu.

The court filings allege Shein bullied 8,338 separate suppliers in China into signing loyalty agreements that banned them from producing Temu products and slapped fines on anyone who dared to work with the rival company.

The retailers’ lawyers are well-acquainted

The companies are also duking it out in a different federal court after Shein accused Temu of hiring influencers to degrade the brand, and other misdeeds.

There’s a reason they’re fighting so hard:

Shein brings in $30 billion a year in sales, eclipsing other legacy fast-fashion brands like Forever 21 and H&M.

But it’s now being challenged by copycats like Temu that are starting to beat the OG at its own game: US spending on Temu was 20% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wO?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eba71392d961> higher than Shein in May.

There’s a viral trend on TikTok called NPC streaming, and it’s like if cosplay and choose-your-own-adventure books had a chronically online baby who made you feel like you were inside a broken record.

People are paying livestreamers to mimic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wU?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c265f8022a9a> the actions of NPCs, non-playable video game characters, and robotically recite nonsensical phrases of the payer’s choosing, for hours on end.

Here’s how it works:

People watching a TikToker’s livestream “tip” them with virtual coins (one TikTok coin = a little more than one real penny) which are sent to creators in the form of virtual icons that  have certain values.

Creators see the icons in real time and respond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wV?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=487e5bc6e551> by performing a corresponding action, which entices viewers to throw their cash. Some say that being able to control the streamers’ actions is sexual, but others (including some of the streamers themselves) say it’s just plain fun.

It pays: One of the most popular NPC streamers, Pinkydoll, says “ice cream so good” when she’s tipped with an ice cream cone icon—that one only costs one coin, so she says it a lot. She has amassed more than 500,000 followers and spends six hours a day on TikTok, making $2,000 to $3,000 per stream. She has even attracted a new top viewer: Timbaland <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wW?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=76e446928013>.—ML

TRAVEL

Record heat threatens to upend European tourism <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uw?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Woman in fountain amid heat wave <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uw?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
A stifling heat wave is sweeping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ux?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6939e90e441> across southern Europe just as Spain, Italy, and Greece host record crowds of international tourists finally letting loose after years of pandemic restrictions.

You won’t see it on their Instagram Stories, but your friends traipsing through Europe are probably spending their days in the shade and chugging water.

Yesterday, the high temp in Rome was 104 degrees Fahrenheit and 102 degrees in Madrid, and the Sunday forecast for Athens is 107 degrees. According to meteorologists, peak temperatures in Europe could break the Continent’s record of 119.8 degrees observed in Sicily two years ago.

Local authorities are telling folks to skip the daytime Old Town stroll and shelter inside since such heat can turn deadly.

The heat might cool travel interest

Sweltering summers aren’t just harmful to human health but also to the tourism-reliant Mediterranean economies. Euro travelers who watched their selfie sticks melt during similar heat waves last summer might be taking their next trip to a cooler climate.

There’s been a 10% annual decline in interest in Mediterranean travel among Europeans between June and November this year, according to the European Travel Commission.

This could benefit destinations further north, like Denmark and Ireland, which have seen increased travel interest.

More people might still travel to southern Europe during the cooler months, but it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to make up for the loss of summer sightseeing traffic. Italy’s Environment Ministry expects heat to bring a net loss to tourism, a setback for a country that counted on visitors for 10.2% of its GDP last year, per the World Travel & Tourism Council.

Plot twist: In the Southwest US, some visitors are being drawn to the heat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uZ?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e3dd36e8ac79>. People (some wearing fur coats!) have been flocking to Death Valley, CA, in recent days to take pictures with an Instagram-friendly thermometer showing otherworldly temperatures. On Sunday, the mercury in Furnace Creek in Death Valley hit 128 degrees, six degrees short of the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth.

A US soldier was detained in North Korea. In a bizarre situation, an American soldier willingly strolled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9tX?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f265d89d5045> into Kim Jong Un’s territory yesterday and is believed to be in North Korean detention. The soldier was being sent back to the US from South Korea for disciplinary action when he weaseled his way onto a tour of the Joint Security Area, according to CBS News. Then, according to a witness, he “suddenly gives out a loud ‘ha ha ha,’ and just runs in between some buildings.” Tensions between the US and North Korea are already high after a nuclear-armed US sub arrived in a South Korean port yesterday in what North Korea called an American provocation.

In Trump’s words on Truth Social, such a letter “almost always means an arrest and indictment.” If indicted over his role in the insurrection, it would be the third but by far the most consequential set of charges Trump has faced this year. But, despite his mounting legal woes, he remains the clear frontrunner to capture the GOP nomination for president.

While releasing tech you worked on for years might sound like a counterintuitive strategy, Meta believes open-sourcing will allow developers to discover problems with the software—ultimately leading to a better product and more influence for Meta. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, on the other hand, offer limited access to their AI tools.

Union says influencers are part of this strike, too <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uB?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> "SAG-AFTRA on Strike!" stickers all over iPhone. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uB?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
TikTok influencers will have to return to plank challenges or put down their tiny mics, because the actors strike also applies to them. On Monday, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the Hollywood union that went on strike last week, released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uC?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1436b3b1e06c> an FAQ detailing how union and nonunion creators can avoid crossing the digital picket line.

The guidelines explain that creators can fulfill any contracts that were agreed upon before the strike started and work on brand partnerships—but shouldn’t take on any new Barbie makeup tutorials. The guild also advises creators not to hype any struck work <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9u_?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c3d08f6359c>, even if they promote it as a fan.

The stakes are high: If a nonunion influencer decides to make some extra cash posting a three-hour “Easter eggs of Oppenheimer” YouTube video, they could risk never being allowed to become a member of SAG-AFTRA.

These guidelines are the first of their kind, since the last time actors walked out on major studios was in 1980 when the biggest influencer was the Morton Salt girl. But the restrictions show how the walkout is impacting the incomes of a group of performers outside of Hollywood. Influencers already play an important role in promoting films and TV shows, especially now that actors are barred from doing Hot Ones.—MM

So you won the Powerball. Now what? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ul?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Powerball lottery GIF <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ul?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Morning Brew
The Powerball will hold a drawing tonight for a jackpot worth an estimated $1 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9um?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a79301b68bf8> after no winning tickets were sold in the previous 38 drawings. If won at that amount, it’d be the third-largest Powerball prize in the lottery’s history.

Let’s get this out of the way first: You won’t win the jackpot. You just…won’t. The odds of winning are about 1-in-292 million, which means you’re far more likely to die from a meteorite strike or go to the ER because of a pogo stick injury than win the Powerball.

But let’s say you do win, because someone has to. You’ll be faced with a decision: Take a one-time lump sum of $516.8 million, or choose to be paid out in increments over 29 years in what’s called an “annuity.”

Which should you take?

Most people who win the lottery choose the lump sum, and that’s because you can make more money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9un?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=85c3672812d4> in the long run. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, you can invest your lottery winnings right away and, even with a conservative rate of return, make more over 30 years than you can with the smaller droplets of cash provided by the annuity.

That said, the lump sum may not be for everyone. Are you the type of person who bought a JPEG of a rock in 2021? If so, the annuity could offer some self-imposed fiscal discipline to prevent you from blowing all your winnings—which definitely happens. The internet is littered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uo?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=491e3f08bf4e> with stories <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9up?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b983f3b88364> of lottery winners who squandered their fortune or otherwise watched their lives fall apart after thinking they had made it.—NF

 ✢ A Note From Facet

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. The claim Pays For Itself is based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Fees range from $2-8k a year and may increase based on complexity of a member's financial picture.

Good morning. Taylor Swift’s music may be the only thing breaking more records than global temperatures. Swift became the first woman to have 12 No. 1 albums after her re-recorded Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) notched the top spot on the Billboard 200. With her twelfth No. 1 album, Swift passed Barbra Streisand, who has 11.

Seems like a good opportunity for a pop quiz: There are only three other musical acts with 12 or more No. 1 albums. Who are they? Give it some thought as you scroll through the newsletter, and the answer will be at the bottom.

People across the US are likely belting out  Lil Wayne when they check their bank balances these days. New data shows Americans have more cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qC?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5266fbdfcdee> sitting in the bank than they did before the pandemic.

Americans have ~10%–15% more in their bank accounts than they did in 2019,  according to a JPMorgan Chase analysis of 9 million Chase customers’ checking and savings accounts.

Meanwhile, after lagging behind inflation for two years, wages are finally rising faster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qD?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=64f708f19266> than prices. Last month, hourly wages were up 4%, while prices for consumer goods only climbed 3%.

We’re spending like we know we’ve got it: Though Americans have more funds than they did before they had an opinion on the best brand of hand sanitizer, median account balances have dipped more than 41% from their peak in April 2021, when people collected stimulus checks with nowhere to go spend them, the Chase analysis shows. And people still want to shop—consumer sentiment spiked to an almost two-year high this month.

It helps explain why the recession that Wall Street kept promising hasn’t materialized, according to the Washington Post (fingers crossed that trend continues).

The same can’t be said across the pond: According to the Wall Street Journal, Europeans are getting poorer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qE?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b93ea665b848>. Wages have declined, and the fallout from Covid and the war in Ukraine continue to be felt.

But there are payments coming due

The biggest bill many are facing is the one for their student loans, and those auto-debits are scheduled to restart in October after the Supreme Court struck down the Biden Administration’s plan to forgive much of that debt.

Other programs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qF?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ee79d284a32f> that helped people save during the pandemic are also winding down, and there’s no telling what the potential impact of future interest rate increases on the economy or the job market will be.

Bottom line: Things are looking up right now, but maybe don’t blow your whole rainy day fund on jet skis and Barbie merch just yet.—AR

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the decision would “strike a blow to people in need everywhere.” In other Russia news: Russia seized local assets of European companies Danone and Carlsberg, underscoring the risks for foreign companies staying in business there. And a Ukrainian attack damaged a bridge connecting Russia with the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Who has two electric motors and a $10,000 price cut? *Slaps roof of F-150 Lightning* this guy. Yesterday, Ford reduced the starting cost of its battery-powered pickup truck from $59,995 to $49,995, saying it was because of lower material prices and greater production capabilities.

It’s likely also because over the weekend, Tesla began building its long-awaited Cybertruck, which will directly rival <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qK?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e20e4c0625f8> the F-150 Lightning and is estimated by Kelley Blue Book to start at around $50,000. While Ford has slashed the price tag on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV several times to try and compete with Tesla, whose own cuts have helped it dominate 60% of the fluctuating American EV market, it had been raising prices on the F-150 Lightning…until now.

With sales of the F-150 Lightning dropping from 13,000 in the second half of 2022 to 8,800 in the first half of 2023, Ford is hoping the price cut will juice sales. But there’s still an oversupply of the reduced cost Mach-E that far outpaces demand.

Ford isn’t alone: The quantity of EVs available for purchase in the US has exploded by almost 350% this year, according to Cox Automotive, and demand hasn’t kept pace—leaving many unsold cars on lots.—ML

One of the internet’s favorite travel hacks made headlines recently after a teen allegedly got detained <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qu?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8a62392d721f> and barred from boarding an American Airlines flight because his North Carolina driver’s license aroused suspicion.

The passenger wasn’t suspected of smuggling Cook Out: His trip to NYC had a layover in Charlotte, NC, and airline staff (correctly) supposed he was committing a textbook example of skiplagging, the thrifty trick of booking a flight with a stopover with no intention of proceeding to the final destination.

Why skip out on the final city? Airlines usually charge more for direct flights than ones with layovers, so booking this way can save you a lot on the fare.

But missing out on the extra cash makes carriers side eye the practice like you would a seatmate keen on unpacking the trauma of his three divorces with you.

That means it’s not just the LeBrons of the world who are out there being both literally and figuratively baller: The WSJ highlighted the deal recently offered by the Pacers worth up to $45 million to Bruce Brown, a player who started last season on the bench before quietly helping his Denver Nuggets teammates clinch the championship.

The Dutch entrepreneur who is contracted to manage Mali’s domain has been sounding the alarm about this leak potential for a decade, but his contract is almost up, meaning all emails will soon go straight to Mali’s government, which is closely allied with Russia.

The DeSantis campaign is burning through cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mP?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mP?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Joe Raedle/Getty Images
This weekend, we got the first detailed look <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mQ?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=884f473a07e0> at the finances of 2024 presidential candidates, and here’s the biggest takeaway: Ron DeSantis is burning through money like he’s Adam Neumann in 2017. Regulatory filings show that DeSantis’s finances desperately need replenishment if he wants to make up ground against former President Trump, who he’s trailing far behind in the polls for the Republican nomination.

The numbers: The Florida governor raised an impressive $20 million in the second quarter but has spent about 40% of the amount he raised.

One of the biggest reasons for the cash burn is that the DeSantis campaign hired like a tech company that thought Covid would last forever. The DeSantis team had 92 full-time employees on payroll (by far the biggest staff of any GOP candidate) before reportedly firing about a dozen last week to reduce expenses.

And generating revenue will also be a challenge for DeSantis because many of his donors are tapped out: More than two-thirds of his cash on hand is from backers who gave $3,300, which is the biggest check individuals can write in primary elections.

How do the other contenders stack up?

While Trump, the front-runner, raised less than DeSantis last quarter ($17.7 million), he’s still got twice as much to spend.

President Biden’s operation looks downright bootstrapped. His reelection campaign spent just $1.1 million in the second quarter and employs just four full-time staff. At this point in Obama’s reelection campaign in 2011, he had spent $11 million, per CNN. This lack of spending, plus a meager haul <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mR?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cb4eebffb873> from smaller donors, is raising some concern in Democrat circles.

Lesser-known candidates are getting creative

When you’re a newcomer to national politics and don’t have a sprawling campaign machine, you’ve got to get scrappy to raise money.

Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, is handing out commissions to turn his supporters into salespeople. A program he launched last week will give his backers a 10% cut <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mS?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ba3870dee2f6> of the money they raise for his campaign.

Another GOP candidate, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, is leveraging his city’s newest asset: He’s raffling off front-row tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mT?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=701a6d7d4115> to Lionel Messi’s first game at Inter Miami to his financial supporters.

Finally, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is simply handing out cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mU?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3ed78cf694a7> ($20 in gift cards, to be precise) to anyone who donates as little as $1 to his campaign. Burgum needs to hit a 40,000-donor target to qualify for the first GOP debate next month, but it’s unclear whether this scheme is legal.

Alcaraz topples Djokovic in London. The heir apparent of men’s tennis, 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, defeated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mY?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f326a9c74d6> Novak Djokovic in a five-set epic for his first Wimbledon title (probably the first of many). With his victory, Alcaraz denied a dominant Djokovic a fifth-straight Wimbledon trophy and his 24th major championship overall. “I haven’t played a player like him ever, to be honest,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. On the women’s side, Marketa Vondrousova became the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon.

As downpours drenched the Northeast and canceled flights, a record-breaking heat wave peaked in the US South and West, but temps will remain sizzling throughout this week. In Southern Europe, a dangerous “heat storm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m-?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0687c5140766>” forced the Acropolis in Athens to close for a second day, and over a dozen Italian cities issued heat advisories.

Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation.

It’s a long-promised move by Microsoft to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, across the finish line by tomorrow’s deadline (regulators were worried that Microsoft would make Activision content exclusive to Xbox). All Microsoft needs now to close the deal is the blessing of regulators in the UK.

When you step into a Publix, you always witness greatness, but that became even more apparent last week when soccer legend Lionel Messi was spotted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9n1?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a981e447bf4b> at the South Florida grocery store picking up household staples.

These intergalactic snapshots will make you gasp. Happy first anniversary to the James Webb Space Telescope starting its job. NASA celebrated this week by releasing a new image of a star birth that’s so aesthetically pleasing, you’d think it was AI-generated. The colorful close-up showcases the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, a glowing, swirling collection of 50 young stars that are similar in mass to Earth’s sun—hinting at what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy. JWST is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and since last July, it has sent back dozens of snapshots of the cosmos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lc?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4858f6b02d98> to remind us just how small we really are.

🪺When life gives you spikes, make nests. Crows and magpies living in urban parts of Belgium and the Netherlands are flipping the bird at anti-bird infrastructure. The inventive avians have been ripping out the metal spikes attached to building ledges and repurposing them as construction material. Urban-dwelling birds have been observed incorporating metals, and even barbed wire and syringes, into their abodes before, but one biologist described these spiky tree homes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ld?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=adfd3dee1b74> as “the craziest bird nests” he’s ever seen. And the magpies seem to have taken it a step further: They’re using the spikes to make prickly roofs on their nests, which might serve as a predator defense.

The hills are alive with the sound of silence. If a tree doesn’t fall in the woods, new research suggests that we’d still consider its lack of sound to be…a sound. A Johns Hopkins study has found that people hear silence as a kind of sound rather than an absence of noise. Researchers discovered this by running “sonic illusions,” which typically compare one moment of noise to two shorter moments of noise that together last the same amount of time. Listeners tend to wrongly perceive the uninterrupted moment as lasting longer, and the same thing happened when the single moment of noise was subbed out for silence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9le?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6361738ba12b>.

With some downtowns looking like ghost towns as many workers stay remote, city leaders nationwide want to turn fallow conference rooms into living quarters as an inventive fix. And there are plenty to work with: National office vacancies are at a persistent high of 19.2% (compared to 12.6% in early 2020), according to Cushman & Wakefield. McKinsey predicts that remote work will erase $800 billion from urban office real estate values.

Boston is down with it, being the revolutionary place it is: The city is testing an incentive program <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lg?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=98808c66d56a> for developers to convert empty downtown offices into housing. Mayor Michelle Wu announced this week that the owners of repurposed buildings could get a wicked deal—up to 75% off on their property taxes.

New York Mayor Eric Adams is also proposing incentives to unlock 136 million square feet of office space for residential development, and Seattle held a competition to solicit conversion ideas with cash prizes of $10,000 and $7,500 offered for the top solutions.

Office-to-home advocates say the process will…

* Help drive foot traffic to downtown businesses struggling from a lack of commuters.

* Bolster municipal coffers, as cities often rely on property taxes from office buildings. This revenue would ensure funding for services that make cities attractive places to live and work, like transportation and public safety.

* Supply much-needed housing amid a shortage that has many urbanites paying exorbitant rents and clicking on Zillow’s “buy” tab for daydreaming purposes only.

It’s worked before: A 1995 tax break for conversions helped create 13,000 new apartment units in Lower Manhattan, per the Citizens Budget Commission.

But living in an office probably won’t go mainstream

Making an office tower liveable is much harder than simply bulldozing cubicles and installing bathtubs in the bathrooms due to restrictive zoning and cumbersome regulations. Making Lower Manhattan residential again in the ’90s mostly involved converting prewar buildings that more closely resembled typical apartment buildings.

Modern offices, however, aren’t known for having natural lighting, which the best homes tend to have. Developers converting JP Morgan’s old NYC office <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lh?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0f8fa1af4892> into 1,300 apartments plan to create two sunlight-filled courtyards to keep the new pads from resembling dungeons. Slimmer office towers with less shadowy floor space tend to be easier to repurpose, the national director for office analytics at CoStar Group, Phil Mobley, told Morning Brew.

Some urban experts caution that office-to-home conversions are as comprehensive a remedy for urban planning woes as e-scooters are for transit issues. Since few office buildings are truly suited for conversion, it’s often more straightforward for developers to knock down the existing building and erect condos from scratch. As such, the conversion process is likely to supply only a small portion of the residential square footage that cities need, according <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9li?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ed1cbc480a12> to analysis from the Brookings Institution think tank.

The researchers note that humans tend to require more than a cubicle’s worth of living space, so less people can reside in an office than work in it. That means focusing on condos exclusively might not be the best way to make downtowns vibrant. They suggest that cities also consider filling unused office space with crowd magnets like restaurants, nightclubs, and academic facilities. Brookings argues for relaxed zoning and financial incentives for new housing construction to boost housing supply.

Looking ahead…it’s unclear how long offices will remain empty and available to convert: The amount of newly leased space ticked up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lj?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f47e426c016> last quarter—a sign that talk of an office apocalypse might be premature.—SK

  Place to be: ‘The greatest outdoor show on Earth’ <#> Brody Cress from Hillsdale, Wyoming rides Friday Glory during the Saddle Broinc Championship at the Calgary Stampede Leah Hennel/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

For 10 days in July, Calgary in Alberta, Canada, hosts a massive party celebrating the Western way of life called the Calgary Stampede, an exhibition/rodeo/festival trifecta commonly known as “The greatest outdoor show on Earth.”

This summer’s event wraps up today, but if you enjoy dressing like you’re in the cast of Yellowstone, observing large domesticated animals, drinking beer, and gorging yourself on pancakes, you might want to book your ticket to next year’s Stampede now.

Did we mention the pancakes? They’re a pretty big deal. Free pancake breakfasts have been handed out at the Stampede since 1923, when the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede merged to lay the foundation for the event as it’s known today.

And on the 100th anniversary of the pancake breakfasts this year, Calgary turned up. Organizers handed out 17,182 pancakes during an eight-hour period, which broke the Guinness World Record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ln?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6eb62659151c> (even though 15 pancakes were ultimately disqualified).

The Stampede isn’t without controversy. Animal rights activists have protested the rodeo events, particularly the popular chuckwagon races, which have led to horse deaths.

Those concerns haven’t deterred crowds of wannabe cowboys from descending on Calgary. In 2019, a record 1.28 million visitors attended the Stampede over the 10 days, and this year’s attendance could be the highest yet.—NF

Good morning. The jackpot for tonight’s Powerball drawing has surged to an estimated $875 million—the third-highest jackpot in the game’s history.

To give you a sense of how much money you are not going to win, New Jersey authorities ran the math: If you had enough dollar bills to represent the combined Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots ($1.435 billion) and laid them out on the New Jersey Turnpike side by side across the entire length of the highway…you’d cover it and still have a lot of cash left over. An absolutely useless piece of trivia: Only $1,382,211,601 in dollar bills can fit onto the surface of the Turnpike.

Markets: Wall Street traders went hard yesterday before heading off to their beach houses, pushing the Dow to its best week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m2?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc8cfcd985bc> since March on the news that America’s biggest banks have it made in the shade (more on that in a sec). But it wasn’t all sunshine and surf dreams: The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both dipped, and AT&T sank to its lowest in 29 years after an analyst questioned the potential for slowing growth at the telecom and possible liabilities from its use of lead cables.

 

FINANCE

The biggest banks are making bank <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m3?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A Gif from Workaholics that says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m3?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Workaholics/Comedy Central via Giphy
Banking heavyweights are rolling in it: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m4?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0746604f69cb> expectations-defying quarterly profits yesterday. The financial health of the biggest money houses is closely linked to that of the wider US economy, so let’s all pat ourselves on the back for their success.

Besides signaling that the economy is going strong despite interest rate hikes putting a damper on commercial activity and consumer spending, the big banks’ banner quarter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m5?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=83f3b1708ed5> also reflects how well larger lenders have weathered the banking crisis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m6?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=501529267e62> that claimed three regional banks earlier this year.

Where are the banks raking it in from?

All those Fed rate hikes. They mean the banks can charge clients higher rates for loans. The income from interest on loans at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup combined grew by 31% compared to last year, per the Wall Street Journal.

And the biggest of the big, JPMorgan, has benefited from the industry turmoil that’s been hurting small banks. It reported its highest quarterly profit ever, 67% higher than Q2 last year, thanks in large part to its purchase of collapsed First Republic Bank (along with its affluent client accounts and massive loan portfolio) after regulators took it over in May.

But there are some signs of trouble ahead….

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo gave out less money in home loans compared with last year, and they’ve seen slightly more defaults on credit card debt. And Wells Fargo has put aside more money to cover for potential losses on commercial real-estate loans.

Citigroup’s profit declined 36% from last year as its investment business slowed down, with the recent debt ceiling fight in Congress partially to blame.

And the future of the economy is still anyone’s guess: Of inflation’s recent decline, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN, “I don’t know if it’s going to lead to a soft landing, a mild recession, or a hard recession.” It’s a good reminder that he is not actually a prophet.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> President Joe Biden Win Mcnamee/Getty Images
The Biden administration will wipe out $39 billion of student debt. Yesterday, the  Department of Education announced a rule tweak <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ma?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5ee3cc37d981> that will cancel debt for 804,000 borrowers. The change will impact borrowers who enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, counting more payments toward the forgiveness that is available to them after 20 or 25 years worth of payments are made. The update comes after President Biden vowed to find other ways to provide relief when his plan to forgive $400 billion in federal student loan debt got nixed by the Supreme Court last month.

Authorities think they finally caught the Gilgo Beach serial killer. More than a decade after young women’s bodies began turning up on a remote stretch of Long Island, a suspect has been apprehended <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mb?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=60b60800bdba> and charged. Local architect Rex Heuermann pleaded not guilty yesterday to the murders of three out of 11 people whose killings inspired the 2020 Netflix film Lost Girls. Law enforcement says they’ve matched Heuermann’s DNA to materials found on the victims’ remains and that he’s the prime suspect in a fourth Gilgo killing, too. Heuermann is being held without bail and will have his next court appearance on August 1.

There’s been no shortage of record-high temperatures around the globe recently, and since “space fan” isn't something NASA is currently working on, other scientists are picking up the slack to cool buildings down.

Some options:

Going underground. Geothermal heat pumps <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9md?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b32058e6445e> don’t use natural gas to cool and heat your home. Instead pipes buried hundreds of feet beneath your yard send water underground that circulates back cooler due to temperature differences below the surface. It’s got big advantages over traditional air conditioning and heating because it uses far less electricity and is cheaper in the long run. It’s typically more expensive upfront, but a 30% tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act could change that.

The whitest paint in the world. We’re talking paint so white it would share a sandwich with its dog. A team of scientists at Purdue University created <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9me?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ffc061f00cda> a white paint that reflects 98% of sunlight (most white paints only reflect 80%–90%). It won’t be ready for commercial use for at least a year, but it promises to decrease the need for air conditioning inside a building by about 40%.

Big picture: Developers of these technologies know paint and underground tubes are just a Band-Aid for a planet currently getting cooked. Stay safe if you’re one of the 90 million people in the US under heat alerts this weekend.—MM

Launching a product? Consider getting a tattoo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mi?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Entrepreneurs with tattoos could get more crowdfunding, says a new study. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mi?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo Collage: Getty Images/Cameron Abbas
Forget what your parents told you: Those tattoos that they said would hurt your professional future could actually help you rake in more money for your business.

On the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, product campaigns with photos of inked-up people receive significantly more backers and contributions than the campaigns that just show a bunch of normies, according to a new study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mj?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=baab2ad5748a>.

Featuring tats is especially beneficial for nonartsy products, like smart glasses or other tech, because research shows it signals unexpected creativity to backers that makes them more inclined to donate.

Nonartistic products receive 458 more backers and $27,000 more in funding, on average, when entrepreneurs chose to feature body art—whether on themselves or models—in campaign photos.

Artistic campaigns showing some ink only drew an average of 128 more backers, possibly because they’re already seen as creative.

But…while tattoos help propel crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter—where most of the backers are under 35 and likely to be chill with body art or have some of their own—your parents might still be right about keeping your ink covered around traditional investors. “You won’t see Warren Buffett rolling up his sleeves and showing tattoos,” one researcher told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mk?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=077f198654c3> the Wall Street Journal.—ML

Stat: If you’ve been daydreaming about how sweet it would be to have your private jet touch down in Sun Valley or what you’d eat at Kristen Bell’s dinner party, know that according to a new study by SmartAsset, you need to make more than $650,000 a year to rank among the wealthiest 1% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mo?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=47261ae0efbf> of US households. And in some states, it takes even more income to run with the summer-is-a-verb crowd: In Connecticut, where you need the most cash to get out of the 99%, it requires raking in $953,000 annually—before taxes.

Quote: “Aspartame is one of the most studied food additives in the human food supply. FDA scientists do not have safety concerns when aspartame is used under the approved conditions.”

Pop open an ice-cold Diet Coke because the FDA has proclaimed that it is officially not on board <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mp?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c7d8833f74e5> with the WHO’s finding that the artificial sweetener it uses (as do ~6,000 other products) may cause cancer. The FDA said it had reviewed the studies the WHO used to determine that aspartame is a carcinogen and found “significant shortcomings.” It also noted that the WHO hadn’t changed the acceptable daily intake for the sweetener. So, even if the FDA doesn’t have you convinced that there’s nothing to see here, you’re likely safely below the limit.

Good morning. Earlier this week a story spread across the internet (including in Monday’s Brew) that people in 17 states would be treated to a northern lights display today.

Unfortunately, that forecast was never true, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which was cited as the source of the forecast.

For most of us, tonight’s sky will be the same as it always is: dark and full of terrors.

It’s official: 160,000 actors, announcers, game show hosts, and even the people who pretend to be Harrison Ford tucking and rolling through booby-trapped temples are going on strike. Their union, SAG-AFTRA, did not reach a deal with the studios, meaning they will join the already striking Writers Guild of America (WGA) on the picket line.

It’s the first time writers and actors have been on strike together since 1960, but both groups are now seeking better pay as streaming transforms the entertainment industry landscape, as well as assurances that studios aren’t going to replace them with AI.

So, what happens now?

The WGA strike, now in its third month, has already shuttered most film and TV production in New York, LA, and even Chicago, and with the actors joining in, the few projects that were proceeding with already written scripts will now shut down. Plus, the SAG-AFTRA strike now keeps members from filming projects overseas, too, so the highly anticipated House of the Dragon and part two of Mission: Impossible –Dead Reckoning will have to halt filming.

SAG-AFTRA strike rules also bar actors from participating in promotional activities <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9eZ?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f06fef274611>. So, premieres like the one for Disney’s Haunted Mansion won’t be star-studded, and Margot Robbie’s pink carpet couture is going back in the Barbie trunk.

And hopefully the Emmys didn’t already print invites: Even though we all tweeted our congrats to Jennifer Coolidge on her nomination yesterday, the people in charge will likely push the ceremony from September to January to avoid having a show with no famous people.

Tour de headlines <#> Bob Iger on Fox Business Network's Michael Loccisano/Getty Images
Bob Iger plans to stay at the House of Mouse for a while. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who returned to the role to replace Bob Chapek in November, has agreed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fy?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d9d9f87e9f6a> to lead the company through 2026—two years longer than originally planned. Iger has already begun a restructuring that included laying off 7,000 employees as the company contends with the transition to streaming, dwindling park attendance, and a feud with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The extension will give Disney extra time to pick a successor to take the reins once Iger steps down.

It’s getting hotter in the water. Ocean temperatures <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f2?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=92daebc5891e> off the coast of Florida have climbed to unprecedented highs of nearly 97 degrees Fahrenheit, when readings in the 80s would be more typical. The temps are so high that they’re off the color scale of some weather maps, according to the Washington Post. The Jacuzzi-like temperatures pose a major danger to the coral in the area, which is likely to bleach (meaning turn white from starvation)—especially since it’s only July and corals usually suffer most from the heat in August and September.

Fox News got hit with another defamation suit. Tucker Carlson may be broadcasting on Twitter now, but he’s still causing headaches for his former employer. Trump supporter Ray Epps sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fz?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c4a67d67976d> the network, claiming the bow-tied host pushed the “fantastical story” on Fox that Epps was an undercover FBI agent who instigated the violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, rather than being a regular protester. Of course, it was the fallout from Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against Fox, which the network settled for $787.5 million, that got Carlson booted from the network in April.

ECONOMY

Inflation, unlike the climate, is cooling down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f3?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Stack of money frozen in ice cube <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f3?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Get ready to make hella frittatas because it looks like the days of $14 eggs are behind us. Inflation cooled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f4?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7ede69b7c5cb> to a two-year low of 3% last month, according to government data released yesterday—meaning the worst of the crisis is probably over.

Core inflation (which takes out volatile food and energy prices) rose only 0.2% in June—its slowest pace since early 2021.

Not all prices are coming down, though. According to the Wall Street Journal’s deep dive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f5?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0806a2dbb671> into the data, there are still some things to avoid buying if you want to hang on to your cash:

Don’t: Burn your toast, chug Diet Coke, or eat frozen peas. The price of white bread increased 11.5% over the past year, carbonated drinks went up 9.1%, and frozen vegetables jumped 17.6%.

Do: Go on a road trip, buy a 55-inch LCD, and attend a destination wedding. Gas is down 27%, TVs prices decreased 10%, and airline fares dropped 19%.

Big picture: It looks like the Fed’s string of interest rate hikes have done their job. But inflation remains above the 2% target, so JPow and friends are expected to raise rates later this month. Experts say it’ll likely be the last increase for a while.—CC

The world’s biggest cruise ship is coming soon, and it would probably send a Victorian child into a coma.

Longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall, Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas is a Pimp My Ride fever dream <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fa?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=13e4b651e90e> that just passed its first sea trials. It’s got twenty decks, more than 40 venues for wining and dining, an ice rink, a 55-foot waterfall, nine whirlpools, and an open-air “Central Park” with real foliage.

The new ship is five times larger than the Titanic, and while some people (and orcas <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70t?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aaaf91eda14e>, if they could Tweet) are calling it a dystopian monstrosity <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fb?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1dfe8c0c157b>, plenty of eager cruisers have already booked passage on the big ship.

Royal Caribbean had its largest-ever booking day when Icon tickets, which started at $1,537, dropped last October.

All 5,610 passenger spots on the Icon’s inaugural January 2024 voyage from Miami to the Caribbean are sold out. But more seven-night trips later in the year are still available, and those looking to hit the candy-colored waterslides like a baller can spring for a suite at ~$10,864 per person.

Zoom out: After suffering a 15-month pandemic shutdown, cruises have come back even bigger. Next year, 36 million people are expected to vacation at sea, compared to 29.7 million in 2019, according to the Cruise Line International Association.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> A half pink, half muted ticket Francis Scialabba
Stat: Moviegoers will soon be coming to AMC for twice the magic: Barbenheimer—a double feature of the upcoming films Barbie and Oppenheimer—has moved from internet obsession to driver of actual ticket sales. More than 20,000 people have already ordered tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ff?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d67e4fd25c4a> from the theater chain to experience the peanut-butter-and-pickles-like pairing of a movie about a doll discovering the world outside her hot-pink Dreamhouse and another about the creation of the atomic bomb. And the meme-turned-IRL five-hour commitment isn’t just a US phenomenon: UK cinema chain Vue told Bloomberg that 19% percent of Oppenheimer ticket buyers also purchased Barbie tickets.

Good morning. If you see people walking around this evening looking like they don’t have a purpose in life, they’re probably sports fans. Today, the day after the MLB All-Star Game, is considered the slowest sports day of the year, with none of the Big Four North American leagues holding competitive games.

But there are still sports on, and we’re especially pumped for this morning’s Wimbledon quarterfinal match featuring the American underdog, Christopher Eubanks, against world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev. No one expected Eubanks to reach this point in the tournament—not even himself. He’s extended his hotel reservation in London three times already.

Let’s send it back to fourth grade real quick: Scientists divide the geological history of the Earth into stages, such as epochs, periods, and eras, which are defined by fundamental shifts in the natural world.

For the last 11,700 years, we’ve been living in the Holocene epoch. But a group of renegade scientists argues that a new epoch began in the mid-20th century: the Anthropocene <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cJ?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4d489c1b0908>.

Those scientists, who make up the Anthropocene Working Group, advanced their claims in a big way yesterday by selecting a “golden spike,” or one physical spot that marks an epoch, for the proposed Anthropocene: Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada.

What is the Anthropocene? It’s the first epoch defined by humans rather than Mother Nature, and it reflects the (harmful) impact that Homo sapiens have had on the Earth. Scientists chose Crawford Lake because “it contained the clearest and most pronounced evidence of humankind’s influence on the global geologic record,” per the New York Times.

The most significant change in the lake’s sediment is a sharp increase in radioactive plutonium around 1950.

The lake’s mud also reveals heightened levels of ash and nitrogen, reflecting pollution from fossil fuels.

But the Anthropocene is still in review

Scientists are conflicted about whether the Anthropocene should be labeled a new epoch in Earth’s geological history.

Opponents argue that the period of human influence, however significant, is just a blip in the history of the world. Most epochs span at least a few million years; the Anthropocene would be just ~70 years old.

But that’s why other scientists say it should be formally codified. Humans have made outsized changes to the Earth in the relatively infinitesimal amount of time we’ve spent on the planet. Many experts believe that marking that impact in history books could inspire an attitude shift in the struggle to mitigate climate change.

Looking ahead…in the coming years, two big-name international scientific bodies—the International Commission on Stratigraphy and the International Union of Geological Sciences—will decide if the Anthropocene should be considered an official epoch. But the decision is going to be contentious: The battle over the Anthropocene has already caused a split within the scientific community, and some members of the Anthropocene Working Group have resigned due to contrasting opinions.—CC

Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard cleared for landing. A federal judge rejected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cN?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3be309a908b7> the FTC’s attempt to stop Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, paving the way for the $69 billion deal to close as soon as this month. The FTC argued that the takeover would result in less competition in the video game industry and limit access to Activision’s blockbuster games, but the judge disagreed, saying, “To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.” While the deal still needs UK regulators’ approval, they also signaled yesterday they would let it proceed.

Bank of America slapped with $250 million in fines for “junk fees.” Regulators penalized the US’ second-biggest bank for a series of consumer abuses <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cO?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d8ed055e39ee>, including opening credit card accounts without consent, charging overdraft fees twice, and improperly withholding credit card rewards. The fines are part of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) war against junk fees—e.g., overdraft charges—that added hundreds of millions of dollars to Bank of America’s top line between 2018 and 2022. Last year, Wells Fargo reached a $3.7 billion settlement with the CFBP over junk fees.

PGA Tour officials said a merger with LIV was the only option.

Sympathetic Republican Sen. Ron Johnson pointed out that LIV has 500x the financial resources as the PGA Tour, but Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized the PGA Tour for compromising its values for money. The DOJ is investigating the PGA–LIV deal over antitrust concerns, Blumenthal said.

Local officials feared that an upstream dam within a few feet of overflowing could dump even more floodwater onto city streets.

We’ve spent so much time making Barbenheimer jokes that we’ve missed the real theatrical main character this summer: IMAX screens.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters today, and usually a Tom Cruise action film would dominate the sprawling screens. But Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb movie, Oppenheimer, will be evicting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cZ?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa630779efcd> Mission: Impossible from IMAX earlier than Cruise would like.

Mission: Impossible will have just nine days on IMAX screens before the Nolan flick that is supposed to devastate all of us opens on July 21. Oppenheimer will then occupy every IMAX theater in North America for three whole weeks, a week longer than similar big-screen deals.

Cruise is mad about getting evicted.

But it’s not about the money. If it were, Mission: Impossible would win. The movie is expected to easily double Oppenheimer’s first weekend of box-office sales. Instead, it’s about rewarding a diehard fan. The CEO of IMAX told Variety, “Nolan has a special place in IMAX’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us.”—MM

As a shortage of Huy Fong’s famous sauce enters its second year, resellers on sites like Amazon and eBay are hawking Sriracha for up to 10x <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d2?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1df0958e9df4> the original price, USA Today reports. And people are buying it—one 12-pack went for $415, or $34.58 per bottle, while another seller thinks they can nab $80 for a single container. The shortage, which stems from a bad crop of the chili peppers used to make the sauce, shows no signs of easing, and that’s devastating news because the knockoff Trader Joe’s version just isn’t cutting it.

Quote: “Of course, it’s unfortunate. This is perfectly good milk.”

There may not be enough Sriracha, but there’s too much milk. John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, lamented how dairy farms across the Upper Midwest are spilling milk into the sewers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d3?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bc7c0cadd4ee> because they have nowhere to send the perishable liquid. US milk production is at a record high, but demand isn’t keeping up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d4?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26d16f3fa015>: Kids are drinking less milk since they’re out of school, and plants processing milk into cheese are at capacity.

 ✳︎ A Note From Facet

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities.

We all have a friend who’s never in a rush to fulfill our gentle post-night-out Venmo request, and once they do pay, it takes another few days for the money to travel from the app to your bank account. While your flaky friend might be incorrigible, the second part of the wait could soon become a thing of the past: The Fed is launching <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/98_?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8d693f6c1736> its FedNow instant payment service later this month.

The new system will enable banks to send each other cash instantly, 24/7, as an alternative to the existing system that runs only during normal business hours and often takes days to move money.

This puts America’s banking system on track to catch up to countries like India and Nigeria, where high-speed payments are as common as high-speed rail in Japan. The US does already have an instant payments system, but it’s private rather than government-backed, and it hasn’t been widely adopted. It’s mostly only used by big banks, and only 1.4% of US transactions happen in real time, according to ACI Worldwide, a payment systems company.

FedNow-enabled services will likely appear at 41 banks that have so far said they’ll participate, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.

People moving money between banks or paying bills could complete their transactions in seconds, without the need to plan payments days in advance.

Businesses will be able to access customer payments immediately and they could send workers payments more frequently with instant direct deposit rather than the usual payroll cycle.

Faster payments could mean faster bank runs

Some experts worry that giving people the ability to drain their bank accounts instantaneously could make SVB-style <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/990?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=75e26de9b056> bank runs more likely.

Smaller banks struggling with liquidity would have even less time to react to customer panic and get collateral for emergency government loans to cover fleeing cash.

But there are safeguards built in. FedNow has a $500,000 transaction limit, and banks can set their own ceilings to ensure that customers don’t pull their deposits faster than they can say “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.”—SK

Floods in the Northeast threaten lives and destroy roads. Around 9 million people were under flood warnings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/994?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a9fb72fa6a3f> yesterday and some areas experienced once-in-a-millennium levels of rainfall as storms that began on Sunday pummeled the Northeastern US. New York’s Hudson Valley, where at least one person died in the storm, and Vermont, where flash flood risks were high and rain fell at a rate of 1.5 inches per hour, were hit especially hard. Thousands of flights were canceled and delayed, and major roads were damaged and even washed away.

Turkey to roll out the NATO welcome mat for Sweden at last.

Though there are still steps left before Sweden officially becomes a NATO member, with that issue largely resolved the talk of today’s big NATO summit in Lithuania is likely to be about how to handle another country that’s eager to join: Ukrain Ozempic and another weight-loss drug investigated for suicide risk. The EU’s drug regulator has opened a probe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/996?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=886b00ec945f> into reports that Novo Nordisk’s drugs Ozempic and Saxenda, and others containing semaglutide or liraglutide, are linked to thoughts of suicide and self-harm based on three incidents from Iceland. The agency may also decide to consider other drugs in the same class, which are among the most popular in the world and are also made by other pharma companies. In the US, Wegovy (another Novo semaglutide-based medicine) already carries a warning for suicidal behavior—even though clinical trials of the drug did not find it elevated the risk—because other weight-loss drugs did pose the risk, according to Bloomberg.

Say a little prayer for Aretha Franklin’s sons <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99c?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99c?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Aretha Franklin's sons have taken the fight over her estate to court.
The children of the Queen of Soul are duking it out in court to see who will take control of the late singer’s multimillion-dollar estate.

Aretha Franklin did not leave behind a formal, typed-out will, but two handwritten versions were discovered in her home after her death in 2018. Yesterday, a trial <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99d?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6813baf561e> began in Michigan where lawyers for two of the singer’s four sons will argue that a 2014 handwritten note—signed with a smiley face and stuffed in a sofa—counts as her last will and testament. Another son favors a contradictory, notarized 2010 version.

Both documents appear to split Franklin’s royalties among her children and require that the three competing brothers support her fourth son, who has a disability.

But the wills differ on who gets her personal property and on who takes charge of the estate.

Kecalf and Edward Franklin are vying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99e?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a04158d861a1> for the 2014 document, which names Kecalf as executor and leaves him with his mother’s house, cars, jewelry, and the fur coats she’d famously let slide off her shoulders onstage. Franklin’s third son, Ted White II, favors the 2010 will that names him as executor and bars Kecalf and Edward from their inheritances until they get business degrees or certificates.—ML

Turns out that watching Hilary Farr call a perfectly normal living room “cringe” is not good for your relationship with your home.

A new study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/998?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=581bd54c9d54> from the Journal of Consumer Research found home renovation media is responsible for a shift toward standardization, according to analysis from the Washington Post.

Meet the “market-reflected gaze.” That’s what the study dubbed the internalized idea that a future homebuyer can (and will) judge your decorating choices. In an effort to maintain the value of their home, people are ignoring their own preferred design choices in favor of mainstream elements like neutral finishes, stainless-steel appliances, and Pinterest-popular decor.

That beige open-living floor plan might be good when it’s time to sell, it’s arguably bad for your soul: Some of the study’s 17 participants said that they wished they put more personalization into their home, with one likening her own bathroom to one in a hotel room.

Bottom line: Design really does impact resale value. Even if you hate charcoal-gray kitchens, you should have one—it could increase the value of your home by $2,512, per a Zillow analysis.—CC

If you missed the tweet, it’s probably because you were over on Threads with everyone else, seeing what your favorite potato chip brand had to say. Meta’s Twitter clone hit 100 million users just five days after its launch, taking the crown for the fastest-growing platform ever from ChatGPT . Similarweb’s data shows Twitter’s traffic down 5% for the two days after the wide release of Threads, per CNBC. But it’s still got a ways to go to catch Twitter, which has ~250 million users arguing with one another.

Good morning. Elton John has performed “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” in concerts 1,475 times over the past 50 years, according to Setlist.fm, but he might have sung it for the final time Saturday night when he closed out his marathon tour in Sweden. John’s farewell tour, which began in 2018 and spanned 333 shows, is the highest grossing tour ever, bringing in more than $900 million.

The record may not stand for long. Taylor Swift’s and Beyoncé’s ongoing stadium-bursting tours could each bring in more than $1 billion, and Beyoncé only just arrived in North America this weekend with shows in Toronto.

Did you know you can disable a Waymo or Cruise robotaxi by placing an orange traffic cone on its hood?

A group of activists in San Francisco found out you can, and they’re using the tactic to protest driverless taxis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95J?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e76acef1e8fa> taking over their city’s streets. The group, which calls itself Safe Street Rebel, has been putting traffic cones on robotaxis’ hoods to stop them from operating and has been giving instructions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95K?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0223e337c24> on social media to encourage others to make their own immobile orange unicorns.

The anti-robotaxi vigilantism comes ahead of a major hearing this week that could allow Cruise and Waymo, two autonomous vehicle companies with robotaxi services in SF, to expand their operations in the city to a level comparable to Uber’s and Lyft’s.

Why the pushback?

As regulations on Waymo and Cruise have slowly lifted, they’ve become a “ubiquitous presence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95L?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c51f056b457>” in San Francisco, the Washington Post reports. But without a human at the wheel, these cars have gotten into situations perfect for the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme music—for example, a swarm of them stopped moving <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95M?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e05ea321ec8e> at an intersection last summer, blocking traffic for hours.

But frustrated people in San Francisco say they didn’t sign up to be guinea pigs in Big Tech’s experiments. And safety leaders are sounding off: The city’s fire chief, Jeanine Nicholson, told MarketWatch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95N?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d9afcd58a42e> that malfunctioning robotaxis have blocked first responders from getting where they need to go, and in the case of a growing fire, every second matters. “They are not ready for prime time,” Nicholson said of the autonomous vehicles.

The coneheads have been called “anti-progress”

Robotaxi companies and proponents of driverless cars say these hiccups are just the growing pains of a complex technology that will ultimately save many lives. Human drivers are incredibly lethal, after all, and a robot never needs to check their texts while driving. Accessibility advocates, economic development organizations, and elected officials are in Waymo’s and Cruise’s corner, so the robotaxi expansion is expected to pass at the hearing later this week.

Looking ahead…proving that robotaxis can successfully navigate SF’s hilly and winding roads would be a big step for Waymo and Cruise as they aim to bring driverless services to other US cities.

The NBA announces an in-season tournament. NBA teams floundering in the league’s regular season will still have a shot at a trophy: Commissioner Adam Silver said the NBA will stage its first in-season tournament <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95R?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0cc79c4e9599> in November and December, with teams competing in a group stage for a chance to play in a “Final Four”-style round in Las Vegas. Silver said the new tradition was inspired by European soccer, which hosts several concurrent tournaments throughout the year, such as the Champions League. Also in the NBA, No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama showed he has some things to learn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95S?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3dcc95f7b24e> in his Summer League debut for the Spurs.

The US has a toxic lead cable problem. The US has more than 2,000 cables covered in toxic lead that present a health hazard and have gone unaddressed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95T?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7635a1500d2> by the telecom companies that laid them, a WSJ investigation found. Over decades, lead on these pipes has degraded into the soil and water in populated areas, including where kids go to school and people fish. No amount of contact with lead is safe, doctors say, which is why the US has elliminated the metal from products like paint and gasoline. This report may spark a closer look at lead from telecom cables.

Critics shot back that this kind of content is necessary to keep a platform from turning into a milquetoast playground for brands and influencers. Meanwhile, Threads adoption has continued to skyrocket: More than 70 million users had signed up as of Friday, including the account tracking Elon Musk’s private jet.

Does Prime get you too amped? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95V?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Logan Paul and KSI pose with Prime hydration bottles prior to a regular season game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 31, 2023, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CA. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95V?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
US lawmakers want to know. Yesterday, NY Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer asked the FDA to investigate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95W?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f6fcd6af720d> Prime, the hot new energy drink created by YouTube superstars Logan Paul and KSI last year.

The problem Schumer and health experts have with Prime is that a) it contains an egregious amount of caffeine and b) it’s incredibly popular among teens and kids, for whom egregious amounts of caffeine can have negative health impacts, such as anxiety and heart problems. It’s already been banned in some schools around the world.

So how much caffeine is in Prime? 200 milligrams per 12 ounces, the same as almost two Red Bulls or six Coke cans.

Prime seems to be aware that teens shouldn’t be drinking 200 mg of caffeine in four gulps, which is why the company slapped a “not recommended for children under 18” label on its drink. It has another drink, Prime Hydration, that has zero caffeine, but Schumer says that the company does not sufficiently differentiate between the two in its onslaught of social media marketing.

Bottom line: It’s going to take a powerful gravitational force to slow down Prime’s ascent. The brand rode its cult-like following to $250 million in retail sales in its first year, and it’s become the “official” sports drink of the LA Dodgers and FC Barcelona.

Is the buzz from your morning brew a placebo effect? New research on our namesake found coffee to be more brain-boosting than straight caffeine alone. Whether people have a cup of joe or a plain caffeine alternative, they feel alert afterward, but people who drank coffee <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94S?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=967e2418732b> also showed better memory and goal-directed behavior, according to brain scans. The study’s main author says people might feel these coffee-specific benefits because they associate the smell, taste, and experience of drinking coffee with seizing the day. More research is needed to see whether withdrawal relief plays a role and if decaf has similar go-get-’em effects.

The converter has one more stage of prototyping to go before it’s ready for prime time, but it’s entering a market that’s expected to balloon nearly 40% annually between now and 2029, per HTF Market Intelligence.

Static electricity propels ticks to their next meal. As if there weren’t enough reasons to hate the little bloodsuckers, ticks have been found to ride the pull of a static charge onto passing humans or animals. After dragging bedsheets through the woods and bringing the buggy haul back to the lab for experiments, scientists learned that the low-level electric field natural to living things can attract ticks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94U?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=99250cfa6419> from a few millimeters or even centimeters away. But knowing about this attraction might ultimately help us repel the disease-ridden creatures: Future experiments could explore if an antistatic spray keeps the ticks away.—ML

  Place to be: The islands with big Viking energy <#> Neolithic stones in the Orkney Islands A Neolithic stone circle on the Orkney Islands. Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

In the mid-15th century, the Orkney Islands were handed over from Norweigan and Danish control to Scotland as a dowry payment for a royal wedding.

Now, they might want to return. Feeling overlooked and underloved by the UK, Orkney Islands councilors voted last week to investigate other options for governance, such as becoming a more autonomous British crown dependency or even rejoining Norway after more than 550 years of separation.

It’s clear why reentering Norway’s orbit is attractive—in many ways, the Orkneys never left. While this cluster of about 70 low-lying islands is located just ~10 miles north of the Scottish mainland, it wears its Viking legacy proudly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95E?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9eeaf55b8a77>, even depicting bearded Norsemen on its ferries. Vikings first landed in the Orkneys in the late 8th century, found the place lovely, and ended up staying for another 500 years.

Tourists have also found the place lovely. Of course, on islands inhabited for ~8,500 years, there is a bounty of historical gems to take in, such as the 5,000-year-old village Skara Brae. But the islands have also played an important role in modern history because of their strategic location. Scapa Flow, one of the largest natural harbors in the world, is the final resting place of many doomed World War II ships.

When you’ve had your fill of the Neolithic ruins, you can check out the Orkneys’ other delights <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/950?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=34605e430ad4>, like puffin colonies, seafood, and scenic walks along the coast.

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked you to pick one: a porch, patio, yard, rooftop, or deck. Here are our favorite responses:

* “Rooftop…I live in the mountains of northern Arizona and have breathtaking views. Plus, spitting seeds at my kids and them not realizing it’s me is definitely a bonus.”—Jonathan from Prescott, AZ

* “Front porch, because talking to your neighbors died with the back deck!”—Syd from NC

* “Definitely going with a large deck to put multiple cold plunges on. Me and the boys are staying cool this summer.”—Dustin from Edwards, CO

* “Screened-in porch. I grew up spending lots of time at Grandma’s, and there was something magical about sitting on the porch in the summer during a torrential downpour. You’re outside in the rain but inside and dry being taught how to play Casino and eating stuffed cabbage.”—Laurence (Grandma’s was in Far Rockaway, NY)

* “Definitely a yard. Mowing that is free therapy.”—Isaac

* “A covered porch. Too hot in Georgia to sit outside without some shade! Rooftop?? Northern idiots!”—Gary from Georgia

Good morning. PSA for anyone who is getting married and preparing to send a million thank-you notes: The price of a USPS first-class “Forever” stamp is rising from 63 cents to 66 cents, effective tomorrow.

You don’t hear a lot about stamp inflation, but it’s been soaring. The price of stamps has jumped 32% since early 2019 when they cost just 50 cents. Then again, the USPS has to make up for emptier mailboxes somehow. Volume for first-class mail (which encompasses letters) has plunged 51% since 2006.

Gen Z: You saved tinned fish and cottage cheese. Now bring back pen pals.

If you spent the past few days fanning your pits while crouching in front of a cranked up AC and housing down cherry Icees, get used to it.

Earth just keeps shattering temperature records <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/954?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=86b73dbfd90f>.

Monday ranked as Earth’s hottest day in 100,000+ years. Then the globe pulled a three-peat as each subsequent day through Thursday broke the heat record set the day before, making July 3–6 the hottest four days on record.

The steamy week followed the warmest June ever, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

And it’s no better down where it’s wetter: Sea ice levels off the coast of Antarctica have hit record lows, and the North Atlantic has recently broken temperature records…by a lot.

Why now? According to researchers, the rising mercury can be attributed to a combination of global climate change from human greenhouse gas emissions and the naturally occurring El Niño phenomenon, which raises temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and tends to bring hotter weather with it. So, we’re likely in for even more blistering days as July progresses—and possibly even the hottest year ever.

The dangerous heat levels are already impacting how we live and work.

Heat safety has been a major sticking point in the ongoing, contentious negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters Union that represents its drivers, causing the company to tentatively agree to air condition its trucks.

Beijing halted all outside work this week as the city experienced its longest streak of days above 95 degrees Fahrenheit since 1961.

But there are hopeful signs: If it’s going to keep getting hotter, we’ll have to figure out how to deal with it, while also weaning ourselves off the fossil fuels that contribute to climate change—and sweltering Texas has provided an example of how that might work. The state’s been able to keep its power grid running despite the heat wave thanks in large part to its solar and wind <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/955?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=de710575264c> energy supply.—AR

It’s been 500 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. As the conflict drags on <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/959?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b387c803c63b>, the fighting has reached a stalemate, though Ukraine is hoping to turn the tide with its recently launched counteroffensive. That effort got a boost yesterday after the US made the controversial decision to send cluster munitions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95a?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=447549f59cfe>, which are small scattered bombs that are banned in many countries because of their potential to harm civilians. Whoever ultimately wins, the war has already been a humanitarian disaster—the UN estimates at least 9,000 civilians have been killed. It has also impacted the global economy as most Western businesses have pulled out of Russia, and several nations have worked to wean themselves off Russian oil.

If you want an Apple headset, you’ll need an appointment. Desperate to strap Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro onto your face? Know that the mixed-reality headset’s rollout <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95b?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f36aedd61e4> is going to be a slow one. Bloomberg reports that the iPhone-maker will require in-store appointments, and that initially these will only be available at stores in major cities. Apple has also scaled back its ambitions: According to the Financial Times, after previously projecting it would sell a million headsets in the first year, the company is now planning for just 400,000. But, if you’re willing to wait, Apple is said to be planning a cheaper version and a second-gen Vision Pro for 2026.

It’s Taylor Swift’s world, we’re just living in it. If you somehow missed why the entire internet spent the day obsessing over a one-line lyric change to a 13-year-old song, it’s because Swift dropped her rerelease <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95c?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=be84b44e7c56> of Speak Now at midnight yesterday. She nixed the controversial reference to an actress being better known for “things that she does on a mattress” in “Better Than Revenge.” It’s the third re-recorded album she’s put out since announcing plans to revisit her first six to get control after the master recordings were sold to her enemy Scooter Braun—and the first two have outsold their original releases.

It’s summertime, baby, which means ice cream trucks are jingling, Friday beers are flowing, and private chefs are baking zucchini bread in the Hamptons.

Equipped with unfettered access to their employers’ herb gardens, kitchen wizzes are heading to the beach with the rich and famous—and they’re giving us drool-worthy glimpses into their homes and stomachs (but usually not their names) on TikTok. The platform said views of videos tagged with #privatechef have more than quadrupled since last June to surpass the one-billion mark, as people discover the escapist thrill of watching someone feed the Kardashian kids for a living.

These TikToks frequently feature white-marble kitchen islands, multi-thousand-dollar organic grocery hauls, and heirloom tomato pies.

But business is booming, and up-and-coming private chefs have started leveraging TikTok to bypass the it’s-who-you-know barriers to entry and book steady client work and brand deals.—ML

Though 16 people have died in the running since 1910, per the AP, no one was gored yesterday, and only six people suffered minor injuries. The dangers of the run don’t seem to stop people from flocking to the Spanish city to live out their Hemingway-inspired dreams—1.7 million tourists came to the festival last year and even more are expected this year now that all Covid restrictions have been lifted.

When you order, make sure you remember the four rules of soft-serve: a kiddie size is a medium, a small is a large, no biting allowed, and a regular cone > sugar cone.

Have a great one, we’ll see you tomorrow morning.

What is Threads? The hot new way for companies to ask if pineapple belongs on pizza for the 1,000th time. Threads is Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s attempt to do what many others have tried and failed before him: Bring over the public conversation from Twitter to a rival app.

Threads has impressive early traction, which can be attributed to users’ ability to link it to their existing Instagram accounts and port over followers. That’s why the app has a distinctly Michael Rubin White Party <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94w?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=317fbc0d21d9> vibe in its early days, with celebrities like the Kardashians and brands dominating the algorithmically curated feed.

How is Threads different from Twitter?

Well, that algorithmically curated feed, for one. The Meta team said it’s looking into creating a “following”-only feed, but right now you’re stuck sorting through influencers and verified accounts to find your friends—unlike Twitter, which offers a “for you” feed and a “following” feed.

Here are some other differences between the two apps:

Threads is pretty much mobile-only as it’s extremely limited on desktop. Meta said a desktop version is in the works.

Threads does not have a reverse-chronological feed.

There are no hashtags or keyword search functions in Threads, so users can’t follow trending topics or events in real-time like on Twitter. These functions are also on the list for future updates, according to Meta.

Threads doesn’t have DMs to slide into.

Musk fires back

Facing its most significant threat yet, Twitter threatened to sue <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94x?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=861f95c510d8> Meta, accusing the company of poaching its employees to build Threads. Twitter lawyer Alex Spiro demanded that “Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information.”

In a statement to Semafor, Meta’s comms head Andy Stone denied hiring ex-Twitter employees to work on the Threads engineering team, saying “that’s just not a thing.”

Bottom line: Zuck has to be feeling good right now, having built an easily monetizable user base that’s already 13% of Twitter’s 229 million users in less than a day. But Threads is in its early days, and it remains to be seen whether it’s the Twitter killer everyone has been waiting for, a boring version of Instagram, or something else entirely.

OceanGate suspends its operations. The company that made the doomed Titan submersible said on its website it has “suspended all exploration <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/941?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ef4fee8df8ce> and commercial operations.” OceanGate’s CEO, Stockton Rush, died along with four passengers in the sub that presumably imploded on its way to visit the Titanic shipwreck in the North Atlantic last month. The Coast Guard’s highest level of investigation, a convening of the Marine Board of Investigation, will probe the disaster and expects to hold public hearings into what happened, per the AP.

The world’s largest spherical structure made its flashy debut this week, and you’ll never guess where it’s located.

That’s a joke—it’s obviously in Las Vegas. The MSG Sphere, a $2.3 billion venue one block east of the Vegas Strip, was fully illuminated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/947?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=205516f902d6> for the first time on July 4, and it’s already promising to overshadow other Vegas landmarks with its dominating physical presence and sensory-blasting capabilities.

This 366-foot-tall sphere is wrapped in 1.2 million LEDs—which together allegedly form the largest video screen on Earth—that can display anything one would want to display on a large sphere in the world’s entertainment capital. On July Fourth, the Sphere turned into a spooky eyeball <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/948?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0a2611008165> and an American flag and teased holiday-themed visuals like a snow globe and a jack-o’-lantern. It can also become a moon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/949?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e234318825ce> that will make you feel like you’re on Tatooine.

But this thing isn’t hollow. Inside the Sphere is an arena that can fit nearly 18,000 people, and it’s slated to hold concerts, movies, and—since this is Vegas—sporting events like MMA and boxing.

Looking ahead…the Sphere will open on September 29 with a worthy act: U2.—NF

Good morning. On this day in 1957, Paul McCartney (age 15) first met John Lennon (16) at a garden party at St. Peter’s, Woolton’s Parish Church in Liverpool. It’s been called a chance encounter that changed the course of history.

First US law over AI bias in hiring tools takes force <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93n?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> People stand in front of a giant computer screen with a resume on the screen as other people stand on the side looking inside the computer. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93n?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The hiring manager who decides whether you get your next job may not be human as companies increasingly adopt AI tools for hiring. And a New York City law <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93o?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5706fd52a55a> that took effect yesterday wants to make sure that if the AI doesn’t pick you, it’s not because of an algorithm’s baked-in bias.

The concern is real: AI can exhibit racist and sexist biases (machines, they’re just like us!), and a survey last year by the Society for Human Resource Management found that almost one in four companies already uses AI in the hiring process.

The first-of-its-kind law requires companies to:

Notify job candidates who live in NYC that AI is being used and let them request info on what data is being collected.

Conduct yearly independent audits of any AI tools they use to make employment decisions to ensure they don’t discriminate based on sex, race, or ethnicity and publish ratios to show whether they disproportionately impact certain groups.

Businesses that don’t comply can be fined up to $1,500 per violation a day.

Everyone’s a critic

As with all things AI, the new law drew impassioned responses. It was passed in 2021, but got delayed for years while lawmakers sifted through a boatload of public comments on how to enforce it—many from businesses that called it an impractical burden.

Some public interest groups and advocates now say the final version doesn’t go far enough to root out discrimination. Because it focuses on AI making substantial decisions, it may not even apply to the popular use of software to winnow down job applicants before they’re screened by human staff.

Zoom out: NYC’s law will be the first to regulate bias in AI algorithms in the workplace, but it won’t be the last. And it’ll provide an important model for laws around the country. Legislators in California, New Jersey, Vermont, and New York are already drafting state-level laws.—AR

UPS union contract talks fell apart with a strike on the horizon. America’s largest private-sector package delivery service and the Teamsters Union representing 340,000 of its workers accused each other of walking away from negotiations over pay yesterday. The union plans to go on strike if a deal isn’t reached before the current contract expires on July 31, a move that could hobble supply chains and weigh on the US economy. Rivals like FedEx might benefit from picking up extra business, but they would likely struggle to take on all the 20 million packages that UPS handles daily.

Japan Airlines wants you to never again feel the agony of zipping a bursting-at-the-seams suitcase and lugging it to the airport only to learn that it’s 3.4 pounds overweight.

The airline debuted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93t?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fee85748dd37> its “Any Wear, Anywhere” service yesterday to let passengers rent clothes and receive them upon arrival in Japan.

The country’s flagship carrier wants to study whether the offering will encourage folks to pack light, allowing its planes to burn less greenhouse-gas-spewing fuel. Plus, it’s meant to reduce clothing waste through a partnership with trading firm Sumitomo Corp., which will supply overstock garments.

Here’s how it works:

Travelers assemble their Japan-trip wardrobe online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93u?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=153b78f550b9> by choosing up to eight sets of business or business casual clothes at $28–$49 each.

The outfits are delivered to their hotel, and travelers can keep them for up to two weeks.

Japan Airlines is one of several airlines making moves to give an environmentally friendly sheen to aviation, which causes 3.5% of human-induced climate change, according to one study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93v?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e383aafe7358>.

Cities declare their independence from fireworks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/925?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Miami Beach, Florida, Ocean Terrace, Fire on the Fourth, 4th of July Festival, drone light show featuring Liberty Bell. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/925?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
As smoky skies blanket the East Coast and the West enters another wildfire season, many US cities are beginning to acknowledge that pounding the air with pyrotechnics in the middle of the summer is maybe not the best idea.

Expanding a trend that began in earnest last year, a number of cities—particularly in the West—are scrapping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/926?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f63cae8d145c> their July Fourth fireworks displays in favor of drone shows.

Salt Lake City will hold its first drone show for Independence Day to be “conscientious of both our air quality and the potential for wildfires,” Mayor Erin Mendenhall said.

Boulder, CO, is doing the same, citing “increased fire danger fueled by climate change.”

In California, Lake Tahoe and La Jolla are also opting for drone shows.

Community leaders hope their residents will embrace the change like baseball fans have the pitch clock. Not only are drones safer and better for the environment than fireworks, but they’re also quiet, which is great news for dog owners. Plus, they can tell a story in a way fireworks cannot.

As more events around the world, from the Super Bowl to New Year’s celebrations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/927?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1fdd549b142b>, adopt drone shows, the market for them has grown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/928?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b510cb55f492> from virtually nothing a decade ago to ~$1 billion in 2021, per Allied Market Research data cited by the NYT.

But the pryos aren’t going down without a fight

In fact, fireworks have never been more popular. Americans increased their spending on fireworks by about $100 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/929?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=baeb9f69c18a> this year compared to last summer, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association. If spending reaches $2.3 billion this season, as expected, that would represent a 3x increase from just 11 years ago.

Compared to synchronized drones, fireworks are cheaper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92a?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=06ca2e9527c6>—a small drone show could cost $20,000, while a fireworks display can land under $7,000, per Flying Magazine. Plus, even the coolest drone shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92b?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=00f27b3ebc8d> don’t stir the soul quite like the experience of watching explosives detonate hundreds of feet above you and illuminate the night sky.

Bottom line: As drone choreography goes mainstream and fireworks sales soar even higher, both types of shows will probably coexist on the July Fourth itinerary.—NF

“The Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest is the crucible through which greatness is forged,” George Shea likes to say.

It’s not bluster: Shea is the co-founder and chairman of Major League Eating, the organization that holds about 70 eating competitions throughout the year, including the July Fourth hot dog eating contest in Coney Island.

Shea’s performance as emcee of that contest has turned him into an American legend. Every Fourth of July at Nathan’s Famous, Shea goes viral for his <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92k?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb7ed95ef9b3> intros <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92l?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f5e7e65b908b> that whip a crowd of 35,000 people (and millions more watching at home) into a frenzy to cheer on the most prolific competitive eaters of our time.

Before the dogs hit the stage and the grandstands fill up with viewers hungry for drama, Morning Brew caught up with Shea to discuss what it’s like to witness greatness up close.

Here is a snippet from our interview.

MB: What is it like to watch Joey Chestnut eat up close?

GS: What I feel from Joey is this intense anxiety, focus, and fury. A whole-body tension. It’s like a spring wound way too tight. And it unwinds through the contest. It’s encased fury, but not anger so much as tension and energy. But the real takeaway for me is the dynamic between Joey and the crowd, the energy that comes back to the stage from the crowd is incredible. And so when I think of Joey eating, I’m sort of outside of that loop. But I’m right near that loop. And that loop is incredible.

The riots appear to be abating somewhat, but on Sunday, a Paris-area mayor’s wife and child were injured when a burning car hit their home in the middle of the night. The killing of the teenager, known as Nahel, at a traffic stop unleashed long-simmering frustrations over police mistreatment of French immigrants, particularly those of North African descent.

 ✢ A Note From Facet

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.

Dolphins say gitchy-gitchy-goo, too. We can’t help but turn it up an octave when talking to babies, and it turns out dolphins can’t, either. Bottlenose dolphin moms whistle at a higher tone and with more variation in their pitch when addressing their offspring, marine biologists who studied a group of Florida dolphins for more than three decades have determined. The findings were true for all 19 of the mic’d-up aquatic mothers. Researchers aren’t sure why, but it might be for the same reasons that other species use baby talk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90G?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ceb31309c378>: to catch a kid’s attention and teach them how to pronounce new sounds.

The universe is churning like the ocean. Astronomers are freaking out over a new finding that all but confirms what Einstein predicted in 1916: Outer space is not stagnant; it’s constantly being stretched and rippled by gravitational waves <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90H?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2030167c8a51>. For the first time ever, scientists have detected a long-theorized, low-frequency hum throughout the cosmos that they think emanates from black holes that helped shape galaxies far, far away (and a long, long time ago). The discovery marks “the beginning of a new journey into the universe to unveil some of its unsolved mysteries,” according to Dr. Michael Keith, a member of one of the teams that provided evidence.

Portrait of a pizza that’s actually flatbread. It seemed the history of tomato pies was about to be rewritten when archaeologists found what looked like pizza depicted in a 2,000-year-old painting in Pompeii…until they clarified that the delicious image in question was actually flatbread <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90I?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0b8865b0e95d>. Yes, there is a difference. The painting of a food platter—found on a wall adjacent to a previously buried Pompeii bakery—depicts mensa, a cheese- and tomato-less Roman flatbread that serves as an edible vehicle for other foods. Pizza as we know it wouldn’t have been possible back then since tomatoes didn’t even get to Italy until the 1500s. So, Naples, which sits just 15 miles from the city doomed by Vesuvius’s 79 BCE eruption, gets to keep its claim to fame as the 18th-century birthplace of pizza.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Does the US have a UFO retrieval program? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90q?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Alien spacecraft <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90q?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Coneyl Jay/Getty Images It’s a bird…it’s a plane…it’s…well, we’re actually not quite sure, so Happy World UFO Day!

Today is one of two UFO holidays commemorating the crash and recovery of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 during a frenzy of mysterious aerial disc sightings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91j?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=18e5a4bfb471>. The strange happenings spawned speculation that the government was covering up an alien visit to the town, and some diehard believers refused to drop the idea of little green men even after the Air Force admitted decades later that the “UFOs” were actually its spycraft.

But in recent years, the UFO conversation has moved beyond dubious claims made by the usual suspects <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90s?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4fa89bbfbd3c>. The Pentagon recently said it is studying 800 instances of military and civilian pilots encountering unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), a term used to describe any unexplained airborne specimen.

Then, last month, former military intelligence official David Grusch came forward with claims <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90u?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=880c6cf087a1> that the government has kept lawmakers and the public in the dark about its UAP retrieval program. While Grusch hasn’t talked about witnessing any alien spacecraft himself, he says his work on the ​​Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force gave him access to intel suggesting that:

* The military possesses “intact and partially intact” aircraft of “nonhuman origin,” as well as the remains of extraterrestrial beings.

* UFO crashes are a global phenomenon, and the US government once received a craft from Italy’s Benito Mussolini with the help of Pope Pius XII.

The Pentagon has denied it, but reportedly there have been other insiders who’ve made similar claims, and some of Grusch’s former colleagues vouched that his credibility was out of this world.

The government is looking into it

Grusch has filed a formal whistleblower complaint and submitted some of the classified material to Congress (though he has yet to provide proof to the public). Lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee plan to hold a hearing on the revelations soon.

Not everyone is buying Grusch’s disclosures, but the idea that the truth is out there has some takers on Capitol Hill.

* Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Newsweek he’s treating the claims seriously since they come from people with “high clearances and high positions within our government.”

* “I just believe it in my heart,” Republican Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett said of the possibility that the US has found extraterrestrial aircraft. He says his views on the matter are based on conversations he’s had with military pilots.

* Attending a classified military briefing in March brought Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to a similar conclusion. He said he’d seen evidence of craft that he’s not familiar with the US, its allies, or adversaries possessing.

What does the science say?

Not many scientists are willing to confirm (or debunk) claims that we’ve received visitors from other planets, with most agreeing that more research is needed to find an answer.

Some are plowing ahead with that research. One controversial Harvard astrophysicist started an observatory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90v?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e629b7ea2090> dedicated to using state-of-the-art tech to spot potential extraterrestrial spacecraft. Others are coming up with a system to study UAPs in a scientifically sound way. 

Last fall, NASA put together an interdisciplinary team of 16 scientists to develop a roadmap for UAP studies going forward, which they’ll present to the agency this month.

When asked by Morning Brew what’s missing from the way claims of UAPs are currently investigated, one of the NASA team members, oceanographer Paula Bontempi, quoted Carl Sagan in response: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

The group thinks eyewitness accounts aren’t reliable, and it’s busy developing rigorous methods to evaluate strangeness in the skies. This could involve using crowdsourced data from citizen scientists.

Bontempi said it’s important to combat the stigma associated with talking about UAPs by creating a reporting process that doesn’t make people fear becoming a laughing stock.

What the NASA group can say for now…is that there’s no better way to tackle UAP mysteries than with the scientific method. Another pro tip from the team: Don’t alienate anyone by jumping to premature conclusions.—SK

  Place to be: Nathan’s Famous hot dog stand <#> Nathan's Famous on the Coney Island Boardwalk. Anne Czichos/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

On the Fourth of July, the eyes of the nation will fixate on a tiny peninsula in Brooklyn to watch just how much salt and meat trimmings the human digestive system can handle before it shuts down.

We’re talking, of course, about Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island, a Fourth of July tradition that dates back to 1916.

That year, 24-year-old Jewish immigrant Nathan Handwerker stopped slicing bread at a restaurant to invent the next best thing: a hot dog stand <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90J?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1c16811bcf77> at the corner of Stillwell and Surf Avenues that served up fast, cheap, and savory finger food.

Fast forward to today, and Nathan’s Famous is a publicly traded corporation with franchises all over the world. Not only is the original shop in Coney Island still standing, but it’s a lot bigger and sells a variety of delights (cheeseburgers, lobster rolls, frog’s legs) you can bring with you on a stroll along the boardwalk.

Meanwhile, the hot dog contest held at Nathan’s has ballooned into a full-blown television event: ESPN has owned the broadcasting rights for the past 20 years.

You can even place wagers on it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90K?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2206fffc3dcb>, though don’t expect to make much money if you bet on Joey Chestnut or Miki Sudo to win. These two gastronomically talented athletes dominate the men’s and women’s divisions, and last year Chestnut won by 15 dogs while (expertly) subduing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90L?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=49bb41f27ec6> a protester who rushed the stage during the event.—NF

* “Saw a group smuggle a 24-pack of beer in a baby stroller. It was one of the most elaborate—and impressive—festival cons I’ve seen.”—Amanda from Fort Worth, TX

* “I met someone who plugged an air fryer into an outlet he found in a telephone pole, in which he cooked mini corn dogs and took them to a set to share with the crowd and even gave one to the artist onstage.”—Hailey from Pittsburgh, PA

* “Was at WE Fest, a country music festival in Detroit Lakes, MN, and on the last night, a bunch of kids lit a whole row of port-a-potties on fire .”—Miranda from Fairmont, MN

* "On the second day of the Chickenstock Music Festival in Chicken, AK, they hold a 5k race first thing in the morning. The route goes up a steep road, down the side of a hill, through the woods, and through streams. It’s marked with signs teasing people about being hungover. Also, the festival’s host wears a chicken suit, and they drop Peeps from a bush plane.”—Molly from Eugene, OR

Good morning and welcome to the new month. Today, in addition to being the first day of the second half of the year, is a sacred day for baseball fans: It’s Bobby Bonilla Day.

Every July 1, retired All-Star third baseman Bobby Bonilla receives a $1.19 million check from his former team, the New York Mets, even though he hasn’t played an MLB game in more than 20 years. The reason is that back in 2000, the Mets owed Bonilla $5.9 million, but instead of taking that cash up front, Bonilla worked out a contract that spreads out $30 million in guaranteed payments to him through annual installments from 2011–2035.

And so, July 1 has become an annual celebration of Bonilla’s financial planning and also an opportunity to tease the Mets even more than we already do.

Both landmark decisions were decided by a 6–3 vote along ideological lines in the conservative-majority court.

The high court dropped the rulings on the last day of its term. So, let’s dig into what the justices did before heading off for their summer vacation.

Student debt relief is toast

The Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 student debt for an estimated 43 million eligible borrowers.

SCOTUS ruled that the president needed congressional approval to direct his Education Secretary to cancel so much student debt. It would’ve been one of the priciest executive orders in history, costing the government $400 billion.

It rejected the administration’s argument that its plan was legal under a 2003 law that lets the Department of Education issue student debt relief in a national emergency.

The ruling had no immediate impact on anyone’s bank account because the program had already been halted by an appeals court. But it means that when student loan repayments start up again in October after a three-year pause for Covid, the debt relief many were counting on won’t be coming, ruining the summer Friday mood for millions of college grads struggling with student debt.

The program was popular: 26 million people had already signed up for debt relief and 53% of people polled by Reuters/Ipsos in March supported the plan. But it still had plenty of critics <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91Y?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=de8abc0a66bb> who claimed it could fuel inflation and mostly helped people who were already privileged.

Despite the loss, President Biden vowed to find other ways to ease the burden of American student loan borrowers, who collectively owe $1.77 trillion in education debt, per the Education Data Initiative, saying his administration is already working to enact a different debt relief program under another law.

Free speech trumps anti-discrimination

SCOTUS also decided that Christian graphic designer Lorie Smith, who says she’d like to get into the wedding website business, has the right to refuse to make sites for same-sex couples.

The conservative majority ruled that…

Smith is exempt from a Colorado state law that makes it illegal for businesses to refuse service to clients based on sexual orientation because her profession is a creative one.

Forcing her to make a website with content that she’s opposed to would violate her First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

In their dissent, the liberal justices called the decision “license to discriminate” and said it would have “the immediate, symbolic effect” of giving LGBTQ people second-class status. Advocates worry it could allow bigoted businesses to deny service to other minorities as well.—SK

SCOTUS to consider accused domestic abusers’ gun rights. After dropping two major decisions yesterday, the Supreme Court ensured that all eyes would stay glued to it next term by agreeing to take up a case over whether the government can bar people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91o?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b599fb9ed920>. It’s the first major Second Amendment case the court has agreed to hear since issuing a ruling last year that struck down New York gun restrictions and recognized for the first time a right to carry guns outside the home. It’s expected to clarify the standard that case set, which has led to many new challenges to gun laws.

FTC plans crackdown on fake online reviews.

Fake reviews that deceive consumers have always been forbidden, but the government hasn't done much about it. The new rules would mostly let social media and review sites off the hook and instead target businesses that buy and manipulate reviews. Some estimates say as many as 40% of all online reviews are bogus.

NASCAR to test Chicago’s need for speed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91q?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> NASCAR race car on Chicago bridge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91q?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Patrick McDermott/Getty Images
The air is already filled with smoke and fireworks have been popping off for days, so when NASCAR stages <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91r?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=15cb3b40bce7> its first street race this weekend in downtown Chicago, it should fit right in. On Sunday, 37 drivers will race around the 2.2-mile track of city streets along Lake Michigan in hopes of wooing a new crop of racing fans.

It’s all a big test. Former mayor Lori Lightfoot signed a three-year deal with NASCAR last year hoping to beef up tourism in a downtown area hit hard by the shift to remote work. However,  new mayor Brandon Johnson isn’t quite as sold on revving engines and events featuring $63 six-packs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91s?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cccbe6b00cf2> of Busch Light, so how this weekend’s race plays out will likely determine the future of NASCAR’s partnership with the Windy City.

NASCAR claims its race will bring in $113 million plus generate an additional $3 million in tax revenue for the city.

But some residents say the deal only benefits wealthy visitors, since the event will clog up traffic and tickets range from $269 to over $3,000.

So far, the race is getting lapped: NASCAR is expecting 50,000 fans to attend each day of the weekend, but unlike when Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour made it impossible to book a room, hotels near the track aren’t even close <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91t?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=984818b68273> to being filled up.—MM

G’day, psychedelics: Australians who have struggled to find an effective treatment for their PTSD or depression can now ask their doctor if psilocybin or MDMA may be right for them.

Starting today, psychiatrists Down Under can seek approval to prescribe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91y?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=654edf8416b4> magic mushrooms and ecstasy. It’s the first time a whole country has recognized the psychedelics as medicine (when dosed properly) and offered them nationwide.

But it won’t be an easy trip

A course of special therapy sessions is estimated to cost between $9,900 and $16,600. Still, it seems a tipping point is finally here on hallucinogens’ long, strange trip to mainstream medicine—and not just in Australia.

This year, Oregon became the first US state to let people use mushrooms under professional supervision. Colorado—which just hosted a 12,000-person psychedelics conference featuring Aaron Rodgers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91z?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b9177f8872cf>—has voted to legalize, too.

Lawmakers in California, Connecticut, New York, Washington, Utah, New Jersey, and Missouri are also trying to secure the public’s right to trip.

Psilocybin and MDMA are still federally illegal in the US, but 61% of American voters support therapeutic access, according to a poll conducted by UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, and the FDA released its first draft of guidance on clinical psychedelic trials last month.

Stat: Big Tech might get all the big finance headlines, but there was also another group of stocks making massive gains this year: cruise line operators <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91E?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=45a8d21d5299>. Carnival (up 136% YTD) and Royal Caribbean (up 113%) were among the top five gainers in the S&P 500 for the first half of the year (alongside Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla) as people went back on vacation at sea and they recovered from pandemic lows. All that cruising does have a downside, though. There have been 13 norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships since January—that’s the largest number for a single year since 2012, per the WSJ, and we’re only halfway through.

SCOTUS strikes down affirmative action <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZK?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> UNC Chapel Hill campus <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZK?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Eros Hoagland/Getty Images
The Supreme Court ruled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZL?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c92f6c53ba47> yesterday that colleges cannot consider race in the admissions process, a decision that overturns 40 years of precedent and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for diversity initiatives on campuses and in corporate boardrooms.

In a 6–3 ruling along ideological lines, the majority-conservative court sided with Students for Fair Admissions, the group that filed lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that claimed that the institutions discriminated against white and Asian American students by giving Black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants a boost in admissions considerations.

Following the opinion, which is part of a wave of recent SCOTUS decisions President Biden called “out of sorts with the basic value system of the American people,” Biden urged schools to continue to promote racial diversity. But college admissions officials say that attempts to increase diversity in other ways, like using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race or expanding recruiting efforts geographically, almost always fall short.

Corporate diversity could take a hit, too

Legal experts warn that the Supreme Court’s rollback of affirmative action opens the door for challenges to race-conscious diversity programming in the workplace, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, as well as diversity quotas companies have in place for hiring and promotions.

Experts are recommending that companies swap out their use of the word “diversity” for phrasing like “Title VII compliance” or the title “chief diversity officer” for “chief transformation officer” to avoid potential litigation.

Business leaders and labor lawyers say companies should count on spending time—and money—to prepare for increased legal action launched by critics of diversity policies.

Corporate America might also need to build new pipelines for diverse talent. Last year, nearly 80 US firms including Apple, Meta, and Google filed a brief in support of affirmative action as the policy headed to court, saying that they “depend on university admissions programs that lead to graduates educated in racially and ethnically diverse environments.”

Looking ahead…pencil in another top story about the Supreme Court tomorrow. SCOTUS’s ruling on President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan is expected this morning before they, like the entire workforce in Western Europe, break for summer.—CC

The passengers were three Italians who flew up to a peak altitude of 279,000 feet to enjoy the view and conduct scientific experiments.

Meanwhile, the police officer who killed the teenager known as Nahel M. was arrested on charges of voluntary homicide. French President Emmanuel Macron said the shooting was “inexcusable” but also called the rioting “totally unjustifiable.”

The men are accused of trading shares in Digital World Acquisition Corp. based on nonpublic knowledge and making bank in October 2021 when news it planned to acquire Truth Social made its stock soar.

Aspartame to be named a possible cancer-causer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZT?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Aspartame, one of the most popular artificial sweeteners, is found most diet sodas and many other products. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZT?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Your friend who proudly drinks regular Coke might be insufferable today: Aspartame is set to be labeled as “possibly carcinogenic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZU?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eabbe033e8b6>” next month when the World Health Organization releases two reviews of the popular artificial sweetener, according to Reuters.

The report on aspartame—found not only in most diet sodas but also in teas, chewing gums, yogurts, and Mrs. Butterworth’s sugar-free syrup—is expected on July 14 from the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), alongside a second WHO committee’s new recommendation on dosing, which hasn’t yet been revealed. Until now, it had been widely accepted that someone would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda to be at risk.

But, many items on the WHO’s “possibly carcinogenic” list <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZV?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6d9ba3e3f1cd> are still common in daily life: mobile phones, carpentry, and putting baby powder on your nether regions, to name a few.

The IARC has been criticized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZW?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=40ae2950b1dc> in the past for stirring up confusion when releasing new classifications…like when it added processed meats to the carcinogenic category—the worst one—which inspired a bunch of cold-cuts-is-the-new-smoking headlines.

Big Cola is big mad: Groups representing products containing aspartame are already calling the classification misleading and panicking over how this might sway consumers to change their habits…or potentially sue companies. But Diet Pepsi is sitting pretty because it ditched aspartame in 2020.—ML

Enhanced Games says let them run on ’roids <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z-?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Athlete holding Enhanced Games flag <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z-?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Enhanced Games
Taking an idea that has emerged from many stoner basements, one Australian entrepreneur wants to remake the Olympics, but with drugs. Aron D’Souza has announced the Enhanced Games, a drug-test-free sporting event that aims to reward a new, ’roided up class of athletes—like this anonymous sprinter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z_?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9eb304a1fa30> who claims to have beaten Usain Bolt’s 100m record.

Is this a joke? Nope. D’Souza, the president and founder of Enhanced Games as well as the legal mind behind Peter Thiel’s takedown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8-0?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b97ba84d935e> of media company Gawker, has been hyping up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8-1?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41ce3f61d348> his plans to host the first event in 2024 (no word on location). He also told the Guardian he has two famous athletes on board (no word on which ones) and a bunch of Silicon Valley investors interested (again, no specifics). D’Souza’s event will include five categories: track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, and combat sports.

Enhanced Games says it’s fighting a battle for the soul of sports. The event’s website accuses traditional athletic competitions like the Olympics of being “anti-science” and shaming “enhanced athletes.”

But traditional sports are pushing back. Representatives from the Olympics have spoken out against D’Souza for promoting unhealthy practices. Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll said Monday that the Enhanced Games are “both dangerous and irresponsible.”—MM

Good morning. One of the most frequently asked questions we get from readers is: What determines the order of the Brew writers’ names in this intro section? Despite what you may have speculated, it is not Neal picking favorites like he’s Abby Lee Miller on Dance Moms.

It just represents the order of the authors of the news stories. So in today’s edition, Molly wrote the Shein story, Cassandra tackled air travel, and Matty made a joke about bulk Costco ham. Abby and Neal edited those stories and filled in the rest of the sections. Sorry if that isn’t as exciting as any of your conspiracy theories.

—Molly Liebergall, Cassandra Cassidy, Matty Merritt, Abby Rubenstein, Neal Freyman

Shein’s influencer trip is not beating the sweatshop allegations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T3?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Fashion influencers were invited to tour a Shein model factory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T3?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Shein
Fast-fashion behemoth Shein recently pulled a Willy Wonka and invited a few influencers to tour one of its 6,000 factories. But instead of generating positive PR, the creators who went are getting flamed for promoting what’s being called a propaganda trip.

Despite the brand’s history of alleged environmental harm and human rights abuses, a bunch of videos set to upbeat music show the fashion influencers praising their all-expenses-paid journey to a Shein “model factory” in Guangzhou, China. The clips have incited an online firestorm, including a viral parody <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T4?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=65a1eb116fc6> in which a sustainable fashion supporter pretends to gush over the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.

In a now-deleted video, Dani Carbonari, who’s been especially dragged for calling herself an investigative journalist but sounding like a Facebook uncle, said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T5?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e20a8fe62856>, “The China trip has been one of the most life-changing trips of my life,” and that her “biggest takeaway from this trip is to be an independent thinker, get the facts, and see it with your own two eyes.”

But actual investigative journalists have seen Shein’s inner workings with their own two eyes. A documentary <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T6?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b48f88e4ccc5> released last fall revealed that workers were being paid pennies per clothing item on 18-hour shifts with almost no days off…which makes sense for Shein’s cheap and fast business model. Two dozen members of Congress have asked the SEC to halt the brand’s desired IPO until allegations of forced labor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T7?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f6461e7950c> are investigated.

Zoom out: Brand trips have been a thing since the early days of YouTube vlogging, but the public has soured on the promotional vacations, so they’re becoming riskier for companies. Tarte Cosmetics recently came under fire <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T8?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ab89006f1f9b> for “tone-deaf” displays of luxury on an influencer trip to Dubai, and for reportedly giving creators of color second-class treatment.—ML

Mass flight cancellations put a damper on the 4th <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SW?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Airport departures dashboard with all flights canceled or delayed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SW?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Now may be the time to invest in an Amtrak pass. A combination of thunderstorms and staffing shortages led to more than 20,000 delayed and 5,000 canceled flights <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SX?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2facb91fbc5c> across the country this week.

And as we head into the Fourth of July weekend, with the TSA predicting tomorrow will be the busiest day of air travel since the pandemic began, more chaos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SY?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=dffc1e9c9bdb> is likely still to come.

What’s the problem? The bad weather isn’t helping, and workers remain hard to come by even as travel has come roaring back post-pandemic. Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, which has had the most cancellations, blamed FAA staffing issues, and he’s not alone. An audit of the FAA found:

77% of critical facilities (like Air Traffic Control) are staffed below the 85% level the agency considers necessary.

FAA facilities in New York and Miami are staffed at 54% and 66%, respectively, which “poses a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations,” per the report.

Gone are the days of snagging your grandpa’s Costco card and buying a metric ton of ham on visits home. The retailer said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SM?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1d85bf802763> it’s getting serious about preventing non-members using members’ cards to enjoy the bulk riches.

Technically, it was always against the store’s policy to use someone else’s membership card. But workers at the home of the $1.50 hot dog will now require shoppers using self-checkout to show their IDs. And those IDs had better match the Costco cards.

Why now? The retailer relies heavily on membership fees—which brought in $4.2 billion in 2022—to offset its cheap prices, low margins, and now, inflation. Costco’s profits dipped 4% last quarter despite a 2% increase in revenue.

So if you want to keep buying cheap rotisserie chickens, you’ll have to join the ranks of Costco’s 124.7 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SN?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a136849c7eeb> cardholders. A Gold Star Membership will set you back $60, while an Executive Membership costs $120 and offers some bonuses (like a 2% rebate at the end of the year as well as auto and travel perks).

Stat: If you’re hoping to pivot to a high-paying job, you might want to go back to school—not to level up your skills but to become eligible for an internship <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Tc?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e62f974c90f9> on Wall Street. Interns at Citadel are making a median $120 per hour this summer, a 25% jump from last year, according to Bloomberg. Big banks are also shelling out to nab young talent (Citi’s paying $50 per hour), and offering perks like sign-on bonuses. In what we’re sure is totally unrelated news, recent and soon-to-be college grads polled by the CFA Institute ranked finance as the No. 1 industry they’d like to work in (in 2021, it ranked fifth). Citadel got more than 69,000 applicants for its internship program.

And Mondays? They’re “touch and go,” Roth said. But he doesn’t think you’re going to kill his business by refusing to put pants on—the company is betting that workers will still be willing to schlep into the office on other days, as long as the commute’s not too bad. And it’s betting big, pouring $1.2 billion into revamping office buildings next to Penn Station.

Good morning. There’s only one full-service state standing. Last week, Oregon lawmakers overturned a 72-year-old prohibition on pumping your own gas at gas stations, making New Jersey the only US state that still requires an attendant to fill up your tank.

Oregonians, welcome to the club. You’re about to discover one of the greatest joys in life: stopping the meter right on a round number.

The summer the world turned pink <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8P9?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustrated pink globe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8P9?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
On Monday, Airbnb listed a real-life Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pa?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a35129edb347> hosted by “Ken.” It’s only available for two one-night stays, but if you’re lucky enough to score one of them, it won’t cost you a dime: “Ken’s thing is beach, not math,” according to a press release.

The Dreamhouse rental is yet another viral marketing stunt for the upcoming Barbie movie, which has cemented itself as the cultural event of the summer. A promotional effort that began in the spring with a selfie generator <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/4Jf?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41430c8f8f5e> and a beguiling trailer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pb?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fe4e4295034c> (what exactly is the plot?) has ballooned to include seemingly infinite partnerships and even a themed boat cruise in Boston, proving that Kris Jenner works hard, but Barbie’s marketing team works harder.

In fact, the hype around the movie has inspired a whole new wave of interior design:

It’s leading more adults to decorate their homes in Barbiecore, “a palette made up primarily of hot pink, and similarly bold rosy hues like fuchsia and magenta,” the NYT reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pc?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f54795a527b9>.

According to the Times, searches for “Barbie aesthetic bedroom” on Pinterest jumped 1,135% from May 2022 to May 2023.

The pink fuzz is generating ear-piercing buzz

Mattel is hoping that these Barbie licensing deals will jolt the company from its current slumber: In the first quarter, it suffered an operating loss of $115 million and revenue fell 22% YoY.

Chicago residents most vulnerable from the smoke were urged to spend more time indoors, while all Michiganders received an air quality alert. The smoke from Quebec’s fires has even wafted over the Atlantic Ocean <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pm?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=91f257074f8b> to Portugal, Spain, France, and other European countries—but unlike the haze that Dune-ified NYC a few weeks ago, the smoke in Europe does not present a health risk, since it’s much higher up in the atmosphere.

In his lawsuit, the rapper and business mogul claimed that Diageo under-promoted his liquor brands—Ciroc vodka and DeLeón tequila—while hyping other celebrity spirits brands in its portfolio, such as George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila. Diddy accused Diageo of racial discrimination, claiming the company considered DeLeón a “black brand” to be marketed to “urban” customers. Diageo has denied the allegations but decided their business relationship was irreparable.

An EV startup that was supposed to save an Ohio town from going under…has gone under.

Lordstown Motors, maker of the Endurance electric pickup with in-wheel motors, filed for bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pq?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7c36d9c081a6> yesterday. It’s also suing its largest shareholder, Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, for failing to plug it with promised investments.

But just four years ago, it seemed like Lordstown Motors would be the Batman to its Gotham City: Lordstown, Ohio. In 2019, the company swooped in to buy a recently shuttered GM plant that used to be Lordstown’s largest employer.

The facility was repurposed for producing the Endurance, which Lordstown hoped would beat the likes of Rivian’s R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning as the first electric pickup to hit the road.

Two weeks after longtime host Pat Sajak said he was retiring from Triple Toss-Ups, the iconic game show Wheel of Fortune has found its new vowel seller: Ryan Seacrest.

That was fast. Sony Pictures Television likely didn’t want to flirt with any game show drama after everyone finally forgot about its Jeopardy! host-hunting fiasco <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Px?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=87406476c7d9> following Alex Trebek’s death.

Seacrest is inheriting a Wheel that is still spinning after 48 years on air. At its peak in the 1980s, Wheel of Fortune brought in 40 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Py?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a990b1151f2c> nightly viewers, and while those numbers have dropped off significantly, it still averages about 8.6 million.

From frosted tips to million-dollar gifts: In 2002, Seacrest skyrocketed to fame by interviewing hopeful pop stars and attractive people who were never told they couldn’t sing on American Idol. The man seems to always be juggling about five jobs at a time: Seacrest has hosted New Year’s Eve events, DJ’d radio shows, and gabbed with Kelly Ripa for six years on the morning talk show Live (which he left in April).

But…his new gig may not be such a time commitment. Being a primetime game show host is one of the most enviable jobs in Hollywood because it provides stability, offers mega payouts, and you only work a few days of the month. Meanwhile, Vanna White—who was rumored to be on the successor list—will stay on when Seacrest takes over, but she’s aggressively negotiating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pz?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=07820b5dd2fd> her first pay raise in 18 years, according to Puck.—MM

Good morning. A healthcare mystery may just have been cracked, and the suspect:  Mr. Harold, in the kitchen, with a pickleball racket.

You see, a few weeks ago UnitedHealth Group said more people were using the healthcare system (bad news for insurers), and no one exactly knew what was up, Bloomberg reported.

UBS calculated that the game’s surging popularity—among seniors, in particular—will contribute $377 million in medical costs this year for procedures like hip replacements and knee surgeries.

It makes intuitive sense, but this still reeks of Big Tennis.

Weight-loss drugs are ditching the needle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jk?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Novo Nordisk will ask for FDA approval on a semaglutide pill for weight loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jk?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Just when it seemed the weight-loss drug race couldn’t get any more frenzied, the makers of popular obesity medications said “Hold my syringe.”

Novo Nordisk said yesterday it will seek FDA approval this year for a pill version of its pound-shedding medication, Wegovy (Ozempic for weight loss), after finding that an oral alternative was just as effective as the injectable version.

That leaves Pfizer and Eli Lilly—the maker of Mounjaro <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jl?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f0dec9d4df2d>, a recent breakout in weight loss—trailing a bit behind as the three drugmakers compete <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jm?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0008d0055c8f> for the biggest slice of a fast-growing industry that could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade, analysts estimate. Pfizer’s CEO has estimated that an obesity pill could rake in $10 billion each year for the company that makes it.

In Novo Nordisk’s final trials before FDA review, diabetics lost up to 20 pounds and non-diabetics lost an average of 35 pounds—or 15% of their body weight—on a high-dose daily pill version of semaglutide (the generic name for Ozempic and Wegovy).

Competitor Eli Lilly’s oral weight loss drug, orforlipron, enabled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jn?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fed10366a108> non-diabetic users to lose up to 14.7% of their body weight in phase two studies (one step behind final trials). So far, nothing rivals Eli Lilly’s injectable, Mounjaro, which reduces body weight by 22.5%, on average.

Diabetics who pop the high dose of Pfizer’s pill, danuglipron, shed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jo?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cb683c98c059> an average of 10 pounds, according to mid-phase two trial results. Pfizer was developing a second pill, too, but just dropped it after discovering it could harm people’s livers.

But it’s not all pills and rainbows. Some medical professionals think an oral option for weight loss will help those who get squeamish around needles, but critics worry the ease could put pressure on people who are overweight. There’s no timeline yet on when the semaglutide pill form will hit the market, which is still suffering from demand-fueled shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic injectables.—ML

Saudi Arabia plans to lure tourists with luxury resorts and a built-from-scratch city, but it’s already the host of the world’s largest pilgrimage. The biggest Hajj since pre-pandemic times commenced yesterday, with 2 million Muslims from all corners of the world headed to the ancient city of Mecca.

But visiting Islam’s holiest site is unusually pricey this year, as rampant inflation strains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jw?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=69effec14177> worshipers’ wallets. It’s typical for folks to spend years saving up for the sacred journey, which is obligatory for every devout Muslim whose health and finances allow it.

That second caveat is all the more relevant these days:

The most budget-friendly Hajj tour option from Egypt costs ~$5,663, almost double <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jx?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c22781690d26> what it cost in local currency last year, according to the Associated Press.

One Palestinian pilgrim told Reuters he’s traveling by land and staying in a shared hotel room for $7,000, a price that would’ve covered airfare last year.

For the first time ever, fewer than the maximum permitted number of travelers from Bangladesh and Pakistan will make the trip because of its sky-high price tag.

Zoom out: Even though it’s mostly oil money that gives Saudi the cash to do things like buy golf, its economy counts on the Hajj and the year-round Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca to generate $12 billion in revenue annually, per pre-pandemic estimates.—SK

For Tigers: The LSU Tigers clinched the Men’s College World Series title yesterday, defeating the Florida Gators in their second championship of the week. The first, of course, went to LSU fans for consuming the most Jell-O shots at Rocco’s Pizza & Cantina.

Meet the College World Series of Jell-O Shots. What started in 2019 at an Omaha bar across from the baseball field as a goofy way to keep track of how many Jell-O shots fans consumed has morphed into a monster event of its own, with a Twitter account, a business partnership, and donations to charity:

LSU got a big boost from rounds of several thousand shots from alums looking to break records.

In order to get ready for this jelly, Rocco’s teamed up with Jevo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8JW?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa132da3db60>, whose machines can make 100 Jell-O shots every four minutes.

Part of the profits go to food banks at each participating university, and an Omaha food pantry.

Stat: As of last year, 73% of US adults had ditched their landlines and were living the cell-only lifestyle—three times as many as in 2010, according to a Washington Post analysis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8JB?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f59a5593105> of the National Health Interview Survey. As anyone who still calls their parents’ home phone could probably guess, the households where landlines outnumber those with just mobile phones are people 65 and older. Landline havers are also most likely to be located in the Northeast, likely because Verizon is the main provider in the region, meaning many households switched to faster internet earlier, when having a landline was still in vogue, and aren’t bothering to drop it from their package now.

“This coup could have been an email,” one Twitter user quipped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DJ?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=23fc0ffaa091>. And while it was shorter than a test cricket match, the mutiny will leave a long-term stain on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule, exposing him to threats he had never faced before in more than 20 years leading Russia.

The tl;dr (too long; didn’t revolt)

On Friday, the businessman who leads the Wagner private army for Russia, Yevgeny Prigozhin, dramatically escalated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DK?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a6bbeae992d9> his long-simmering feud with the country’s military leadership, posting messages on Telegram that accused Russia’s defense minister of bombing his troops. He announced a “march for justice” against the Russian defense system.

As Prigozhin and his Wagner army marched toward Moscow, Russia charged him with mounting an open rebellion. Bizarre scenes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DL?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=43eeac81ad94> of everyday life comingling with an armed revolt in the major Russian city of Rostov-on-Don spread across social media.

Leaders in Ukraine and the West, unsure of which thug (Prigozhin or Putin) they’d rather have in control of Russia’s stacked nuclear arsenal, looked on and grabbed the popcorn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DM?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7120ce08f14>.

After being on the cusp of civil war on Saturday, the two sides agreed to a truce that would send Prigozhin to Belarus in exchange for amnesty, and Wagner troops would stand down from their march on Moscow.

Who is Prigozhin and what is the Wagner Group? Nicknamed “Putin’s chef,” Prigozhin is a one-time catering tycoon who founded the Wagner Group, a network of soldiers-for-hire that Russia has used to expand its influence in places like Syria and Africa through ruthless tactics. In the current war, Russia has relied heavily on Wagner’s mercenaries to fight against Ukraine.

Authorities said the worst-case scenario (sodium hydro sulfate leaking into the river) was averted but that cars carrying asphalt and molten sulfur had been “compromised,” so they’re testing the water quality. The collapse also severed the main fiber-optic cable that runs through Montana, hampering internet access for Global Net customers.

Is having a fruit on your license plate the new Sports Illustrated cover jinx?

Florida (oranges) and Georgia (peaches) are both experiencing the lowest production of their big-name fruits in decades, which could drive prices for products like OJ even higher than they are now.

Let’s start in Florida, where the citrus harvest this season could be its smallest since 1928 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DY?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6911c072ae5b>: 18 million boxes, compared to a peak of 250 million boxes in the ’90s and early 2000s, according to the Washington Post. Nasty weather in the fall and winter compounded longer-term challenges like greening disease to devastate Florida’s famous citrus groves. And if you do get your hands on fresh-squeezed Florida orange juice, don’t expect it to be the religious experience you’re used to: Orange trees affected with greening disease (which is virtually all of them) produce more bitter fruit.

Moving to the other side of the Florida–Georgia line…country singers might have to find a new simile for “sweet” because Georgia peaches have been almost completely wiped out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DZ?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=be5dfe0b9833> this year. Warm winter weather followed by a cold snap in March have destroyed 95% of the crop, which farmers say is the worst harvest since 1955.

Bottom line: Florida is far more dependent on its citrus harvest than Georgia is on its peaches. In Florida, the citrus industry is worth $6.9 billion, per the University of Florida, while peaches are mostly symbolic for Georgia: They brought in $34 million in revenue <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8D-?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a084f31f1a9c> last year, compared to $1.4 billion for cotton.

What’s going on in Toronto? The previous mayor of North America’s fourth-largest city resigned following a scandal, leaving a leadership void to tackle Toronto’s mounting problems, including skyrocketing housing prices and quality-of-life issues. And getting your name on the Toronto mayoral ballot is easy: All you need to do is pay $189 and get 25 signatures.

Roe v. Wade reversal: 1 year later <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CX?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Abortion protestors in front of the Supreme Court. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CX?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
A year ago today, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and erased the nearly 50-year-old federal protection for abortion access. And even with a leaked draft alerting the country of the decision a month before it came down, how exactly abortion access would change around the country was still an open question.

But a year in, here’s where we’re at:

Restrictions started immediately…25 states have passed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CY?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a0cd7c6d2b08> some form of new abortion restrictions in the past year. And of those, 13 states have passed near-total or total abortion bans, some with no exceptions for rape or incest.

On the flip side…20 states have passed laws protecting abortion rights. But being a safe haven for abortion seekers can come with its own challenges. Planned Parenthood of Illinois saw a 54% spike in patients over the last year, and one clinic in Kansas City has received so many out-of-state patients that it’s only able to help 10%–15% of people seeking abortions.

If it feels hard to keep track of what’s legal where, it’s because it is. So far this year, 700 bills (about half aiming to restrict abortion and half hoping to protect it) have been introduced in state legislatures, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

What’s next? Possibly another major SCOTUS ruling: The battle over mifepristone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CZ?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12b2705a227f>, a common pill used in medication abortions, is currently making its way through the courts and will likely end up with SCOTUS, along with a few other abortion-related cases.

A Gallup poll from last week shows public support for first trimester abortion has never been higher, reaching 69%, and when new restrictions have been part of ballot initiatives, residents of states they’ve been shot down—even in Republican-controlled states like Kansas and Kentucky. So, you can expect Democrats to make it a key issue in the 2024 election.

Top generals accused Prigozhin of trying to mount a coup, and Russian security services were placed on alert. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin published biting criticism of Russia’s military leadership and said Vladimir Putin was deceived into invading Ukraine. The public infighting is considered a threat to Putin’s power.

Starbucks baristas at more than 150 stores plan to take a break from spelling people’s names wrong to protest recent incidents where managers allegedly banned rainbow flags and other Pride decorations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8D3?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6c5fc9badfd5>.

The strike kicked off yesterday at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle and over the next week 3,500 fellow unionized workers are expected to join in.

This is about LGBTQIA+ representation and better working conditions: Some of the participating locations didn’t have any Pride decor issues—they’re protesting in solidarity and to put pressure on Starbucks for better worker pay and benefits. Since the first location voted to unionize in late 2021, Starbucks has fought hard against the union, which now claims the company has stalled their already lengthy contract negotiations by refusing to bargain remotely via Zoom.

Okay, perhaps not that shallow…but a historic drought <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Db?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0794d7c37dc> has been emptying the vital trade waterway since January, and the Panama Canal Authority says El Niño could exacerbate the situation. The lack of rainfall has forced the canal operator to further lower the maximum depth of ships allowed through, threatening to snarl international commerce.

Starting tomorrow, ships with hulls extending further than 43.5 feet below the water’s surface will be forced to shed some kilos to pass.

The limit has been incrementally lowered from the usual 50 feet in order to avert another Suez Canal debacle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Dc?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e32ddb5f667f> when one grounded ship blocked $10 billion worth of daily trade.

The restriction could slow traffic through the busy connector of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which services 3.5% of global trade, according to Quartz. The canal is a major throughway for international container shipments and especially for US liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Asia. Some cargo might have to be dispersed across multiple vessels, potentially creating traffic jams.

The search for the Titanic tourist sub is over <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zc?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Five died in the OceanGate Titan disaster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zc?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Handout/Getty Images
The marine mystery that captivated the world this week had a tragic conclusion: Authorities confirmed yesterday that they found broken pieces of the OceanGate Titan submersible near the Titanic wreckage it was en route to explore, meaning its five passengers are dead.

They are: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, British explorer Hamish Harding, Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, and his son, Suleman Dawood (who, according to his aunt, was “terrified <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2bda887bac1e>” of the trip but ultimately went to please his dad for Father's Day).

The details: A “catastrophic implosion” of the Titan vessel left a field of debris that was found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zd?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1d48be6509cc> on the North Atlantic floor yesterday afternoon, 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic, US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said at a press conference.

When asked about the possibility of recovering the passengers’ bodies, Mauger implied there may not be anything left to find: “This is an incredibly unforgiving environment down there on the seafloor.”

What does this disaster mean for extreme tourism?

Wealthy adventurers might think twice before paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to risk their lives visiting the treacherous, less-explored parts of the world.

The adventure tourism <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ze?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e8f866c76d4> industry was expected to skyrocket from $322 billion in 2022 to more than $1 trillion in 2023, according to Grand View Research.

Popular destinations for extreme tourists are the Titanic, Mount Everest, the South Pole, and a favorite frontier for billionaires: space.

Twelve people have already died this year trying to climb Everest, and five are still missing, adding fuel to critics’ calls for the adventure industry to receive more government oversight.

Years ago, experts sounded the alarm. In a 2018 letter to OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, the Marine Technology Society said Titan was not up to certain safety standards, risking “serious consequences for everyone in the industry.” The next year, Rush told Smithsonian magazine that the commercial sub industry, which hadn’t had a serious incident since 1960, was so “obscenely safe” that it hadn’t “innovated or grown.”

Titanic director James Cameron echoed the safety concerns. Yesterday, he said he was “struck by the similarity of the Titanic disaster itself, where the captain was repeatedly warned about ice ahead of his ship and yet he steamed at full speed into an ice field.” —ML

3M reaches major settlement over “forever chemicals” claims: The manufacturing giant agreed to pay $10.3 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zn?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=52d18509ab87> to settle a barrage of allegations from US cities and towns that it contaminated their drinking water with chemicals known as PFAS. For decades, 3M has used these chemicals (which are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they refuse to break down in the environment or the human body) in products such as firefighting foam, but hundreds of cities sued it for polluting their water and soil. If the settlement is approved, the money will go toward helping these cities clean up their water.

Disposable vapes are booming. You’ve seen them inhaled at parties, discarded on city sidewalks, and sold in strip malls: Refillable e-cigarettes are taking over the US vape market.

The rise of disposables shows how the government’s vaping crackdown is like playing whack-a-mole—the FDA snuffed out refillable brands such as Juul and Vuse in 2020, but a new crop of vapable plastic has emerged to take their place. Overall, US e-cig sales grew 47% in the period analyzed.

The world just can’t ditch inflation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Gold star with "you tried" sticker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Like your younger sister, inflation will just not take the hint and get lost. And so, as they’ve done for more than a year now, central bankers around the globe are hiking interest rates even more to stamp out inflation once and for all.

Yesterday, the Bank of England shocked markets by jacking up interest rates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zm?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c98fadda3e8c> by half a percentage point to their highest level in 15 years. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and Norway have all announced rate hikes in the last few weeks.

Even Turkey, which over the past two years has lowered interest rates to combat inflation (a bonehead move, economists say), went back to Econ 101 and raised interest rates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ym?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=82fb60824e84> by 6.5% yesterday.

It’s probably gonna happen here, too. Although the Fed decided to pause rate hikes last week, Chair Jerome Powell said on Capitol Hill yesterday that Americans should expect one or two more <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yn?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c5eb9dfd642> increases this year. Because, while buying eggs and gas doesn’t hurt quite as much as it used to, the prices of many consumer goods and services are still rising uncomfortably fast. The Consumer Price Index, a broad measure of inflation, rose 4% in May, double the Fed’s 2% goal.

Bottom line: Central banks are all of us trying to slightly turn up the AC in our parents’ house without causing chaos (i.e., a recession). But the longer inflation sticks around, the harder that gets.—MM

Victor Wembanyama is officially a San Antonio Spur after being selected No. 1 overall <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zv?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a0859202381c> in the NBA draft last night. The (possibly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zp?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=951f4353cd40>) 7-foot-4 French phenom joins a group of international players that is dominating the US-based league and fueling its influence overseas.

Wembanyama, who’s been called the greatest NBA prospect since LeBron James, catapulted to basketball fame as a teenager because he manages to be an extremely coordinated person while also being an extremely tall one. His size enables him to play killer defense (dude can block a shot just by standing up), but he can also dribble and shoot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zq?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8cfe083f63fe>—skills typically reserved for shorter players, and certainly not those with an eight-foot wingspan.

The growing presence of international stars in the NBA is hard to miss. As American legends like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry get older, the NBA is becoming a magnet for foreign talent—and taking its product to the source.

The last five MVP awards were given to three international players: Joel Embiid (Cameroon), recent NBA champ Nikola Jokić (Serbia), and Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece and Nigeria).

The NBA staged a buzzy game in Paris earlier this year, and the league and the French government are planning to deepen ties ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games (hosted in...Paris).

What’s with the Euro takeover? Wembanyama, who started playing professional basketball in France when he was 15, argues that the European system of going pro early instead of playing college ball like in the US better prepares players for the demands of the NBA: “We play at a higher level than American prospects in better competitions,” he said earlier this week.—CC

Stat: Americans gave just 1.7% of their personal disposable income to charity last year, which is the lowest share <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yA?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6d4ce717f4c9> since 1995, according to a new Giving USA report. You can chalk that up to economic uncertainty, inflation, and the fact that individuals feel like they’re making less of an impact than bigger philanthropists, per Axios. Speaking of bigger philanthropists, Warren Buffett just donated another $4.6 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yB?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d2868cf8b49f> of Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charities, bringing his total giving to over $51 billion.

Wait a sec…regular napping makes your brain larger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yD?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=777c4ca7e2ea>? How is this not the biggest headline in the world? That’s the conclusion reached by a new study that compared people age 40–69 who were genetically predisposed to take naps vs. people who weren’t, and the researchers found that the nappers—through their naps—had bigger brains that were equivalent to people 2.6–6.5 years younger. The study does have limitations, such as finding that napping has no effect on three other brain measures. But it does apparently preserve brain volume.

**Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Facet Wealth, Inc.

Good morning. The Women’s World Cup is less than one month away, and the two-time defending champ, the USA, is looking to make history: No country’s team, men’s or women’s, has won the World Cup back-to-back-to-back.

The quest to break the record began for real yesterday when the US released its 23-player roster. It’s heavy on newbies—14 players will be making their World Cup debut, joining vets like Alex Morgan, Julie Ertz, and Megan Rapinoe.

So, get very hype, but also be aware that many games will be on at odd hours (like, 3am ET) since the tournament is being held in Australia and New Zealand. Surprisingly, some US cities are not being total squares about it: Washington, DC, just approved a proposal allowing restaurants and bars to remain open 24/7 during the World Cup.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the US on Tuesday, and tonight he’ll be feted at a state dinner <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ue?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=efcee52fc0ba>—making him only the third world leader to get one during Joe Biden’s presidency. While we don’t know whether the guest of honor will enjoy the saffron-infused risotto, we do know what he’ll be talking about in between bites: deepening economic ties.

One major topic will be a guest not invited: China. With US–China relations fraught, American companies are looking to diversify their manufacturing base, and India has been seizing the opportunity that provides.

India and the US are already plenty economically intertwined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uf?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=97ea73311b38>—especially in the tech sector:

Apple has shifted some iPhone production from China to India, and CEO Tim Cook attended the opening of the nation’s first Apple store in April.

About half of IBM’s workforce is located in India, according to Axios.

Around 60 Fortune 500 companies are run by CEOs of Indian origin, including Google and Adobe.

And with CEOs from Apple, Microsoft, FedEx, and Marriott among the anticipated guests at tonight’s gala, per CNBC, the relationship will only get stronger. New deals are expected to be announced during Modi’s stay, and he’s hoping to return home with:

A promise from Tesla. The prime minister met with self-proclaimed Modi “fan” Elon Musk on Tuesday, and Musk said Modi pushed for “significant investments” in India—which Musk said he intends to make. The Tesla CEO said the company will be in India “as soon as humanly possible.”

Permission to manufacture military jet engines. It’s been in the works for a while, but the Biden administration will probably officially authorize General Electric to make F414 engines in India, a necessary step since defense technology is heavily regulated.

There's a catch: Both the US and India want to counter China’s economic might, but there are concerns about Modi’s record on human rights: He has cracked down on dissent and free speech and helped sow religious discord.—AR

Search widens, time narrows for missing Titanic sub. If the Titan, the submersible that went missing Sunday with five people on board as it journeyed toward the wreckage of the Titanic, is not found by around 6am today, there is little hope of there being survivors due to a lack of oxygen. However, as of yesterday, the Coast Guard said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mZ?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f33f1c873f7> it was still a search-and-rescue mission, and more ships were sent out to search an area twice the size of Connecticut.

It noted that Singer subsequently had cases before the high court, including one his firm won concerning billions of dollars in debt repayments from Argentina. Alito took the unusual step of defending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8v7?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ec437b39289> himself in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published first, saying he had “no obligation” to recuse himself and wasn’t even aware Singer was involved in the case.

Bad US accounting is good for Ukraine. After discovering a major error in its accounting, the Pentagon realized it could send another $6.2 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine—without having to ask Congress for more aid cash. The oopsie that the Pentagon described to the Washington Post as “valuation errors” first came to light last month, but then it was considered only $3 billion because the Pentagon got the math wrong…again. The news comes as Ukraine needs to gear up for its counteroffensive to win back territory seized by Russia since the invasion.

Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Amazon Prime’s user design.

The FTC certainly thinks you have. Yesterday, the agency filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uk?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a2cfec89ef2> a lawsuit alleging that Amazon violated consumer protection laws by manipulating millions of customers into signing up—and staying signed up—for its $139-a-year Prime service. The lawsuit claims Amazon did this by:

Making it harder for customers to buy products without a Prime membership.

Utilizing “dark patterns,” a design tactic that subtly convinces users to perform a specific action, to get people to enroll in Prime without their consent.

Designing a cancellation process that took six clicks, which was referred to internally as the “Iliad Flow,” a reference to Homer’s doorstop epic poem.

The lawsuit accused Amazon leadership of being complicit in the company “tricking and trapping” customers, saying that they “slowed or rejected changes that would’ve made it easier for users to cancel Prime because those changes adversely affected Amazon’s bottom line.”

It’s not just Amazon: The FTC proposed rule changes in March that would require companies to make canceling a subscription as easy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ul?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=01e25652d9c8> as signing up for one.

Some diners will soon be able to skip the egg and get straight to the chicken: Two Bay Area-based startups received the go-ahead yesterday from the US Department of Agriculture to sell lab-grown poultry to American consumers for the first time.

The scientist-made meat will initially only be available in two swanky restaurants (one in San Francisco and one in Washington, DC), but the startups, Good Meat and Upside Foods, plan to roll it out to grocery stores eventually.

Supporters of slaughter-free “cultured <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uq?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7478d418ade>” meat—which grows from a sample of an animal’s cells—say this is a big step toward a more humane and environmentally friendly meat industry.  But the challenge of scaling production could keep cultured meat a novelty for those who can afford it.

Upside <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ur?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=abd3243e4f70> hopes to expand production to 400,000 pounds of cultured meat per year. According to poultry industry experts Watt Global Media, Tyson, America’s largest poultry producer, churns out about 200 million pounds…per week.

The startups haven’t revealed the price for their lab-grown chicken cutlets, but they’re expected to eventually cost $20 per pound, rivaling the cost of high-quality organic chicken.

Zoom out: It’ll be years before lab-grown chicken makes it to grocery store shelves, but in that time, scientist-made pork, lamb, fish, and beef could also get approved—150 companies worldwide are looking to grow their own meat and have already raised $3 billion.—ML

A battle of the tech billionaires is brewing: After Elon Musk tweeted that he’d be “up for a cage match” against Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg, the newly ripped Zuck agreed to take him up on the offer via Instagram. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that Zuck’s reply was not a joke. The rivalry stems from Meta’s efforts to build a Twitter competitor, which prompted Musk, who runs five companies, to tweet measured and mature responses like “Zuck my .” If the tech titans have it out, our money’s on recent jujitsu tournament winner Zuck, even if Musk is pretty scrappy.

Good morning. Today is the first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, or as Neil deGrasse Tyson would call it, the summer solstice. You might think, “If today is the solstice…then what the heck is an equinox?” Here’s a cheat sheet:

A solstice occurs when one of the Earth’s poles (today, it’s the north) tilts toward the sun at the maximum angle. The two solstices, in December and June, mark the beginning of winter and summer and give us the longest days and nights of the year.

Equinoxes are essentially the opposite of solstices. Deriving from the Latin for “equal night,” the equinox is when the sun is directly over the equator, leading to roughly the same amount of day and night. Spring and fall begin on equinoxes.

Hope you enjoyed your ride on the Magic School Bus. Let’s get to the news.

Time is running out to find missing submersible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mg?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> OceanGate Titan submersible underwater <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mg?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> OceanGate/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images
A desperate search-and-rescue mission has escalated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mh?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a550609fa6d3> to find Titan, the OceanGate tourist submersible that disappeared Sunday while diving toward the Titanic wreckage. Yesterday afternoon, the US Coast Guard estimated that Titan had fewer than 40 hours of oxygen remaining to sustain life.

We don’t know how Titan got into this situation, but potential explanations include that Titan is floating on the ocean surface after suffering a communication outage (best-case scenario), got tangled in the Titanic wreckage, or suffered a disastrous hull breach (worst-case scenario).

The five people on board include the CEO of OceanGate, a father-son duo from a wealthy Pakistani family, a British billionaire explorer, and a Titanic expert who has led six expeditions to the wreckage. They are deadbolted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mi?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=91a917d5571a> inside by at least 17 bolts, according to a reporter who previously took this trip, and can’t get out unless they’re rescued.

Rescue ops face a time and resource crunch

The US Coast Guard had searched 10,000 square miles of ocean as of yesterday morning, but poor visibility and bad weather have presented additional challenges to a mission that one expert told the BBC is “like searching for a mine in a minefield.”

In an attempt to locate the vessel, rescuers have dispatched aircraft in case Titan surfaces and sonar buoys, which can detect moving objects underwater.

But finding the van-sized watercraft before the oxygen runs out will likely depend on using a remote-operated vehicle, or ROV, which is one of only a few vessels capable of salvaging material at depths of 20,000 feet. The problem is that the Titanic wreckage sits 370 miles from the coast of Newfoundland, and the ships that carry ROVs move at ~20mph, according to the New York Times.

Big picture: OceanGate’s Titanic voyages are a part of the growing “extreme tourism” industry that ferries the uber-wealthy to rarely explored places miles above—and below—sea level. But these trips aren’t guaranteed to end with a champagne shower <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mj?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa7ae6613c22> from Richard Branson, and the potential disaster aboard Titan highlights the elevated risks associated with this kind of travel.

As part of the agreement, Biden will admit that he failed to pay more than $100,000 in taxes on his income of at least $1.5 million in 2017–2018. This deal will likely allow Biden to avoid jail time, but Republicans in Congress have promised to continue their probes into his business dealings.

If your neighborhood reeks of sawdust, it’s because the number of homebuilding projects started rose <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mu?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=16665a7f7c63> 21.7% in May from the prior month to the highest level in more than a year, according to the US Census Bureau.

The dramatic spike in home groundbreakings shocked analysts, and it’s great news for a country in desperate need of more pads. The US has 3.8 million fewer houses than it needs, per Freddie Mac.

What’s behind the shortage? The pace of homebuilding has still not fully recovered from the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008. Meanwhile, recent interest rate hikes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mv?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=38932629ed98> have made homeowners reluctant to sell (since a mortgage for a new property would be more expensive), contributing to the supply crunch.

But your housing shortage is homebuilders’ opportunity:

And homebuilder confidence has risen for six months straight, per a survey from the National Association of Home Builders.

Schneider National, looking to hire drivers, has placed in-game billboard ads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mB?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=45a4906e98ea> on American Truck Simulator, a popular video game that lets players load, drive, and park 18-wheelers in excruciating detail. The game penalizes you when you break road rules and even simulates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mC?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=851b1bee422f> different types of transmissions, per the Washington Post.

The ads show how desperate the trucking industry is to recruit new talent. US trucking companies were short a record 80,000 drivers in 2021, and that number could reach 160,000 by 2030, according to the American Trucking Association.

While in-game ads usually get roasted by gamers, the reaction to the recruitment drive from virtual truckers has been generally positive. One gamer tweeted, “This doesn’t annoy people,” which is about as cheery as gamers can get.

Using video games for recruitment isn’t new. For two decades, the US military published a free, first-person shooter game, America’s Army, to reach future soldiers before shutting it down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mD?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7a23d5b37998> last year. An MIT study in 2008 found that the game was the Army’s most positively impactful advertising tool at the time.—MM

You don’t often hear “US infrastructure” and “shockingly good news” paired together in the same sentence, but Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Saturday that the recently collapsed section of I-95 in Philly will reopen within two weeks—way ahead of schedule.

The lesson: It may take the US 30 years to build a new train line, but never get between Americans and their cars.

Bold immigration experiment boosts Canada’s population <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i-?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Canada immigration application <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i-?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Manjurul/Getty Images
Canada’s people-to-maple-tree ratio is getting bigger, as its population recently became 40 million strong.

The land of making New England winters look like a tropical paradise reached <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i_?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c3a215c07a67> the demographic milestone mostly by politely telling foreign workers, students, and refugee to come on in.

The government has set an ambitious goal of adding 500,000 new permanent residents a year by 2025 as part of its strategy to keep Canada young. While many other high-income economies struggle with an aging native-born population and a shrinking workforce, Canada hopes that newcomers will step up to care for its elderly, invent new tech, and cook up Timbits.

Over a million foreign arrivals that Canada welcomed in 2022 accounted for 96% of its headcount growth last year, according to Statistics Canada.

That puts its population growth rate at 2.7%, making it the fastest growing high-income economy in the world, per Bloomberg.

The country prioritizes admitting the most employable folks by taking into account potential immigrants’ age, language skills, and education. But some say that adapting to the influx of people is not as simple as laying out a giant “welcome/bienvenue” mat.

There are concerns that Canada’s housing supply and infrastructure are struggling to accommodate so many new residents. Skeptics point to surging home prices in large cities as evidence that the immigration ramp-up is straining resources.

The planned purchase surpasses the previous record for an aircraft deal, set by Air India for 470 planes earlier this year, and will more than double IndiGo’s fleet, which currently stands at 300. That this is the second record-breaking aviation deal by an Indian airline in six months is no coincidence—the country is gearing up for a spike in air travel demand due to immense population growth and sustained interest in travel post-pandemic.

Hotez said he won’t debate science but is willing to come on the show alone. Still, he claimed the online attention caused a pair of anti-vaccine activists to show up at his house.

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.

Life is possible on one of Saturn’s moons. Scientists have found all the ingredients needed to support life in an extraterrestrial ocean for the first time, indicating that the waters of one of Saturn’s small moons, Enceladus, are habitable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hI?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0f7a9fe7d376>. While this doesn’t mean that there are little sea creatures living there, the presence of phosphorus—which scientists say is the rarest bioessential element in the universe—suggests there definitely could be. A NASA mission to land on Enceladus and search for life has been tentatively proposed for 2050, so we won’t get answers soon.

🪰 A fly’s lifespan shortens after seeing dead flies. Fruit flies become more antisocial and die faster after seeing or smelling their dead, and the scientists who discovered this say it could also help us understand how people react to being around dead bodies. Similar reactions to being around the dead have been found in other insects and mammals, which suggests that all species might have a connection between their sensory perceptions and life spans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hJ?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bacde5f10960>, according to researchers. They think the fruit fly’s reaction could be an evolutionary adaptation to being in a stressful situation.

Extra confidence makes hot people earn more. It’s already been established that attractiveness tends to trigger preferential treatment, but new research suggests that excessive self-confidence may cause hot people <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hK?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=20f37c18dd16> in finance to get more promotions and money than their normal-looking colleagues. “Due to their great bargaining power, attractive individuals may have learned that they deserve better,” writes one researcher. But the “halo effect” that gives beautiful people better treatment also considers personality: In another study, photos of good-hearted folks got rated as more attractive once participants knew they were looking at kind people.—ML

  Can congestion pricing curb NYC traffic? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York traffic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Alexander Spatari/Getty Images New Yorkers know the rules: Skip the small talk, limit the grocery run to what you can haul to a sixth-floor walk-up, and avoid getting behind the wheel in the city at all costs.

In fact, the costs of driving are only getting higher: NYC is getting closer to charging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hM?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=da40a3e27f9d> people for driving downtown in an attempt to curb rush-hour traffic.

Known as congestion pricing, the fee is meant to encourage commuters to ditch their cars for the train or bus while raising cash to improve public transit.

After a public review period ended Monday, the city is waiting for the final go-ahead from federal authorities to roll out the first congestion charge in a US city as early as next spring. And, as they say, if congestion pricing can make it here, it...will probably spread to other US cities looking to smother traffic and boost revenue.

The policy has helped unclog roads in places like London, Stockholm, and Singapore, and transit wonks in the US are eager to see whether it will catch on here. But, as with anything else, New Yorkers have strong opinions—many of them negative. So, let’s break it down.

Here’s how this would work

* Cars driving into Manhattan anywhere below 60th Street (the area dubbed the central business district) would face a daily toll.

* The exact amount isn’t known yet, but it could be anywhere from $9 to $23 per day for passenger cars, with a reduced fee in off times and a possible discount for low-income drivers.

The MTA expects the congestion charge to reduce the number of cars on the road by up to 20%. And the move is expected to make Manhattan’s air cleaner and its streets safer.

Meanwhile, the fees would raise $1 billion a year, according to the NYC comptroller, and the MTA could use the money to improve service for its trains and buses. With the country’s largest transit system struggling to make ends meet, the fee touted as a win-win.

But is the toll too steep?

Many people are upset about paying to endure Manhattan’s gridlock (even if congestion pricing will raise the average rush-hour speed, which is currently about 7 mph). Some critics say it could hurt low-income drivers, while others worry about potential losses for businesses in the central business district that rely on commercial vehicles.

Outer borough residents aren’t thrilled, either. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican from New York who represents Staten Island, called it a “cash grab” by the MTA and expressed concern that drivers would bypass the tolls by driving through the borough. The MTA acknowledges that the pricing scheme will likely cause more congestion in other parts of town and pollution (the agency has proposed pollution mitigation strategies).

But non-city dwellers might be the least chill with New York’s plan: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lashed out at the measure this week, saying it amounts to a tax on NJ residents who already pay tolls to drive into Manhattan for work.

Pushback to the pushback

“Congestion pricing will not make the sky fall,” Nicholas J. Klein, assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, told Morning Brew, since most people already travel into the area via public transit, walking, or biking.

Associate Professor of Urban Planning at UCLA Michael Manville noted that most people traveling to Manhattan by car can afford the extra charge as they’re already willing to shell out a fortune for parking. And he emphasizes that those who will pay the congestion toll will benefit from a zippier commute.

  Place to be: The (beachy) birthplace of Juneteenth <#> Flying over Galveston Texas Sea Wall and Beach Erico Overton/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Tomorrow, Americans around the country will attend festivals, host backyard barbecues, and parade through the streets to celebrate Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US.

But to understand how Juneteenth began, you have to go to one place: Galveston, TX <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hY?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=78f8aadd9002>.

In this historic port city on the Gulf of Mexico, a Union general informed enslaved Black people in Texas that they were free. The date: June 19, 1865, nearly two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued (information took a while to travel during the Civil War).

Juneteenth only became a federal holiday in 2021, but it’s been celebrated in Galveston for more than 150 years. It’s especially personal for many Black residents of the city, since they can trace their lineage back to the enslaved people who were freed on the original Juneteenth.

As the birthplace of Juneteenth, Galveston offers many opportunities <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hZ?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9543446c1cee> to learn about the holiday. But the city more broadly is a candy store for history buffs—it was a major commercial center in the 19th century thanks to its deepwater port, and the downtown Strand District, lined with Victorian buildings, was once known as the “Wall Street of the South.”

* “I’m wearing these to my next Zoom training at work so I can simultaneously learn how not to violate HIPAA laws and also enjoy my favorite episodes of The Office and maybe Seinfeld.”—Flava from Phoenix, AZ

* “Uhh, chopping onions. Why else would I wear goggles indoors?”—Ari from Brooklyn, NY

* “Skiing. While going downhill, it gives you directions to the shortest lift line, and on the lift, you can VR downhill to get extra runs in. When you’re done, it takes you to the nearest hot tub with drink service.”—Jake from Colorado

This week’s question

Grimace, the purple McDonald’s mascot, had his birthday last week. To celebrate the chaotic Gemini, the fast-food chain rolled out a birthday meal promotion consisting of medium fries, a choice of a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNugget, and a berry-flavored purple milkshake. So, here’s our question: What other mascot needs their own birthday meal and what would the meal be?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “Lil’ Red, sidekick to the University of Nebraska’s other mascot and beefed-up cowboy, Herbie Husker, should celebrate his birthday with three slices of Casey’s breakfast pizza, a large cherry Pepsi, and the gray Pride skittles.”

Looming UPS strike threatens to deliver economic chaos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i5?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> UPS truck <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i5?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
United Parcel Service might soon not be at your service as its workers threaten to walk off the job. Members of the Teamsters union representing 340,000 UPS workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i6?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=03341c7c1ad7> a strike if they can’t agree to a new contract by July 31.

If the labor action happens, it would be the biggest strike against a single employer in US history, with much more than just your drop-shipping dreams at stake.

The US without UPS

A UPS work stoppage would cause economic mayhem, snarling supply chains in a throwback to the pandemic-era days when tracking one’s delayed Amazon order was America’s favorite pastime.

UPS is the largest shipping service in the nation, according to CNN, moving enough goods to account for about 6% of the US GDP, per the company’s own estimates.

Senders would need to find an alternative delivery method for 24 million packages (about a quarter of all packages nationwide) that UPS delivers daily, per global shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes.

Analysts say that companies are already shifting orders to other shipping providers like FedEx and DHL, though no single entity could handle all its packages. But the logistics chaos can still be averted if UPS drivers and warehouse workers reach an agreement with their bosses.

What could send workers to the picket lines?

The Teamsters want higher wages, more full-time work, the elimination of what they call “forced overtime,” and better working conditions. Union members are particularly disgruntled by a system in which new employees get paid significantly less than old-timers.

The union says that folks on the UPS payroll deserve a share in the company’s success, as it reached a record $100 billion in revenue last year. According to ABC, many UPS employees feel shortchanged by a 2018 contract that has been credited with helping the company grow its profits.

But, in a sign that the labor conflict might cool, a major breakthrough in the negotiations was reached on Tuesday when UPS management agreed to include AC in vehicles purchased after Jan. 1, 2024.

Zoom out: If the UPS drivers’ union delivers results, that could embolden employees at other companies, like the workers at Amazon—whom The Teamsters are also trying to unionize.—SK

DOJ highlights major problems with Minneapolis police.

As a result, the DOJ is working with the MPD on an agreement that would require it to make changes. President Biden called the report “a positive step forward,” but also urged Congress to pass a law improving US policing.

DraftKings bets bigger than Fanatics on PointsBet.

DraftKings says it can get a green light from regulators faster because it already operates in the areas PointsBet does. “I guess they are more concerned about us than I would have thought,” Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin snarked to CNBC, calling the rival offer a bid to delay his company from entering a new market.

Ja Morant suspended for 25 games over second gun video.

The punishment was handed down after Morant had already faced an eight game suspension over an earlier video of him with a gun in a Denver nightclub. ESPN estimated that the latest penalty will cost the player, who was due to make $33.5 million next season ~$7.5 million. But Nike, which has an endorsement deal with the star, said it would continue “to support him on and off the court."

We can now add Spotify to the list of high-profile institutions Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have parted ways with.

The couple’s $20 million deal to create content for the company, announced in 2020 after the pair broke with the royal family, is over <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ic?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12f37a428cf7>. It yielded…just one podcast series, Archetypes, hosted by Meghan, which will not be renewed for a second season, despite debuting at the top of Spotify’s charts and featuring guests like Serena Williams and Mariah Carey.

For those keeping score, the couple’s efforts to rebrand themselves as media moguls have yielded some hits: Their Netflix docuseries commanded millions of viewers, and Harry’s memoir, Spare, became the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time. But the deal with Spotify won’t rank as one of their successes—the Wall Street Journal reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8id?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9adad99577b8> the couple didn’t hit the benchmarks to get the full $20 million.

Zoom out: Though both sides painted the end of the collab as mutual, the demise of the Sussexes’s deal reflects a larger podcast pivot at Spotify. The company laid off 200 people this month as part of its turn away from exclusive deals like this one. Spotify will now focus on making money off ads rather than using pods to drive sign-ups after investing more than $1 billion in podcasting.—AR

Grimace takes over the internet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ih?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Grimace, one of the original McDonaldland characters, has gone viral <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ih?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo: McDonald's/ Photo Illustration: Hannah Minn
McDonald’s recently announced a new meal campaign starring its purple mascot, Grimace, in true cat-ran-across-my-keyboard fashion: by tweeting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ii?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d7cce41ea32d> “fhioea;odijcfaewklcldW,” followed by a selfie captioned “it grimace i’m taking over.”

The offering features a new purple shake that some say tastes like Fruity Pebbles, or bubblegum, or the milk of a screaming Grimace <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ik?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a9114d7310d>.

McDonald’s even released a video game <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8il?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3f939434e101> starring a skateboarding Grimace that tugs at the Game Boy Color heartstrings. The pixelated adventure reacquaints players with classic McDonaldland characters who starred in brand advertising from the 1970s until 2003.

Why the throwback? Nostalgia marketing plays to our emotions, and in this case, McDonald’s is targeting millennials and some Gen Zers who grew up during the mascot-heavy heyday of its ad campaigns. “We’re excited to put a modern spin on these memories to continue to drive McDonald’s relevance with a new generation,” the company explained in a press release.

With tensions rising between the US and China, US CEOs have been flocking to China lately, traveling to the major market to smooth things over—but Gates’s visit marks the president’s first known meeting with an American business leader this year. The reception for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s finally taking his delayed trip to China this weekend, is not expected to be as warm.

Good morning. Yesterday, Sweden reported higher-than-expected inflation for May, causing economists to wonder: What could have kept prices elevated?

And then it hit them like a ray of sun: Beyoncé. The pop superstar kicked off her Renaissance tour in Stockholm last month, drawing 80,000+ fans to the city’s Friends Arena over two nights. In response to the influx of concertgoers, hotels and restaurants raised their prices to such a degree that it boosted overall inflation, Danske Bank concluded.

The fact that one person, by the sheer force of her popularity, was responsible for higher inflation in an entire country is…not normal. Danske’s chief economist in Sweden, Michael Grahn, said, “It’s quite astonishing for a single event. We haven’t seen this before.”

Bud Light’s fall from No. 1 was a long time coming <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bs?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Bud Light is no longer America's top-selling beer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bs?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Hannah Minn/Morning Brew
Pour one out for Bud Light—for the first time in more than two decades, the blue-canned beverage is no longer the top-selling beer in the US. Following years of declines and a monthslong boycott that further tanked sales, Bud Light is now second to the gold-foiled Modelo Especial.

But this shift in the brewski hierarchy has been years in the making: American drinkers have been getting thirstier for Mexican import beers, in addition to wines, spirits, and seltzers. Modelo, a Mexican lager, was already set to surpass Bud Light <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bt?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=22d66311066a> as early as next year, so the boycott in response to Bud Light’s partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney just sped things up, according to the Wall Street Journal.

While Modelo has enjoyed double-digit growth in at least 35 of the past 40 years, Bud Light’s dominance over US retail-store beer sales has been sliding for more than a decade. Its market share steadily declined from 19% in 2010 to 10% in the days leading up to Mulvaney’s viral Instagram post, in which she showcased a personalized tallboy the company sent her.

Since Mulvaney’s post on April 1, Bud Light’s market share dropped sharply and now sits at 7.3%, while Modelo leads with 8.4%, according to the consulting firm Bump Williams. In that same time, shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bud Light’s parent company, fell by 15% amid broader S&P 500 gains.

Other Anheuser-Busch beers like Budweiser, Busch Light, and Michelob Ultra have also experienced declines since April, and some distributors—many of which are independently owned by families—are now considering layoffs to counter their losses.

Seller’s remorse? Anheuser-Busch actually owns Grupo Modelo—the Mexican brewery that makes Modelo, Corona, and Pacífico—everywhere except in the US. Back in 2013, as part of an antitrust deal, Anheuser-Busch sold the US rights to Modelo to Constellation Brands, which owns big names like SVEDKA and Kim Crawford Wines.—ML

The EU wants to break up Google’s ad tech business. Two years after opening a probe into whether Google unlawfully boosted its own ad tech over others, the EU finally slapped the company with a formal antitrust complaint <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bx?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=533297d257e7> yesterday, accusing it of abusing its position. The complaint is a doozy; it suggests Google will likely need to sell off parts of the business to resolve its “inherent conflicts of interest” in the digital advertising world. Expect a long legal battle: The online ads provided 80% of Alphabet’s $280 billion annual revenue last year.

Neely was experiencing homelessness and mental health issues, and a video of Penny putting him in a chokehold sparked protests and calls for prosecution. Penny has maintained that he was defending himself and his fellow passengers, and after several Republican politicians praised him, a legal fund for him raised nearly $3 million.

Air con has been a major sticking point in negotiations between the company and the Teamsters, which represents 340,000 UPS workers. Union members are expected to authorize a strike if there’s no final deal by the time their current contract expires on July 31. A strike would have major economic fallout: UPS estimates that 6% of the US gross domestic product gets transported in its trucks.

Check on your friends with high-paying jobs you can’t quite explain: They might be the first to be replaced by AI. McKinsey & Co. released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bJ?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=65fe678d84ed> a report this week on how generative AI (think ChatGPT and Midjourney) will change the world’s workforce.

The findings: After examining 2,100 tasks across 850 jobs around the globe, the report concluded that generative AI could add anywhere from $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion worth of value to the global economy. How? By giving businesses more use cases for AI and revving up productivity like we’ve never seen before, especially for workers in customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development fields.

The report expects generative AI to automate tasks that take up 60%–70% of people’s working hours. In an ideal world, this means more time for the fun parts of your job, or four-day workweeks. But in this world, it could mean your future coworkers are large language models.

Good morning and Happy Flag Day, which commemorates the day in 1777 that the Stars and Stripes was first adopted. Here are some other flag facts:

The current design is the 27th iteration of the flag and the longest-used design, since the US hasn’t added a new state since 1959 (plus the 51st star would mess up the symmetry).

Despite what you may have learned in middle school, there’s no evidence Betsy Ross had any role in making the first flag.

Last year, four senators introduced the All-American Flag Act to require the federal government to exclusively buy American flags made in the USA. As of 2017, the US imported 10 million American flags from abroad, 99.5% of which were made in China.

If you’re in Minneapolis or Honolulu, congrats on living in the first major US cities to return to the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.

If you’re dealing with $7 orange juice like the rest of us, there’s still reason to be cautiously optimistic. Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May, and the closely watched measure of inflation showed that consumer prices rose 4% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86Q?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4fd07021cf83> annually last month, less than half of the rate of peak inflation in June 2022.

While prices are still rising briskly in certain sectors of the economy, the overall report was a hopeful sign that our long inflation horror story could be entering its final chapters.

4 key takeaways from the report

1. Energy is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Cheaper energy played a major role <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86R?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6806bc4bef9> in pulling inflation down to 4% last month from 4.9% in April, per Axios. Gas prices plunged almost 20% from last year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fuel costs to the moon, while broader energy prices fell nearly 12%.

2. “Revenge spending” is down. Once pandemic lockdowns lifted, Americans splurged on vacations, leisure, and recreation (new pickleball paddles!) in what economists dubbed “revenge spending.” Now that everyone has taken their weeklong trip to Italy, there are signs that revenge spending is waning: Airfare prices dropped 13% annually in May and, according to the US Travel Association, hotel demand is below 2019 levels. Bad for your Insta, but good for inflation.

3. Food prices are up. The cost of food ticked up 0.2% in May from April after staying flat in the previous two months, showing how inflation has persisted on grocery store shelves. But not all aisles are created equal—the price of eggs dropped nearly 14% from April (the biggest one-month drop since 1951), while fruit and veggie prices rose 1.3%.

4. More than anything else, rent is propping up inflation. Shelter costs are the largest category in the CPI report, and they’re still on the upward march, climbing 8.7% from a year earlier. The good news: Economists say this government data doesn’t reflect on-the-ground information, such as reports of softening rent by Zillow and Apartment List. Shelter costs in the CPI are expected to decline during the second half of the year.

Looking ahead…later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a pause in interest rate hikes after 10 consecutive increases. And, if inflation continues to drop like it did last month, he may not start up again <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86S?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ce4f718f73fb> anytime soon, analysts told Bloomberg.—CC

Donald Trump was arraigned in a Miami courthouse.

The indictment is the first time that a former president has been charged with federal crimes and marks the second time that Trump has been charged with crimes this year. Still the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, Trump later proclaimed his innocence in a speech from his golf course in New Jersey.

Instant Pot’s once-grand dreams of taking over your kitchen came out underdone. Its parent company, Instant Brands, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86-?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c2242a785052> Monday to get its battered finances in order.

Not long ago, Instant Pot devotees were compared to a cult. The easy-to-use pressure cooker exploded in popularity in 2016, speeding up stews and dominating cooking blogs pitching “65 easy Instant Pot recipes for quick weeknight dinners.” The Swiss Army knife of kitchen appliances regularly became a top seller on Amazon’s Prime Days.

In 2019, private equity firm Cornell Capital scooped up Instant Pot and plotted to grow its reach faster than the countertop hog could finish your carnitas.

But fly too close to the broiler, and you’re going to get burnt.

Hungry for expansion, Cornell pushed Instant Brands <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86_?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=515d7ae5be74> to release new gadgets, like air fryers and an air purifier. Those flopped.

At the same time, sales of Instant Pot and its fellow multicookers fell by half from 2020 to 2022, according to NPD Group.

What happened? You can blame the device’s flameout on Covid-era supply chain snags, lower demand for lightning-quick meals as more people work from home, or the fact that “no product stays at a phenom level forever,” according to Instant Brands CEO Ben Gadbois.

Looking ahead...could air fryers be the next kitchen disruptor to stall out? Based on similarly cooling sales, possibly.—MM

A new Beatles track will drop this year with artificial intelligence joining the Fab Four on Abbey Road.

Yesterday, Paul McCartney told the BBC <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/874?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=55dca3630ebd> that AI helped him use a demo recording of John Lennon singing an unpublished song to create a last hurrah from the iconic band, which broke up more than 50 years ago.

Sir Paul did not reveal the name of the soon-to-be-released song, but fans are speculating that it’ll be “Now And Then,” one of the songs that Lennon recorded in the late ’70s on a cassette labeled “For Paul” that Yoko Ono gave to McCartney after her husband’s death.

So, how does this tech bring Lennon’s voice back to life?

McCartney said the AI was trained to recognize his bandmate’s voice and then used to separate it from background noise and instruments.

Key performance indicators <#> Chart of Pornhub traffic during the Champions League final Morning Brew
Stat: There are only a few things that can get people to stop thinking about sex, and one of them is sports. During the Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan on Saturday, traffic on Pornhub plunged 32% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/879?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f19534e5115> below average in Italy (then surged 17% in the hours after Inter lost), according to Pornhub Insights.

Good morning. This is news to us, but apparently Tuesday is the new Friday—at least in NYC. According to the NY Post, restaurant owners across the city are seeing a “seismic shift <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82M?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12afbe93048e>” in Tuesday vibes as it moves from sleepy date night to full-on party mode.

At one midtown restaurant, diners are drinking 20% more wine on Tuesdays than on Fridays. At another spot, Tuesday is the busiest night of the week. And it’s not unheard of for people to make reservations two weeks ahead to eat out on a Tuesday.

So, just extrapolating here…if Tuesday is the new Friday, then Wednesday morning meetings are the new bottomless brunch.

Will the UK become a crypto hub? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83f?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Coin with British flag <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83f?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The UK seems poised to become the center of the famously decentralized crypto universe now that one of the world’s biggest venture capital firms is betting crypto pitches will land better with a cockney accent.

VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83g?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2a528d8abfb1> over the weekend its first office outside the US will be opened in London, where it plans to focus on blockchain investments. A16z cited UK authorities’ bullishness on Web3 as the reason for establishing its international outpost there.

Andreessen Horowitz also announced funding for the UK-based blockchain venture Gensyn—which is focused on AI development—and the VC firm’s plans to hold its annual crypto startup accelerator in London next year.

The UK offers clarity (for better view of the moon)

A16z said that “a clear regulatory regime” is essential to blockchain innovation and the UK aims to provide just that. Its government recently unveiled plans to come up with comprehensive crypto rules that protect consumers and incentivize innovation.

It starts at the top:

It was clear that now-UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was on the blockchain bandwagon when last year, as chancellor of the exchequer, he told Morning Brew that he looks at and follows NFTs of “dumb monkeys.” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83h?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8071aa1b224b>

He’s since talked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83i?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=73965edcf6a7> about turning the country into a global hub for crypto and pushed to make stablecoins (e.g., crypto pegged to a traditional currency) legal tender.

Meanwhile, US authorities have made it clear that the sheriff has come to town for some litigation-based regulation of an industry that’s often compared to the Wild West. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (the latter of which is an a16z portfolio company) last week in cases that could imperil their stateside future.

Best of all, the engine is compatible with a variety of fuels, including hydrogen. This could unlock a 100% green energy solution for the combustion engine market.

JPMorgan agrees to pay Epstein victims $290 million. The bank, which counted the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as a client between 1998 and 2013, has reached a deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82O?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=559834a41efd> to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of women Epstein sexually abused or trafficked that claims it ignored red flags. The deal comes after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was deposed in the suit. If the judge approves the settlement, it won’t totally wipe out JPMorgan’s Epstein-related headaches: The bank is still facing a suit from the US Virgin Islands. Deutsche Bank settled a similar lawsuit last month for $75 million.

Gen Z came to court to slay yesterday as the trial kicked off in a landmark lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82R?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a54993284975> brought by young people in Montana who claim inaction on climate change has violated their right to “a clean and healthful environment,” which is guaranteed by the state’s constitution.

The lawsuit, lodged by 16 young Montanans in March 2020, marks the first time a US youth climate case has made it to open court. The group representing the plaintiffs has filed one in all 50 states, but most have been dismissed before making it to trial—though a high-profile case against the federal government also recently got the green light to move forward toward a trial.

During the two-week trial, the plaintiffs, age 5 through 22, will argue that because of the state’s fossil fuel-friendly stance (Montana is a major coal exporter), they’ve been harmed by side effects of a warming planet like heat, drought, and wildfire smoke. The state will retort its contributions to the problem were minor.

Looking ahead…a win for the young people probably won’t lead to any immediate changes in Montana’s energy policy and would most likely be appealed—but the case could still provide an important precedent for how courts handle similar claims.—AR

A California family is selling what they estimate to be one million copper pennies they found in a late relative’s basement crawl space.

Worth $10,000 at face value, the coins are being priced at more than double because they might contain rare finds worth a small fortune, according to the sellers. The family listed the copper pennies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82W?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=81cf604dda5b> on OfferUp for $25,000 after local bank branches told them they didn’t have room to hold the thousands of pounds of Abe Lincolns.

Pennies were all copper until 1943, when the material demands of World War II prompted the United States Mint to switch over to zinc-coated steel. A few dozen copper pennies were accidentally made that year, and one of them sold for $300,000 at auction in 2022.

By 1982, new pennies were made almost entirely of zinc. The family says that’s when their relative began buying up old copper ones to build wealth for future generations. There’s more than two cents’ worth of copper in each pre-1982 penny.

A penny earned: The family isn’t interested in scouring their two truckloads of pennies for treasure—they just want to sell them to a patient someone who’s willing to schlep. As of yesterday, they had around 300 offers, the New York Times reported.—ML

Good morning. You come across a lot of weird headlines in this job, but “Conor McGregor sends the Heat mascot to ER” in The Athletic is among the strangest.

During the NBA Finals game Friday night, the former UFC champ clocked the Miami Heat’s mascot, Burnie, twice as part of a choreographed bit to promote McGregor’s pain relief spray. But apparently he forgot he was an elite mixed martial artist, because he punched the man who plays Burnie so hard that the poor guy had to be briefly treated in the hospital (he’s fine now).

UFC President Dana White said having a pro fighter punch a mascot “doesn’t seem like the brightest thing in the world.”

You’ll need to find a site other than Reddit to distract you from work today, because thousands of subreddits are going dark <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-x?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=950a677be871> in protest of the company’s recent API updates.

Nearly 3,500 subreddits will be inaccessible for the next 48 hours and perhaps much longer, according to the BBC. The protest includes five of the 10 most popular forums, such as r/gaming, r/aww, and r/todayilearned.

What are they protesting?

In April, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company would begin to charge for access <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5nk?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41ebfb96b8d4> to its application programming interface (API), which allows third-party developers to tap into Reddit’s vast trove of data to build their own apps or train AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

Huffman told the NYT that this data is valuable and that it doesn’t make business sense to keep giving it away for free. (Elon Musk made a similar decision at Twitter earlier this year, revoking free API access and introducing paid tiers.)

But it’s being called way too expensive

Key players in the Reddit ecosystem say they can’t afford to pay for API access and will need to shut down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-y?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=adfd854917b9>, sparking outrage toward Reddit’s leadership.

Who are these key players? Third-party Reddit apps.

If you’re not deep in the Reddit world, you might not know that many users consume Reddit not through Reddit’s official app, but through third-party apps that use Reddit’s API.

These apps show Reddit content but aim to improve the site’s famously janky user experience by adding features like customizable gestures and an easier-to-read comments layout.

And the new pricing plan would put them out of business. The developer behind the most-used Reddit app, Apollo, shocked the internet when he wrote that Reddit’s new API pricing would cost him $20 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-z?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a2c551185e63> per year to keep operating the app. Unable to afford that, Apollo and other third-party Reddit apps will shut down on June 30, the day before the pricing plan goes into effect.

Big picture: Reddit’s push to monetize its API right now is not a coincidence—the company is planning to IPO this year, and adding a new revenue stream could boost its valuation before hitting the public markets. But by trying to beef up its stats line, Reddit has lost the trust of its most engaged users.

One of the most notorious American criminals of the 20th century, Ted Kaczynski, died by suicide <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-I?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26c8eb42df23> on Saturday in prison at 81 years old, the AP reported.

Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, was a convicted terrorist who orchestrated a bombing campaign from his shack in Montana, eluding authorities for nearly two decades. From 1978–1995, Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 using homemade pipe bombs that unleashed nails and razor blades on his victims. The FBI gave him the nickname the Unabomber because he targeted universities and airlines.

Kaczynski’s reign of terror gripped the world—not only because of his grisly crimes, but because of why he purportedly did them. A Harvard-trained math prodigy, Kaczynski came to reject technology and science and claimed that humans were slaves to machines.

But his urge to share his anti-tech beliefs with the world ultimately led him to be caught. After the Washington Post and the New York Times published the Unabomber’s manifesto in 1995 at the request of the FBI, Kaczynski’s brother recognized his writing style and tipped off authorities.

  Photo of the week <#> A diablo IV poster shown in NYC while smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed the city @Nick_Newman on Twitter This billboard in New York City promoting the release of the Diablo IV video game was maybe a little too spot-on, when smoke from Canadian wildfires turned Northeastern cities into hellscapes.

Lulu Cheng Meservey, an exec at Diablo-maker Activision Blizzard, denied <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7X-?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=767d0c328907> that the wildfire smoke was an elaborate marketing stunt. “I would like to clarify that Blizzard has no affiliation or partnership with the wildfires in Canada. In fact we are firmly against wildfires and condemn them in the strongest terms,” she tweeted.

  Dept. of Progress <#> Hey Arnold saying Hey Arnold!/Paramount Global Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even eat a meal prepared by a robot.

Robots learned how to make salads through observation. Get the Kardashians in here because a robot just made some salads. Researchers from the University of Cambridge programmed what looks like a bionic arm with eight simple salad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7X_?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fb793d473247> recipes that it was able to identify and recreate by watching video footage of a human chef making them. The robot also picked up on a new recipe just from observation and noticed double portions and human errors, too, according to the researchers. This development shows how video could make automated food production easier and cheaper.

Uncovered burials set the record for most ancient funeral. New excavations of South African caves revealed that extinct apelike human relatives were burying their dead at least 100,000 years before Homo sapiens held what were previously thought to be the first funerals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y0?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d431f94e2418>. The research team that discovered the symbol-engraved burial sites of Homo naledi—a smaller-brained precursor to Homo sapiens—say this could change our understanding of human evolution. Scientists previously thought funerals were exclusively a big-brain behavior.

A female croc “virgin” birthed a baby. Ladies, we’re getting closer: Scientists just confirmed that a female crocodile in Costa Rica gave birth to a 99.9% genetically identical offspring after being in captivity without males for about 16 years. Self-reproduction or “virgin births”—scientifically known as facultative parthenogenesis—have been observed in some birds, fish, and other reptiles, but this is a first for crocs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y1?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41a4fe3f6ca8>. The fully formed fetus, laid in an egg in 2018, was unfortunately stillborn, but this is still a big discovery that suggests some dinosaur ancestors might also have been able to self-reproduce.—ML

  Saudi’s ambitions are much bigger than golf <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-o?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a LIV golfer walks up to the green <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-o?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Chris Trotman/LIV Golf/Getty Images The Gulf State became the Golf State this week as the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league merged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7MI?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5959beff6f64> with the PGA Tour. Pro golf will now be synonymous with a new joint venture bankrolled by the Saudi government’s massive piggy bank, the $650 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF).

But what amounts to a purchase of an entire sport is not a one-off impulse buy: The oil-rich kingdom is splurging to style itself as the ultimate hub for elite sports, world-class art, and luxury leisure.

All these investments are part of Vision 2030, an effort by the country’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka “MBS”), to diversify its fossil fuel-dependent economy. And a major prong of the plan is convincing the world that Saudi is no longer an ultraconservative theocracy.

Where’s all the cash going?

Most notably, Saudi is going all-out to achieve sports superpower status.

* Cristiano Ronaldo is already scoring for Al Nassr FC in Riyadh, while legendary French striker Karim Benzema recently announced he’d also join the Saudi Pro League.

* Beginning in 2021, Formula 1 stars started competing annually at a state-of-the-art racetrack in Jeddah for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

And it wants more: The kingdom is reportedly eyeing investments in boxing and cricket. Meanwhile, some speculate it could come for the NBA (which recently allowed sovereign fund investments) or even the NFL (which currently forbids foreign ownership).

It’s not neglecting the arts either: Saudi is hosting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YQ?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7c94b33b6fae> an Andy Warhol exhibition in the desert this year, and plans to build a contemporary art museum in partnership with the world-renowned Paris-based Centre Pompidou.

Both cinemas and music festivals were banned there until 2017, but last year it hosted the star-studded Red Sea International Film Festival featuring some LGBTQ programming (while it still outlaws homosexuality). The same month, Post Malone and Bruno Mars performed in front of raving crowds at the Soundstorm music festival <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YR?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8291f9acd45f>.

But it remains to be seen if the image rehab will work

Experts say that the glamour of its cultural calendar is meant to distract from the fact that Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with abysmal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YS?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5ecd02f1f75c> women’s rights, virtually non-existent religious freedom, and troublesome labor practices that one human rights advocate described <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YT?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4abfe6f77bb8> as “modern-day slavery.”

The entertainment glow up is intended to appease critics at home and abroad. Geopolitical risk consultant Sami Hamdi told Morning Brew he sees it as a way to buy the loyalty of the nation’s youth. He describes it as a social contract between MBS and Saudis, which Hamdi calls “a simple one: ‘I will let you party… I’ll let you wear a bikini on a beach. But in exchange, you will not ask me for civil rights.’”

Foreigners might still be wary

For companies doing business in Saudi Arabia, Hamdi warns that besides the obvious reputational risk, there are also issues with transparency and the rule of law. He says that for companies starting projects there, “the position of their [local business] partner within the political structure of Saudi Arabia” means more than official regulations.

And even all those billions might not convince elites Saudi Arabia is truly the place to be. It’s rumored that Lionel Messi’s wife’s reluctance to move to a country that only recently allowed women to drive was a factor in his decision to reject an eye-popping offer from a Saudi team.

Looking ahead…despite the kingdom’s apparently bottomless pockets, it might eventually run out of cash for shiny-toy projects. Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld pointed out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YU?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a58eadb4abe2> that the price of oil (its main export) has declined and that some of MBS’s other big investments haven’t panned out.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Colorado’s most famous Mexican restaurant <#> Casa Bonita Hyoung Chang/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

A shuttered Colorado restaurant featured in a 2003 episode of South Park is getting a revival thanks to…the creators of South Park.

Casa Bonita was a beloved Mexican restaurant in the Denver area that went bankrupt during the pandemic. But Colorado natives Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the duo behind South Park, knew this place was too special to gather cobwebs. So, in 2021, they paid $3.1 million to buy Casa Bonita, and then spent up to $40 million (!) renovating it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y3?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc38a14ecd89> ahead of its reopening, which is set to happen in the next few weeks, the NYT reported.

What made Casa Bonita so iconic? It certainly wasn’t the food, which diners often complained about (there were no ovens or ranges in the antiquated kitchen, so every dish was steamed, Stone told the NYT).

But the entertainment value more than made up for the rubbery pollo. Casa Bonita was a kid’s version of Las Vegas: It had a maze patrolled by skeletons, puppet shows, and divers plunging into a pool every 20 minutes. South Park captured the chaos in an episode <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y4?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a90d22549973> from its seventh season centered around Casa Bonita.

In their renovation of the restaurant, Parker and Stone tried to keep as much of the original kitsch intact while upping the food quality. They’ve hired a six-time James Beard Award-nominated chef, Dana Rodriguez, to run a 110-person kitchen and reimagine the menu.

Who knows whether the South Park guys will ever recoup their $40 million, but the hype for Casa Bonita 2.0 is off the charts: More than 100,000 people have signed up on its website for a reservation. You can get in line here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y5?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ba0fbcf64b58>.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the most niche theme for a party you’ve been to or thrown? Here are our favorite responses.

* “I’m currently planning a soup party with a ‘New York Stock Exchange’ theme where everyone must dress like a stockbroker and bring their best soup stocks (chicken, beef, veggie, etc.) to trade.”—Justin from Brooklyn, NY

* “My older sister hosted a funeral for her car that had been destroyed by rats. Everyone dressed for a funeral and brought their favorite road trip snacks as they mourned ‘Frank the Sonata.’ She printed out pictures of famous rats (like Remy from Ratatouille) and X’ed out their eyes in solidarity with the car.”—Emme from San Antonio, TX

* “My aunt and I share a birthday, and we just happened to turn 64 and 27 the same year. That year we had a cube-themed party with foods served in cube shapes.”—James from Washington, DC

* “A group of my college friends hosted an organ donor-themed party. There were no costumes, decorations, or anything special, but a person at the door checked IDs to see if you were an organ donor. If you were, you got a $5 keg cup and walked in. If you weren’t, you were questioned about why you didn’t sign up to be an organ donor when you got your driver’s license, had to pay double, and also had to swear you would sign up to be an organ donor.”—Anonymous

How Tesla won the US charging race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZL?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tesla charger with green upwards arrow going through it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZL?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Tesla will soon be serving up voltage to more non-Tesla drivers. And, thanks to recent deals with other automakers, the shape of its charging plug might soon dominate the US EV market.

This week, GM and Tesla announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZM?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fb67a92a0b0d> they agreed to a deal that will allow GM EVs to get juiced up by 12,000 fast chargers in Tesla’s sprawling network of charging stations. The partnership follows a similar agreement reached with Ford last month, making Tesla look like it’s in charge of charging.

Its charger network is the biggest of any EV-maker in the US, boasting 20,000 fast chargers in 1,800 spots nationwide, but it wasn’t necessarily obvious that Tesla would become the charging standard-bearer.

The company took a major gamble when it decided to make its charging system incompatible with other EVs that use the biggest competing standard, the Combined Charging System (CCS).

But now analysts say other automakers are likely to follow in GM’s and Ford’s footsteps to design EVs using Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS).

Tesla’s standard is set to become the industry standard, since the deals mean the top three EV producers (which currently account for ~70% of US EV sales) all use it.

Tesla won’t be charging free of charge: The GM and Ford partnerships will help it rake in an additional $5.4 billion in annual revenue by 2032, according to a Piper Sandler estimate. And in more good news for the EV giant, the White House said yesterday that Tesla can receive government subsidies to build more charging stations if they include CCS adapters so other EVs can use them, too.

Tesla is on a roll…its stock climbed 27% over the past two weeks, (losing short sellers over $6 billion, according to S3 Partners). In addition to the Ford and GM deals, investors are charged up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZN?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=90e9627da78f> about rumors that the company plans to ship more Cybertrucks than predicted.—SK

It alleges Donald Trump kept boxes of documents in a bathroom and on a ballroom stage at Mar-a-Lago and that he twice showed secret information to people who did not have security clearances (once while noting that he was no longer able to declassify documents). Trump, who denies doing anything wrong, is expected to appear in court Tuesday before Aileen Cannon, a judge he appointed and who ruled in his favor on issues earlier in the case. A Trump aide was also indicted.

Netflix subscriptions jump after password-sharing crackdown.

Netflix added 100k US subscribers on each of two days after enforcing the new rules.

The children, who ranged from an infant to a 13-year-old, survived the May 1 Cessna crash that killed their mother and the two other adults on the aircraft and had been wandering in the Amazon jungle ever since. They were evacuated for medical care after being found by an intensive military-led search that also involved scouts from the local indigenous community.

Teens who loiter in parking lots and slam six energy drinks before 9am might live forever. The amino acid taurine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZU?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ab2ae2155a8>, which is found in meats, seafood, and energy drinks, could be the magic elixir of living longer.

Researchers fed high concentrations of taurine to mice, monkeys, and worms and published their promising results Thursday in the journal Science. All groups receiving the extra taurine were healthier and lived longer: Mice taking the supplement lived about 10%–12% longer than the control group and had higher muscle endurance.

How does it work? Scientists don’t yet know whether humans will see similar results, but they think that supplementing with amino acid, which you naturally produce less of as you age, may delay the health issues that come with aging.

There's a lot of caveats. For starters, the animals were given huge doses of taurine relative to their body weight. For a human to take that level exclusively from energy drinks, they’d have to drink about 63 cans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZV?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=02bdb3b30a02> of Monster…per day, according to the BBC.

If you often shake your fist at society’s downward spiral into an immoral hellscape, you’re not alone—but a new study says you might be wrong.

Over the past 70 years, survey respondents worldwide have consistently said they think humanity is experiencing a decline in kindness, honesty, and other values—but a peer-reviewed study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Z-?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3d2215332c69> published by Nature this week asserts that this perceived moral decay is just an illusion.

The vast majority of 220,000 Americans surveyed between 1949 and 2019 said the state of moral values was worse at the time of being surveyed than it was before. Similar polling in 59 other countries had pretty much the same results, according to the study.

But over the same period, there’s been no decline in positive answers to questions like “Were you treated with respect all day yesterday?” Some respondents even said the people in their social circles showed moral improvements between 2005 and 2020.

So, why do we yearn for the supposed good ol’ days? One theory attributes it to the brain’s rose-colored tendencies when reminiscing about the past. Our habit of focusing on bad stuff in the present, likely aided by mass media covering more bad news than good, could also be to blame.—ML

Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told CNBC the company expects fewer people to put a ring on it this year because it typically takes consumers three-and-a-quarter years to get from the first date to the proposal—and people weren’t meeting each other during lockdowns. As a result, the company predicts 2.4 million engagements this year instead of 2.8 million, before picking back up in the future, Drosos said.

Good morning. Some trips to Miami come with Apple and Adidas profit-sharing; others come with a judge reading out criminal charges against you.

Former President Trump said last night that he’d been indicted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7VM?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f155cd11b4ca> over his mishandling of classified documents and was summoned to appear in a Miami courthouse Tuesday afternoon. The DOJ did not comment, but sources confirmed to multiple news outlets that Trump’s indictment contained at least seven charges.

This marks the first time a former president has faced federal criminal charges; about two months ago, Trump was charged with falsifying business records in New York—also a first for a former president.

Despite his deepening legal troubles, Trump remains the front-runner to get the GOP nomination for the 2024 presidential election. And he started a fresh fundraising campaign within 20 minutes of announcing he’d been indicted...

From prodding gently to making straight-up threats, large companies are pulling out all the tricks to get employees back in the office.

On Wednesday, Google warned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7V8?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=35a6b3bb86ea> workers that if they didn’t abide by the company’s three-day in-office requirement, it would be noted in their performance reviews, CNBC reported. Google’s chief people officer told staff via email, “There’s just no substitute for coming together in person,” despite the company famously developing an entire suite of products to, in fact, not come together in person.

Plus, there’s a whole lot of drama at the insurer Farmers Group, the WSJ reported. Last year, its CEO informed employees that WFH was permanent. But a new guy, Raul Vargas, took over the position and last month said actually, never mind. Vargas told staff that in order to foster “collaboration, creativity, and innovation,” workers needed to be back in the office at least three days a week.

Employees revolted

Farmers Group staff raged on an internal communication site, according to the WSJ, saying they’d made huge lifestyle changes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7V9?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=32ee8aea3dfe> (like moving to new cities and ditching their cars), thinking they would get to work from their living rooms forever. Some threatened to quit, and others suggested unionizing.

Return-to-office mandates have not gone over well at other companies, either.

SCOTUS hands win to Alabama’s Black voters and bolsters voting rights law.

That map was accused of denying Black Alabamians fair representation because while Black people account for more than 25% of the state’s population, they were the majority in only one of Alabama’s seven congressional districts. The Supreme Court ordered the state to create a new map, but Alabama’s GOP attorney general said he will fight to keep it intact.

Ron DeSantis’s campaign released several images on Twitter that show DeSantis’s rival, Donald Trump, hugging and kissing Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Just Finnish things: reindeer, Nokia, and $130k speeding tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vq?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Digital speed sign that says "YOUR SPEED" and Euro symbol <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vq?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
On Sunday, a man in Finland was fined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vr?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2572792e3914> €121,000 (~$130,000) for going ~20 mph over the speed limit.

Before you decide to never rent a car in Helsinki, know two things: 1) it’s really the best way to explore the Lapland countryside and 2) speeding tickets in Finland are calculated based on income.

It’s called the “day fine” system, wherein half of the offender’s daily income is multiplied by a certain number of days, which increases according to the severity of the offense. And the driver hit with the six-figure fine has a fairly large daily income—it was Anders Wiklöf, founder of the multimillion-dollar Wiklöf Holding company and one of Finland’s richest people.

Finland established its day fine system in 1921, and other countries have adopted it since, including Switzerland, which is far from neutral when it comes to the rules of the road.

Stat: Whether they’re opting for shroom chocolates or just being hangover-conscious, Gen Z is buying noticeably less alcohol <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vw?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8681e1518818> at concerts, Billboard reported. One club owner in Tucson, AZ, told the outlet that at every event aimed at Gen Z, alcohol sales fell by as much as 25% compared to concerts for older folks. While that may be a hopeful sign for society, it’s a sobering development for smaller venues that need to make up lost revenue.

If Mark Zuckerberg is worried about Apple’s new headset treading onto Meta’s turf, he didn’t show it.

While Meta wants to emphasize social connection and activity, “every demo that [Apple] showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself,” Zuck argued. Plus, he added, Meta’s headset is seven times cheaper than Apple’s.

With no end in sight to the Canada wildfires that are blanketing the Eastern half of the US in smoke, American air quality is literally at the mercy of the wind.

Breathing is supposed to stay rough today in many already badly smogged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QR?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cf2bebecef4b> parts of the Northeast, as well as in cities further down the East Coast thanks to a low-pressure system with south-blowing winds that aren’t expected to change course until at least Saturday. Once they do, outside will look a lot less like Mars, but it’s still likely to be a hazy weekend for the greater New York, Pittsburgh, Philly, and DC areas, where people have been inhaling some of the most toxic air in the world.

The pollution has already caused flight delays, the postponement of the Yankees–White Sox game, and raids on everyone’s Covid mask stashes. Record-high air quality indexes are far above the “unhealthy” threshold of 100 (NYC surpassed 400 yesterday).

How to stay safe from the smoke

Health officials recommend that everyone...

Stay inside with windows and doors shut. Close the fireplace flue if you’re fancy, and if you have a window AC unit, the Environmental Protection Agency suggests only using it if you can seal up window frame gaps and close the outdoor air damper.

If you have central air, the EPA recommends keeping it running. If it has a fresh air setting, switch it to recirculation mode. Get some fans going, and consider buying an air purifier before they sell out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QS?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=66c17f403aae>.

Avoid frying food, doing strenuous activity, taking the dog for long walks, and smokin’ darts…even if half a pack of cigarettes is less harmful than a full day of Northeast air right now.

Looking ahead…Canada says this could be its most destructive wildfire season ever, which would make for a smoky American summer and a She’s-All-That comeback story for people who got bullied for buying those Dyson air purifier headsets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QT?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=640737f5a6ba>. While air quality over the next few days is projected to be less than good, wildfire smoke is notoriously hard to predict, so keep an eye on live forecasts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QU?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ada499439bba>.—ML

His brief time at the helm included plenty of controversies, including a recent unflattering profile in The Atlantic, pushback from staff on the handling of the Donald Trump town hall, and the layoffs that came with killing the network’s attempt at a streamer. Ratings and profits also fell during his tenure. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav took responsibility for the situation and put three execs in charge while he searches for a permanent replacement.

But investors weren’t impressed—they may have noticed that the company also announced that its revenue was down last quarter compared to a year before—sending the volatile stock plunging in after-hours trading.

Bienvenido a Miami, Messi <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Q-?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Lionel Messi in Inter Miami pink jersey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Q-?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo: Getty Images, Editing: Morning Brew
On Wednesday, Lionel Messi decided to wear pink. The Argentinian champ announced yesterday that he’s joining Inter Miami in a deal poised to change the future of US soccer.

For Messi to turn down a reported $400 million offer from the Saudi football league, Miami’s proposition had to be sweeter than a Barefoot moscato. According to The Athletic, key aspects of the deal helped bring Messi stateside.

Partnerships with Apple and Adidas: In addition to his salary, Messi will receive a cut of the revenue from new subscribers to Apple’s MLS Season Pass, and a profit-sharing agreement between him and Adidas is in the works.

Bend it like Messi: He’ll likely have a chance to buy a stake in an MLS team when he’s done playing, echoing the deal that Becks got when he joined LA Galaxy (which ultimately led to him co-owning Inter Miami).

Even after securing the biggest name in the sport, US fútbol has a long way to go. But the future looks promising: Ticket sales for the Inter Miami vs. LAFC match on Sept. 3 jumped from $81 to $422 following Messi’s announcement, per TickPick.

Zoom out: Miami sports fans haven’t had it this good since 1972. The city has a team in both the NBA and NHL championships and will also be a host for the 2026 World Cup.—CC

Covid scientists search for Ohio pooper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R2?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Covid virus in toilet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R2?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Someone has been pooping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R3?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=86924c68a793> out the same Covid strain for two years in Ohio and we need to find them. There’s nothing to be concerned about (unless it’s your poop) since the virus is inactive in waste, but scientists believe finding that person could provide some much-needed insight into the disease.

Dr. Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of Missouri medical school and head of Missouri’s wastewater sampling program, noticed that a “cryptic” strain (meaning it’s a highly specific mutation) keeps popping up in the area.

He hypothesized that it’s coming from just one person.

Based on sewage lines, he’s even pinpointed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R4?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7f6b1bc2ac2c> that the individual’s home is likely in Columbus, OH, and that they commute to work in a city called Washington Court House about 45 minutes away.

Everybody (with Covid) poops: And the virus is shed in their waste. So, sewage tracking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R5?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=59f627c33425>, while spotty around the country, remains one of the most reliable and up-to-date ways to track Covid infections in communities—especially as the US starts to shutter other community-level tracking programs.

So, why is one person’s bathroom break so important? Well, for starters, they are likely really sick and might not even know it. And, number two, studying this mystery person might be able to help scientists better understand why long-Covid infections happen and how to treat them.—MM

Good morning on the 79th anniversary of D-Day. A day before the invasion of Normandy, General Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a famous speech in which he told the troops, “The eyes of the world are upon you.”

Less known is an alternate speech Eisenhower wrote in case the invasion was unsuccessful. In what would later become one of the world's most coveted pieces of scrap paper, the general wrote, “My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. The troops, the air, and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.”

Maybe something to think about next time something goes wrong on your watch.

Apple has finally sprung its long-awaited cannonball into the augmented reality space, and it could revolutionize the industry—or flop hard.

To many gasps, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7IB?mbcid=31700007.2865009&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a249bd3ae3b> the $3,499 Vision Pro yesterday at the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The presentation claimed the mixed-reality headset—meaning it accommodates both AR and VR—will be the “most advanced personal electronics device ever.”.

Apple is positioning the headset to replace desktop computer-cluttered workspaces with an “infinite canvas” of virtual screens that hover in the field of view. Users can navigate with just their eyes, hands (no clunky controllers!), and voice.

The Vision Pro boasts an enormous virtual screen through lenses with “more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.” A new feature called EyeSight will keep users’ eyes visible through the display most of the time.

Disney CEO Bob Iger guest-starred to tease immersive experiences like watching Star Wars content while on one of the franchise’s planets. Users will also be able to play more than 100 Apple Arcade titles on Day One.

Will the Vision Pro live up to the hype?

While some believe the Vision Pro will be the iPhone of mixed-reality headsets, others aren’t so sure, considering how existing competitors have done so far.

As of March, Meta—the current industry big dog—had sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets. While they’re much cheaper and the brand has a head start, less than half of Quests were still being used six months after purchase, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Microsoft’s HoloLens headset (the newer model of which also costs $3,500) has only sold about 300,000 units since its 2016 launch.

So, why might this be different? Short answer: Apple is cool—they’re good at revamping existing markets with reinvented products. But consumers will have to wait until the Vision Pro hits shelves early next year to see if they really want to strap a screen to their faces.—ML

SCOTUS will mull “Trump too small” trademark.

While the phrase stems from a slightly racy joke Sen. Marco Rubio made about Donald Trump’s hands during the 2016 primary, the issue before the court is serious. The government asserts the trademark is not allowed because trademarks involving the names of living individuals are not permitted without their written consent. The trademark seeker claims that applying this rule would make it “virtually impossible” to register a trademark that opines on a public figure.

The government accused Hanssen of trading highly classified information from his counterintelligence roles to Moscow for $1.4 million in cash and diamonds. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 after pleading guilty to espionage. He began spying in 1979, three years after he joined the FBI, and claimed he had planned on it since he was a teenager.

Dogged JDs wanted at the world’s largest crypto exchange: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7II?mbcid=31700007.2865009&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c09dd9e06e1> Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, yesterday.

The suit comes as US regulators adopt a no-more-crypto-monkey-business attitude after the collapse of former rival exchange FTX.

The agency alleges Binance funneled customer funds to a third-party company controlled by Zhao to inflate trade volumes, misled investors about the platform’s anti-market manipulation safeguards, and operated an illegal securities exchange in the US.

Binance was barred from working with Americans directly due to the riskiness of its investment offerings, so its US-based affiliate Binance.US was supposed to be independent. But the SEC claims it wasn’t really independent at all and that it bypassed regulations allowing American clients to trade on Binance’s international platform.

Binance asserts there was no need to go to court and accused regulators of failing to clearly articulate rules for the crypto industry. But it might have a hard time proving its executives were ignorant of wrongdoing: The SEC claims Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer sent this message to a coworker in 2018: “we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.”

Zoom out: Binance is also facing a Justice Department investigation over alleged money laundering, and a civil lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.—SK

Good morning. For the US Postal Service, your dog protecting its home turf against their mail carriers is no joke. This weekend it kicked off National Dog Bite Awareness Week to…raise awareness around aggressive dogs going after the people who deliver your mail. The USPS said that last year dogs attacked more than 5,300 of its employees while delivering the mail, with Houston, LA, Dallas, and Cleveland recording the most incidents.

Sonic boom from fighter jets rocks DC. People around the nation’s capital were shocked to hear a mysterious “boom” sound <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Fe?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3b4957ed9efc> yesterday at about 3:10 yesterday afternoon. Turns out the source was F-16 fighter jets sent from Joint Base Andrews intercepting a Cessna aircraft that was not responsive. That private plane crashed in central Virginia about 20 minutes after the boom was heard. Authorities do not yet know why the plane was unresponsive or how many people were on board.

Signal error blamed for Indian rail disaster. The devastating crash that killed 275 people and injured hundreds more was caused by an error in the electronic signal system <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ff?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=39869092745a>, officials said. The system mistakenly guided a passenger train to travel along a track that made it collide with a freight train, and derailed cars from that passenger train rolled over to another track, causing another passenger train to derail. India will conduct a full investigation into how this happened, and the stakes are high: About 22 million people ride trains in India per day, according to the AP.

It might not stop there: On Friday, another parent from the same school district issued a complaint about the Book of Mormon, which is the text of Utah’s own Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Last year, the state’s GOP government passed a law that bans “pornographic or indecent” books in schools.

AI: The labor deal asserts that generative AI is not a person (huge) and that it cannot replace guild members’ responsibilities.

Gun safety: The contract bans live ammunition on set following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during the filming of Rust in 2021.

Residuals: Foreign residuals—a type of royalty that’s been eroded in the streaming era—will get a 76% bump for the biggest streaming services.

The Guild and its negotiating leaders framed the contract as a big win <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Fl?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=24dffab5cf91> for directors that gives them “unprecedented gains.” The union members will show whether they agree when they vote on the proposed contract tomorrow.

Big picture: The agreement with the directors resolves just one of three high-stakes labor negotiations going on in Hollywood right now. As you know, more than 11,000 writers have been striking for five weeks, and actors will also vote on whether to authorize a strike by 5pm PT today.

Swift announced on Friday that she’s adding shows in Latin America to her Eras Tour, and in Buenos Aires, where inflation is raging at more than 100%, some standing room only tickets are going for about $153, per Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the cheapest ticket on SeatGeek for Swift’s LA shows in August is more than $1,500. With round-trip plane tickets from LAX to Buenos Aires at ~$800 in November, the math kinda checks out.

As of April, half as many new posts were getting 10+ million views as in February 2022, when the app hit a peak of 9,259 viral videos per week. It could be because the app’s user base grew from 1 billion near the end of 2021 to 1.6 billion this past March, ushering in a slate of new influencers to compete for eyeballs with dominant OGs like Charli D’Amelio. But smaller creators are getting squeezed, too. Average views on lesser-seen TikToks have also declined since December.

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Do SNAP work requirements...work? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dd?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A person holding an empty wallet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dd?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images The ancient adage “those who don’t work, won’t eat” sounds like the inspo behind a new US law.

Older low-income people will now have to get employed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7De?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=063ae20511ed> in order to receive government food assistance as part of the debt ceiling agreement that President Biden signed this week.

The deal raises the age cutoff for work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from 50 to 54. Adults younger than 54 without disabilities and with no dependents must work at least 80 hours a month to get long-term SNAP benefits.

That would appear to be a win for Republicans, who pushed for more work requirements to cut government spending and incentivize people to get jobs. But, according to a surprise finding from the Congressional Budget Office, the deal will actually cause the government to spend more on food aid since the legislation also expands SNAP access for jobless unhoused people, veterans, and young adults who were in foster care.

The wrangling over the work requirements and subsequent questions about just how much the government will save reopened the decadeslong debate over whether a no-free-lunch-for-the-jobless policy actually boosts economic self-reliance. In short, do work requirements work?

The grind-to-eat mindset

The conservative think tank Foundation For Government Accountability claims that doling out help without strings attached “traps people in government dependency.” It recommends adding universal work requirements to poverty aid programs, arguing the measures would boost the economy by spurring folks into job-seeking action and alleviating labor shortages.

“Let’s help people get lifted out of poverty into jobs,” said House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as he promoted work requirements for government aid last month.

But economists say the numbers don’t add up

Though quality data on the subject is hard to come by, many researchers say that having a job as a prerequisite for getting food from Uncle Sam doesn’t necessarily motivate people to start beefing up their resume. Work requirements for SNAP had no effect on employment among recipients, according to a 2021 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Df?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cac101aa8ff2>. SNAP work requirements reduced the number of people receiving food subsidies by more than 50%.

Work requirements for SNAP add cumbersome paperwork to the application process that can prevent people from accessing benefits, according to social safety net scholar Jason Cook at the University of Utah. His latest research suggests <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dg?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bc40b0dee461> some people do end up working less for a short time after getting on SNAP, but that’s likely because they’re using that time to search for a better job.

Economist Elena Prager, who co-authored the NBER study, told Morning Brew that people aren’t jobless because they are choosing to freeload off SNAP instead. She blames challenges like “homelessness, undocumented disability, or lack of access to transit” for keeping folks out of the workforce. Prager says there’s evidence that subsidizing the income of low-wage workers could be a better way to nudge more people to work.

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Apple Park <#> Apple's Cupertino campus Anadolu Agency/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Tomorrow, Apple is expected to announce its biggest product launch in almost 10 years—a mixed-reality headset—at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.

You may recognize the city of Cupertino from your iPhone’s weather app, but you’re probably not as familiar with Apple Park, the company’s global headquarters since 2017. So, let’s learn a little bit more about one of the most famous office buildings in the world.

Think of Apple Park as you would any other Apple product: sleek and extra at the same time. It was conceived of by co-founder Steve Jobs and meticulously laid out by Apple’s legendary chief designer, Jony Ive, in conjunction with the architectural firm Foster + Partners. Jobs even said the building’s circular shape “resembles the circular dial on an iPod” (but sadly without that clicking sound).

Let’s talk about the shape, because not many offices could be compared to a spaceship. Apple Park’s distinctive ring extends almost one mile in circumference, which is necessary because it’s built for over 12,000 employees to work there (more than the undergrad population of nearby Stanford). And the “walls” are walls in name only—the building is enclosed by towering curved glass pieces four stories high that can slide open when there’s good weather in Cupertino. And there’s typically good weather in Cupertino.

Unsurprisingly, Jobs’s most lasting imprint on the campus is the room that’s named after him: the Steve Jobs Theater. This 1,000-seat auditorium used for events and product launches is covered by the largest carbon-fiber roof in the world, according to its architects, and doesn’t have even one column holding it up.

Oh, and one more thing: Jk, you can move on to the next section.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the best car game to play during a long road trip? Here are our favorite responses.

* “Putting on the Now That’s What I Call Music Vol 1–50 playlist (a playlist of all the songs featured on Now CDs 1–50) on Spotify and having to guess the song and artist.”—Maria from Memphis, TN

* “In the UK, Pub Cricket. You get runs every time you see a pub based on how many legs the pub name has (e.g., ‘The Lion’ is four points). You are out when the pub has no legs (e.g., ‘The Crown’).”—Izzy from the UK

* “On our road trips, we stop at thrift stores. When in the thrift store, you must go to the CD section, close your eyes, and pick one. Then, we listen to it until our final destination.”—Christy from Auburn, CA

* “A conversation made up solely of song titles. Inane, but creatively fun.”—Cathy from CT

* “I have four kids and we’ve played the ‘Useless Superpowers’ game for years in the car. We all take turns coming up with the most unuseful superpower until we stop because everyone is laughing so hard. Our all-time favorite? ‘I can control inchworms!’”—Suzanne from IA

This week’s question

What is the most niche theme for a party you’ve been to or thrown?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I host an annual chili cook-off, and one year, the theme was ‘sleep shirts.’ Everyone who attended had to bring an old shirt they’ve slept in, and the winner of the cook-off was awarded a garbage bag full of those sleep shirts.”

ECONOMY

Labor market just won’t turn the heat down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Er?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Paris Hilton <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Er?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Simple Life/Disney-ABC Domestic Television via Giphy
The US keeps adding jobs like it’s its job, based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that dropped yesterday.

The economy gained <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/1S-?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f51415d065f9> 339,000 payrolled employees in May, more than in each of the preceding three months and way more than the 190,000 Dow Jones predicted (to be fair, expert estimates lowballed 13 of the latest 16 job reports, according to CNBC).

All that growth happened in spite of climbing interest rates, inflation, recent bank failures, and a nerve-racking debt ceiling standoff that threatened to destroy the economy.

Wall Street evidently interpreted the news as a big green “buy” sign. But not all indications pointed to the hot streak continuing forever.

Signs a cooldown might be coming

The unemployment rate inched up last month, wage growth slowed, and workers appear less self-assured that the labor market is their oyster.

The self-employed crowd lost 369,000 people from its ranks in May (a possible culprit in the unemployment increase), a possible sign that folks might be ditching the flexibility of selling [insert homemade artisanal product here] for the security of a traditional employer.

And they’ve become less inclined to tell their boss “See you never!”: Recent data shows quit rates have declined from an all-time high in late 2021, in a wind down of the pandemic job-hopping trend dubbed the Great Resignation.

Someone at the Federal Reserve better have a PhD in Mixed Signals Processing

Powell and friends will have to use the conflicting economic indicators to decide whether to further crank up interest rates at their next meeting this month.

Reversing a two-year-old policy, YouTube said yesterday that it would no longer take down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ew?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9458c072d47c> content containing false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 US presidential election or other past presidential contests. The company explained that  leaving the policy in place could curtail political speech “without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.” However, it hasn’t given the final word on how it plans to treat the 2024 election, saying it would provide more information on that in the future.

Don’t use Venmo to park your cash, regulator warns. Venmo may be the best way to remind your friend that she still hasn’t settled up for her share of last month’s group dinner, but it’s not much better than stuffing bills under your mattress when it comes to keeping your money somewhere, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau cautioned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ex?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=145e2a4319b6>. The app and others, like CashApp, Apple Pay, and PayPal, aren’t banks, so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation doesn’t provide insurance for funds stored there, the CFPB pointed out. The agency said there are billions of dollars at risk if these apps were to suffer their own SVB-like failure.

Companies are paying up over forever chemicals. Chemical makers Chemours, DuPont de Nemours, and Corteva said yesterday that they agreed to pay <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ey?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4e1c3df8f031> $1.19 billion to resolve claims that they were responsible for contaminating US water systems with PFAS. But that settlement is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to litigation against a slew of companies over these chemicals in the water supply. Thousands of cases over the issue have been consolidated in federal court in South Carolina, and the first major trial against 3M is scheduled to start Monday. But Bloomberg reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ez?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f8d927af8f25> 3M is nearing a deal to resolve claims for at least $10 billion instead.

There might be a new player in the telecom field, and it’s not a startup trying to make 30-second, garbled Owl City ringtones a thing again. Amazon is potentially negotiating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EB?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=855f56d68db0> with the major wireless carriers about offering cheap (anywhere from $10 to free) wireless plans for Prime members, Bloomberg reports.

Amazon denied that such a plan was in the works, and T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon said they were not in talks with the company. But the market reacted anyway.

For the big mobile carriers, the news sent their stocks down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EC?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8d870b34fa44> as Wall Street feared a new low-cost mobile offering could undercut the vice grip they have on the market. Verizon and AT&T both dropped more than 3% yesterday and T-Mobile fell over 7%.

But the smallest player of the group, Dish Network, which declined to comment, saw its shares surge 16%. The provider is currently trying to revamp its image from the people who sold your parents an expensive satellite dish to a big-name wireless competitor. And a deal with Amazon could be the key to making that happen.

Looking ahead…any potential deal is still months away from an official announcement and there's a chance the whole thing will fall through, insiders say. But there’s also a chance that Amazon is gearing up to take over a whole new market.—MM

Tell your neighbor they can come out of their doomsday shelter—that viral story about a drone going Skynet mode on its human operator isn’t true.

The story: On Thursday, based on an aerospace association’s blog <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EH?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=df4928298914>, news sites reported that a US Air Force colonel recently said an AI drone killed its supervisor in a mission simulation. To make matters worse, Twitter did its everybody-panic-right-now thing, and some posts amplifying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EI?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ea704692c8e1> the story left out the word “simulation.”

But…the Air Force clarified that the simulated mission never happened, and news sites quickly updated articles circulating online to say the colonel was speaking hypothetically about a thought experiment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EJ?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1b52f3556fd7>.

Still, it’s understandable that people were quick to believe the story given recent statements made about AI:

On the same day the false story broke, President Joe Biden said some AI scientists he’s met with “are very worried that AI can actually overtake human thinking and planning” in an address to…the Air Force Academy’s graduating class.

Earlier in the week, Yoshua Bengio, one of AI’s “godfathers,” told the BBC that the military is “one of the worst places where we could put a super-intelligent AI.”

Of course, if the spread of misinformation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EK?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c4f6afee4ae1> online is a concern, it looks like AI’s not the only culprit.—ML

El Niño is so back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zQ?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustrated thermal map of the globe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zQ?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas
In terms of historic, Earth-changing potential, there is only one thing arriving this summer that could one-up the Barbie movie: El Niño.

If you don’t remember everything from your eighth-grade environmental science class, El Niño is the climate pattern that warms up water in the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years.

It can simultaneously lead to excessive rainfall and severe drought in different regions, particularly the tropics.

Climate change exacerbates its effects, so experts warn that this year’s El Niño <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zR?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=32c233dcccd9> could cause extreme heat with “far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management, and the environment,” according to the World Meteorological Organization.

It could also lead to trillions in economic losses

New research published in Science estimates that the next El Niño, which has a 90% chance of beginning this year, will cost the global economy $3 trillion through 2029. That astounding economic damage can come from immediate losses and longer-term knock-on effects.

Consider some of the ways El Niño has wreaked havoc in the past:

A Nature study demonstrated a link between El Niño years and civil war in 93 tropical countries. It also found that since 1950, one out of five civil conflicts has been influenced by El Niño. Why? One hypothesis relates violent conflict to declining crop yields. Another is that people are more likely to engage in conflict when they’re hot—a theory you can directly confirm by going to Carowinds in July.

A NASA study found that the 2015–2016 El Niño triggered disease outbreaks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zS?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b293e32dd86a> worldwide. Cholera spread in Tanzania due to contaminated water due to flooding, while dengue fever rates spiked in Brazil and Southeast Asia as warm, wet conditions amplified the presence of mosquitoes.

Looking ahead…your summer tan might be more St. Tropez than Saint-Tropez. As El Niño comes on the scene, it “could push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” the World Meteorological Organization said.—CC

The agreement is the latest curveball in an often contentious relationship between Musk and the US military over Starlink—the terminals have been crucial for preserving Ukraine’s communications infrastructure during the war, but Musk tweeted several months ago that he doesn’t want them used to escalate a “conflict that may lead to WW3.”

But Apple looms

Meta’s hardware drop came just days before Apple is set to reveal its first-ever VR headset on Monday. While we don’t know much about the iPhone manufacturer’s swan dive into headgear—besides its reported $3,000 price tag—we do know it’s going to be Apple’s most consequential product launch since the Apple Watch in 2014.

Bottom line: While the hype over the metaverse has cooled significantly since 2021, Meta’s and Apple’s headsets show that tech companies are still investing major resources into creating virtual worlds.—MM

There’s a fight brewing in the dairy aisle: The viral Aubrey Plaza “Wood Milk” ad stands accused of breaking federal law by unfairly going after plant-based beverages.

The April ad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A7?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7faf162c81d1> drew criticism for promoting cow’s milk by satirizing plant-based alternatives through a product named Wood Milk and calling the fictional, eau-de-wood beverage “a slime that’s legal to sell,” nutritionless, and not “real milk.” The campaign was created by MilkPEP, the same group behind the “Got Milk?” commercials of the ’90s and 2000s.

But now, it’s got legal trouble. A public health nonprofit, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, filed a complaint <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A8?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3fd181e9911c> last week asking the USDA to stop the “Wood Milk” campaign for violating two rules meant to prevent agricultural advertising from playing hardball.

The ad breaks a federal statute prohibiting statements that “may be false or misleading or disparaging to another agricultural commodity,” according to the complaint.

MilkPEP’s CEO said the campaign was created in response to a current FDA proposal to allow plant-based beverages to label themselves as “milk.” But trouble is, it uses USDA funding, which is illegal when the goal is to influence legislation.

Battle of the milks: Dairy milk consumption has fallen by 42% over the past five decades, while sales of plant-based alternatives grew 6% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A9?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26ae75a1ce97> last year, per Euromonitor.

Retailers brace for a not-so-happy Pride <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uV?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Target logo with pride sticker peeling off and the word "pride" with question mark added to the end. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uV?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas
Before most brands could even email their BEYOU23 Pride discount codes, companies have already begun facing backlash from anti-LGBTQ groups. Brands that normally roll out campaigns and merchandise for Pride Month every June are trying to navigate this year’s climate of more vocal critics empowered by right-wing celebrities and politicians.

The brands at the center of the controversies

Target: Last week, the retailer pulled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uW?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f6ba26c3015b> items created for its Pride collection by the trans designer Erik Carnell and moved displays to the back of some stores, citing violent threats to store employees. The uproar focused on one of Carnell’s designs that features the phrase “Satan respects pronouns,” which wasn’t part of Target’s collection, just his website.

The North Face: After the outdoor brand announced its Pride campaign with drag queen Pattie Gonia last Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene encouraged her supporters to boycott the brand. Fox News and some conservative twitter users claimed that the line included kids clothing, but there's no record of it on the brand’s site currently. The North Face’s parent company, VF Corporation, has defended the campaign, saying it is “honored and grateful to support partners like Pattie Gonia.”

Other companies that have recently drawn anti-LGBTQ ire include Bud Light, Kohl’s, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Even famously conservative Chick-fil-A has seen blowback for having a DEI exec.

Corporate Pride isn’t all rainbows this year: Calls to boycott companies usually fade pretty quickly, but Bud Light has seen six straight weeks of declining sales since its controversial partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and brands are nervous.

But the beer’s 26% drop in sales for the week ending May 20 (its worst week ever, according to the NY Post) could be attributed to the brand also angering the LGBTQ community and its allies with how it responded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uX?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc94df1cb9c8> to the pushback—something other brands have also done by opting to abandon or alter Pride campaigns at the first sign of trouble.

Looking ahead…most companies are still planning to move forward with Pride plans. Coors Light is the main sponsor for Denver’s Pride Parade. Levi’s and Adidas will also run ads prominently featuring gay and trans models wearing and talking about their products.—MM

Not all celebrity liquor brands are success stories like Ryan Reynolds’s Aviation Gin, and Sean Diddy Combs claims in a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v1?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3f0ae1fce3c7> against Diageo that his Ciroc vodka and DeLeon tequila brands were set up to fail. The suit seeks billions, asserting that the alcohol giant treated them as inferior “urban” lines while lavishing resources on other brands, like George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila. Diddy alleges his race was a factor in the company’s behavior, but Diageo claims it’s just a “business dispute” that’s all about the Benjamins.

There are places you can reliably find high-profile CEOs: the Juvet Landscape Hotel, Burning Man, and this week…China.

CEOs have been flooding the country, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Laxman Narasimhan of Starbucks, and Elon Musk of Tesla. And they’re not just there because they found a flight deal on Skiplagged: US executives are trying to strengthen relationships in China, a critical market for many American companies, as tensions rise between the two governments.

These visits are reviving conversations about “decoupling,” questioning what would happen if two economies, which are integral to each other’s growth, tried to stand on their own (something that both Musk and Dimon explicitly came out against).

The US-China relationship isn’t exactly simpatico at the moment…and it hasn’t been for a while because of concerns over human rights, Taiwan, and China’s relationship with Russia. While the CEOs were en route, China refused a meeting between the two countries’ defense chiefs, and the US accused a Chinese jet of approaching a US plane last week in an “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver.”

Zoom out: Whatever is happening on the political front, the presence of these hotshots in China reinforces what experts say—that the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 economies rely on each other too much right now to sever ties.—CC

Chatbot set to replace US eating disorder helpline pulled for pushing diets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v6?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tessa the chatbot told people to count their calories and do weekly weigh-ins. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v6?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas / Morning Brew
In this edition of AI that backfires: Today, a chatbot was supposed to officially replace one of the largest eating disorder helplines until it got taken offline earlier this week for encouraging calorie restriction and other unhealthy behaviors it was designed to advise against.

The National Eating Disorder Association Helpline already fired all its human workers, so they have no live support to offer right now. The nonprofit says it was a planned move to make way for the so-called wellness chatbot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v7?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ccae2828977d> named Tessa, but former staffers claim it’s a union-busting maneuver. In March, the NEDA told its six helpline employees and 200 volunteers that their roles were being replaced by Tessa just four days after it was notified of its duty to recognize its employees’ newly formed union.

But Tessa lacks the human touch the helpline had provided since 1999: One activist <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v8?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=282861566858> trying out Tessa said it told her to try to lose one to two pounds per week by having a calorie deficit, cutting down on processed and high-sugar foods, and doing weekly weigh-ins.

What now? Tessa is only offline “temporarily” until it’s rid of the “bug” that triggered dieting advice for some of the 2,500 people who tried it out, NEDA CEO Liz Thompson told the Daily Dot. Meanwhile, the helpline’s sacked union has filed unfair labor practice charges.—ML

Stat: The Denver Nuggets are favored to win this year’s NBA championship, but no matter what the scoreboard says, the team will have one guaranteed winner on the court: its mascot, Rocky.

Good morning. Big news from our Morning Brew Daily podcast: We’re releasing episodes much earlier.

Since we launched the pod in the winter, the top piece of feedback—overwhelmingly—was that people on the East Coast wanted to listen during their commutes in the morning.

So, starting today, the team is waking up when the bars are closing to record episodes to be released at 7am ET, up from 10am currently. That means this morning’s episode will probably be live by the time you’re reading this.

You can catch Morning Brew Daily on Apple Podcasts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Gn?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0708b416cdd2>, Spotify <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Go?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f0bb316170f>, watch on YouTube <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Gp?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a4804a7edf54>, or check us out wherever you get your shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Px?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5acf07380a05>.

Tell the world AI may cause human civilization to collapse without going over Twitter’s character limit.

That’s what a bunch of celebrity AI experts did when they signed a 22-word statement warning about the existential risks of the technology that was published by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety yesterday.

Those 22 ominous words: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”

Many of the signatories comparing AI to the A-bomb are the same folks who were foundational in creating the tech: Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI (which created ChatGPT), and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, as well as superstar AI researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, were among the big names who endorsed the message.

What should we be worried about?

Though intelligent machines could supercharge progress in virtually all human endeavors from drug discovery to space exploration, some experts worry they might also cause humans to go the way of the Hartford Whalers.

The Stanford Existential Risks Initiative and Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk both monitor the threats AI poses to human civilization alongside other potential species-enders like extreme climate change and nuclear winter.

These researchers are concerned about a future in which an AI that outperforms humans in various domains (but doesn’t share their values) is prone to catastrophic accidents or misuse.

Prominent AI doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky argues it’s likely that “literally everyone on Earth will die” if superhuman AI comes on the scene.

But worrying about hypothetical evil bots with a Labrador’s knack for destruction might be premature in 2023. Many AI researchers believe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pD?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4bd3e522a294> the advent of sophisticated, multi-talented AI is at least a few decades away, and there’s no consensus about how dangerous those systems might be.

Some AI engineers say we should focus less on the future existential risks and more on pressing threats like misinformation, copyright violations, privacy concerns, concentration of corporate power, and shoddy legal advice <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7mo?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=407edcf12ec0>.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> Elizabeth Holmes checking into prison Mark Felix/Getty Images
Elizabeth Holmes checks into prison. The Theranos founder arrived at the federal minimum-security women’s prison camp in Bryan, Texas, yesterday to begin serving <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pH?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a97bede13548> her 11-year sentence for defrauding investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. While at FPC Bryan, which is located about 95 miles northwest of Holmes’s hometown of Houston, she will spend time with up to 650 incarcerated women—among them Jennifer Shah, the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star who is also imprisoned there for fraud.

The war in Ukraine comes to Moscow. Drones struck apartment buildings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pI?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4dd4a77328d6> in Moscow yesterday in the first attack on residential neighborhoods in Russia’s capital since the war began. Russia claimed the drones were sent by Ukraine, and President Vladimir Putin threatened to retaliate with “tit-for-tat measures.” The bold attack on Moscow, which came after days of Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, shows how Putin may have underestimated Newton’s third law of motion when he invaded Ukraine.

A freeze on repayments has been in place since March 2020 due to Covid, and it’s been extended several times as the pandemic dragged on. This deadline for the resumption of payments is similar to the timeline previously laid out by Biden, but it prevents him from issuing another pause.

The latter two have been thrown out of the club since (as has Nvidia, which closed the day just below the $1t mark).

By elevating Nvidia to such hallowed corporate ground, investors are sending a clear message: AI will generate untold riches, and Nvidia, which produces computer chips that power most cutting-edge AI programs, will capture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7i7?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4052d510fc36> much of the value created.

Started from a Denny’s, now we’re here

Thirty years ago over a Grand Slamwich, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang started a conversation that would lead him to create a computer processing powerhouse that has seemingly rode every tech industry wave over the past few decades.

Huang does things his own way, including his fashion choices. From a formal dinner to the cover of Time magazine, Huang is almost always photographed wearing the antithesis of the tech CEO Patagonia pullover: a leather jacket, which will probably have its own Twitter account soon.

Some think Nvidia’s rise is too fast, too furious. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest argued that Nvidia’s stock is “priced ahead of the curve” in a tweet on Monday. Then again, Wood’s flagship ETF dumped all of its Nvidia shares in January, right before the stock rallied $560 billion.—CC

Now that we've all finished our $12 bottle of Dark Kiss body spray from 2013, expensive perfume is having its moment. The US pricey fragrance category has seen a 60% jump <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pT?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=459ff69344ea> this year compared to pre-pandemic levels, Sue Nabi, CEO of multinational beauty conglomerate Coty, told Yahoo.

Coty, which owns fragrance brands like Marc Jacobs and Gucci, beat its quarterly estimates earlier this month and reported 9% net revenue growth from a year earlier. The company credited a blooming fragrance market to “Gen Zs, men, [and the] Hispanic community in the US,” Nabi said.

No shocker here, but Gen Z’s interest in finding their signature scent is driven by TikTok, which is allowing them to discover indie perfume brands.

Indie fragrance brand Juliette Has a Gun just closed a new funding round after posting sales of $129 million last year.

Is the boom because we all smell bad? Not necessarily—people just need little treats, even during times of economic uncertainty. In a phenomenon dubbed the “lipstick effect,” beauty brands have historically seen an uptick in sales of small luxuries when shoppers are tightening their belts elsewhere. So, instead of buying a big-ticket item like a car, shoppers are splurging on a $100 bottle of perfume.—MM

Irving beat out the other women daredevils in scrambling down the menacingly steep, 200-yard hill to capture a seven-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese, but not before being knocked unconscious first. The winner of the first men’s race of the day, Matt Crolla, told the AP how he prepares: “I don’t think you can train for it, can you? It’s just being an idiot.”

Racecar drivers have a blinking schedule. Formula One racers can have their eyes shut for 20 meters of driving when they blink, which is probably why they do it so selectively when behind the wheel. Unlike non-racecar driving humans who blink randomly, competitive speed demons use their eyelids <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lv?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=631236f1c841> during the same parts of each lap, researchers have discovered. Data from eye trackers attached to helmets showed that racers tend to avoid blinking while changing speed or rounding corners—they save the moistening of their corneas for straight parts of the track.

Train a dog, save a bear. As humans and bears cross paths more often, a Finnish breed of fluffy puppy is increasingly being used to save grizzlies’ lives from lethal methods of protecting people. The Karelian bear dog is made for this: They’re known for facing large mammals fearlessly and historically had been used as hunting dogs. Now, park managers and others in charge of keeping humans and wildlife safe train the canines to chase bears <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lw?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=82e4afb098f2> off of inhabited land, where they’d probably be killed if they got too close to people. Studies suggest this scare tactic is more effective than using rubber bullets or loud noises. Black bears in Lake Tahoe, California, became more nocturnal and visited urban areas less after getting scared off by a Karelian bear dog.

  TRAVEL

As lounge access has become a common credit card perk, economy travelers are gleefully repping their plastic to revel in the standard spoils of the lounge life: free buffet, open bar, strong wi-fi, and copious outlets. As a result, lounges are becoming common scenes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lA?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4ed33d470852> of mayhem reminiscent of Black Friday at Walmart, especially during peak travel times.

If you flew anywhere this weekend, you might’ve noticed overcrowding in those fancy waiting rooms or even a line to get into one. It’s possible you also spotted a legacy patron (likely a businessperson with a briefcase and a cigar) wistfully looking into the distance and remembering the times when the lounges were bastions of premium travel exclusivity.

How lounges became for the people

Back in the day, airline lounges resembled snooty gentlemen’s clubs reserved for VIP business travelers and folks willing to pay top dollar to fly first class.

Things began to change in 1985 when American Express introduced the first credit card that came with access to private clubs around the world as a way to lure traveling customers. This paved the way for the democratization of airport lounges a couple decades later as travel cards began to adopt complimentary access as a perk.

The advent of networks like Priority Pass, which began in the 1990s, and Centurion Lounges launched by American Express in 2013 allowed people to access lounges without having to commit to flying with a specific airline. These networks offer subscription plans, and some lounges allow people to enter on a pay-per-visit basis.

Many savvy travelers find a $99 annual charge and a $35 entry fee for Priority Pass to be financially prudent given how eye-poppingly high airport food prices tend to be. And options for getting in abound: Today, Nerdwallet lists 19 different cards available in the US that open lounge doors, one even coming with a no annual fee intro offer.

Meanwhile, the number of lounges has swelled to 3,000 around the globe, many of them operated not by airlines but by the credit card companies themselves. Demand for the pleasant preboarding hangout spots has far outstripped supply. And the flight delays and cancellations that have been plaguing aviation for the past couple years mean many folks are spending longer waiting around…and taking up lounge space.

But there’s a counterrevolution happening

Airlines still rely on first-class passengers for much of their revenue. As travel continues to recover from the Covid slump, these businesses need to make sure that prized customers have a superb experience not just on the plane but when they’re waiting to board—and trying to sip a preflight martini while being swarmed by sweaty plebes isn’t going to cut it.

So, companies are taking pains to make lounge air rarefied again:

* Delta announced last fall that only frequent fliers would be able to purchase Sky Club lounge privileges.

* Lounge operators are also limiting the number of hours passengers can spend in them, and beginning to charge for any guests who want to tag along.

For now…though lounges are becoming more exclusive again, travel execs are saying that this summer might be the busiest air travel season on record, so don’t expect the lounges at your local airport to stop resembling sardine cans any time soon.—SK

Robot revolution? Not quite. You can breathe a sign of relief—AI isn’t replacing your job just yet. Instead, MIT researchers are hopeful we can work collaboratively with ChatGPT, DALL-E, and more.

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Monaco and Indianapolis <#> Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc drives during the warm-up lap prior to the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Monaco street circuit in Monaco, on May 23, 2021 For the record this is in Monaco, not Indianapolis. Valery Hache/AFP via Getty Images On the surface, Monaco and Indianapolis do not have a lot in common. But when you dig deeper…okay, they still don’t have a lot in common.

So, what links this Midwestern capital with a tiny country on the French Riviera? And why are we discussing both in the same section?

Open-wheel racing is the answer

Today, Indianapolis and Monaco will host two of the most famous auto races on the calendar: The Indy 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix. Let’s “pit” the two races against each other across several categories.

Party scene: While the Indy 500 is known to have epic tailgates, Monaco has the edge because it’s synonymous with high society. A-list celebs and DJs throw exclusive parties on yachts docked at the marina, plus expensive Champagne > warm light beer.

Size: Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the largest sports facility <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lM?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2983a525c846> on the planet, with a capacity of nearly 400,000 people across the property. Meanwhile, Monaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world. No contest.

Layout: The two track layouts could not be more different. At the Indy 500, cars will zoom around a sprawling 2.5-mile oval for 200 laps. In Monaco, they’ll snake through the winding, historic streets of Monte Carlo. Although the twisty Monaco track leads to notoriously boring races, it wins for the scenic backdrop along the Mediterranean.

Speed: Both IndyCars and Formula One cars can hit ludicrous speeds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lN?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d4c100b12d1d>. The top recorded speed for an IndyCar is 236 mph, while the fastest recorded speed for an F1 car is 231.4 mph. However, F1 cars have better acceleration. This one’s a tie.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the best day of a three-day weekend: Saturday, Sunday, or Monday? Here are our favorite responses.

* “Monday, for sure. There’s nothing like setting your alarms like usual, just for the joy of waking up, smiling impishly to yourself, turning it off, and rolling over until who knows when!”—Alex from Minnesota

* “How does Friday not get any love? It’s got tThe anticipation of the long weekend ahead mixed with the excitement of the half-empty office because colleagues are either taking the day off or just leaving early anyway.”—Anonymous

* “As a full-time retail worker, very rarely do I get three days in a row off (unless I request it). So, I would say Monday, because getting regular pay on top of holiday pay makes for a happy paycheck!”—Anna from Raleigh, NC

* “Sunday. Summer = BBQ (over indirect heat, not a gas grill!), which takes hours (all day for a brisket). Start the pit, trim the brisket, drink a bloody mary (with Tito’s vodka, of course). Put the meat on the smoker, wife gets up, mimosas. Spritz the brisket and add ribs to the smoker, pop a beer. Spritz the brisket and ribs, have a beer. Wrap the ribs, have a beer. Wrap the brisket, have a beer. BBQ for dinner on Sunday, leftover BBQ on Monday...and all day Monday to relax and enjoy a cold beverage or 2.”—Mark from Missouri City, TX

This week’s question

With a busy summer travel season expected ahead of us, we want to know: What is the best car game to play during a long road trip?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “My friends play this game where someone comes up with a music category, such as ‘If your life was a movie, this song would play at the final credits,’ or ‘First dance at your wedding.’ Everyone in the car queues up a song that fits the category and we listen to all of them, all the way through.

Markets: While we’ve turned our attention to weddings, the best parties you can attend alongside your college roommate’s grandma, investors have remained focused on the negotiations for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a June 1 default.

TRENDS

More barns, less merch: How weddings are changing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jI?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Barn wedding setup <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jI?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Getty Images
Weddings reflect society. From the first sip of wine at cocktail hour to the final chorus of “Country Roads,” weddings are a showcase of our values, fashion sensibilities, food tastes, interest in religion, economic climate, and much more.

As American culture shifts, so do weddings. To understand how weddings have evolved in recent years, we turned to The Knot, a wedding site that conducted a large-scale survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jJ?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=236fe7a90c29> of couples who planned weddings in 2022.

Here’s a look at what’s trending up and trending down at weddings (promise it’s not as dramatic as this introduction).

Trending up

1. Beyond Diamonds: Lab-grown meat may be slow to take off, but lab-grown diamonds are now firmly in the mainstream. The Knot found that 36% of center stones for wedding rings were grown in a lab, double the share in 2020.

What’s behind the trend? Without complex viewing equipment, lab-grown diamonds look identical to mined diamonds, plus they don’t carry any of the ethical baggage of diamonds mined from the earth. They’re much cheaper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jK?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7f4317e34a41>, too: A 1 carat lab-grown diamond went for $1,430 earlier this year, while a similarly sized mined diamond retailed for $5,635, the WSJ reported.

2. A venue that’s a nearby barn: Almost 60% of couples chose a wedding site that was within 30 miles of where they live, while only about 20% of couples chose a destination wedding, The Knot said. Meanwhile, for the first time, barns/farms tied with banquet halls as the most popular wedding venues.

3. Signature cocktails: Forty percent of couples had a “signature cocktail” at their wedding, no doubt with names like Mai Gai or Bloody Marry Me that will make your face pucker as much as the liquor does. The share of weddings with signature cocktails has increased 17 percentage points over the last five years, The Knot said.

1. Custom merch: Couples are beginning to realize that no one wants a koozie with their wedding date on it. With custom merch headed straight to the trash can after guests return home, the ritual of handing out wedding favors has fallen by 21 percentage points in five years.

2. Wedding hashtags: #ThankGod. Born out of the need to organize wedding photos on Instagram in the early 2010s, the cringey wedding hashtag is dying a slow, punny death. Only 32% of couples created a wedding hashtag last year, down from 55% in  2017.

3. Affordability: While 38% of couples said their wedding budget/planning was impacted by the economy in 2021, that share jumped to 54% in Q4 last year as inflation spiked and made an already expensive event even more pricey. The couples surveyed by The Knot spent an average of $30,000 on their weddings last year, up $2,000 over 2021.

Other fun facts:

Ed Sheeran’s song “Perfect” was the most popular song for first dances for the sixth year in a row in 2022.

The average guest count for a wedding last year was 117.

Location matters: The average cost of a wedding in the NYC metro area was $60,000, but the average cost of a wedding in Cleveland was less than half that, at $27,000.—NF

Here in the states: Same-sex couples, married or not, now represent nearly 1% of the US’ 127 million households, according to the 2020 census. Five years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, census takers found that wedded same-sex couples accounted for 0.5% of households and unmarried same-sex partners for 0.4%.

It costs to be friends with someone in love: People are spending more money on bachelor and bachelorette parties than ever before.

In 2023, the average cost of a party was $10,800, according to the party-planning app Bach <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jR?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2b9d9bb1c557>, up from $7,700 in 2021. That puts the cost per person at ~$1,200 for a typical nine-person party.

Why? It’s a combination of longer-lasting parties and jam-packed itineraries on top of higher prices. According to Bach:

More people are opting to start their party on Thursdays instead of Fridays, adding an extra day of costs for accommodation and activities.

Boat parties and party bus tours are being booked 5x more than last year.

In a blow to the patriarchy...a 2022 survey by Savings.com <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jS?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=84b11995496b> found that bachelor party attendees shelled out more on average for every spending category, including travel, lodging, and activities, than people on a bachelorette trip. The discrepancy is likely due to bachelor parties being smaller (with fewer people to split costs) and typically featuring activities with a higher price tag, like golf and sports events.

In the same survey, 52% of people said they took on credit card debt to attend a bach party. Between drinks (~$100), hotels (~$200), and flights (~$500), it really adds up. Then again, watching your soon-to-married-friend get drunk on a Pontoon Saloon? Priceless.—CC

If you’re dying to watch someone’s drunk inlaws do the Cupid Shuffle this year, listen up: Instead of taking a platonic bestie, a mutual, or even just someone they meet at a bar, people are increasingly turning to TikTok to find a date for their friend or family member’s special day.

How it works: “In need of a +1” posts typically fall somewhere between a Survivor audition tape and a supercut of someone’s chillest moments (e.g., driving a boat, dancing at a formal function, having a dog.) Viewers whose interest is piqued by the post compete for the role of hot stranger’s date via DM or a link-in-bio survey form. The poster then sifts through a college admissions committee’s worth of applications.

Tens of thousands of people (mostly 18- to 34-year-olds) watch videos tagged with #plusone or #weddingdateapplication each day, on average, according to TikTok data.

The hashtags have garnered about 5 million views since February and 35 million since the summer of 2020.

Vegas weddings are still king…for now <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kb?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Little Vegas Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kb?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Barry Lewis/Getty Images
In September, hundreds of couples will participate in a production that’s so incredibly Vegas: The fake-tanned Dennis Bono will host <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kc?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2c66c68cb822> a mass vow renewal event at Caesars Palace to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the London Daily Herald calling the city the “Wedding Capital of the World.”

Las Vegas, which boasts over 50 wedding chapels, has been known for its campy, quick ceremonies since the city loosened marriage restrictions in the early 20th century.

In 2021, Nevada (powered by Las Vegas) had the highest rate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kd?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7651e3b6ff97> of matrimony with 26.2 new marriages per 1,000 people.

About 4% of US weddings happened in Vegas in 2021, according to Axios’s analysis of CDC data.

A Vegas wedding timeline for the rich and famous

Celebs have always supplied a steady stream of marriages for Sin City. Celebrities made Vegas weddings a thing in the ’60s, when the likes of Judy Garland, Betty White, and Frank Sinatra chose it for their second, third, or whatever number marriage they were on. But Las Vegas’s matrimonial reputation was sealed once Elvis and Priscilla Presley wed at the Aladdin Hotel in 1967.

In the mid-2000s, Vegas weddings became more associated with short-lived partnerships, micro-marriages if you will. Think Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon or Britney Spears’s infamous 55-hour marriage to Jason Alexander. Still, couples like JLo and Ben Affleck, Kourney Kardashian and Travis Barker, and Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner all opted for the “traditional” Vegas wedding within the last few years.

But it’s not all roses and fake Elvises. Despite bouncing back from pandemic lows, Vegas weddings aren’t occurring at the volume they used to. In 2004, Clark County issued some 128,000 marriage licenses, but last year it handed out just 80,000.—MM

And they lived happily ever after…but not without the help of spreadsheets, productivity tools, and G-Cal invites. For an increasing number of couples, software designed to be used at work is key to a successful marriage at home.

Many spouses are using workplace productivity tools <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k3?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c469d3c23523> to organize their relationship in what Bustle calls the “HR-ification Of Marriage,” reflecting the fact that making a marriage work can be a full-time job. In one recent popular video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k4?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=816d9137178b> on TikTok, a wife shares how she and her husband schedule a weekly admin meeting.

So, if you’re attending a wedding this summer, here’s a gift idea: a Google Docs relationship management template.

For the entrepreneurial couple selling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k5?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=217258d7be71> these templates (at a fraction of the hourly rate of even a subpar divorce lawyer), the tools are a way to feel like they’re on the same page. The anonymous duo behind the MD Meets Techie <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k6?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5a1b8d0ef20a> brand describes how productivity software Notion helps them stay on top of plans, discuss relationship values, and keep each other accountable in working toward personal goals. On a less administratively minded note, they find their shared relationship management work to be “a reminder of what we’ve experienced together as a couple.”

But many spouses are opting for spreadsheets. Whether it’s planning a cross-country move <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k7?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e481dc121f06> with the database tool Airtable or using Google Sheets to track <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k3?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f990c95c87a9> household chores, sometimes marital bliss is about adequate accounting.

For others, it’s all about proper scheduling. “If a social commitment for us or any kind event for our son doesn't make it onto G-Cal, it doesn’t happen,” says our editor Abigail Rubenstein of her nine-years-strong marriage.—SK

Good morning. If you thought you were getting ahead of the Memorial Day travel rush by flying out today…we regret to inform you that everyone else had the same idea. Today is expected to be the busiest day for air travel across the holiday weekend, with 51,194 expected flights, per the FAA.

That means opportunities to power up at the airport will be scarce, so remember to juice your laptop beforehand and maybe throw some extra cash in your carry-on to bribe the Keeper of the Outlet Hole (kid with a Nintendo Switch).

Stock spotlight: Nvidia shot up in after-hours trading after revealing that it had surpassed revenue expectations thanks to soaring demand for its chips, which are notably needed for AI. The company has added more than $220 billion to its market cap this year—that’s the value of more than one whole McDonald’s Corp.

The bird is no Fox, DeSantis disaster shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dG?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> DeSantis officially announced his 2024 bid in a Twitter Space conversation with Elon Musk. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dG?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
It was supposed to be a triumphant moment for both Ron DeSantis and Twitter CEO Elon Musk when the Florida governor officially kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign last night—not with a televised appearance, but with a Twitter Spaces event featuring the entrepreneur. Instead, it called to mind that time Musk shattered a Tesla Cybertruck’s windows onstage during a demonstration meant to show their strength.

The audio-only event was marred by repeated technical glitches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dH?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e226b41efbf> because Twitter’s servers couldn’t handle the more than 500,000 attendees listening in. At one point, the original webcast was ended and a new one was started (with fewer listeners making it in), but tech issues persisted even after that, making the world’s second- richest person look about as competent as Roman Roy.

And while half-a-million listeners sounds like a lot, it’s pretty paltry compared to the millions of viewers Fox News averages daily—plus, Fox has video!—though given how the event turned out, it may be better for DeSantis that only 250,000 people ultimately tuned in to the restarted event.

Not ready for prime time

Before the debacle, some were ready to proclaim Musk the heir <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7d3?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e518846164a> to Rupert Murdoch’s conservative media throne. It made sense: While right-wingers have recently slammed Fox for becoming too liberal for their liking, Twitter has been beefing up its conservative media bona fides:

The Daily Wire, home to polarizing figures like Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh, says it will bring its podcast videos to Twitter beginning next week.

After being dumped by Fox, Tucker Carlson announced he’ll be taking his show to Twitter.

Musk also reinstated the accounts of Fox News fan favorites Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

But the server meltdown that caused the glitches proved that Twitter’s not ready to take on Fox and friends just yet.

Bottom line: Musk is working to Make Twitter Profitable Again, but the DeSantis fiasco highlighted the site’s weaknesses.—ML, AR

The star, who began her singing career in the 1950s and remained hugely popular even as music transitioned into its MTV era in the ’80s and beyond, overcame a difficult past, including an abusive marriage to guitarist Ike Turner with whom she performed before leaving him and becoming a major solo artist.

US credit rating called into question.

It said it had put the nation’s triple-A credit rating on “rating watch negative,” meaning it’s poised for a downgrade if lawmakers can’t work things out. Even negotiations that drag on too long before a deal is reached could trigger a downgrade: That’s what happened in 2011, when S&P dinged the US’ credit over default fears. S&P still hasn’t returned the nation’s score to its highest rating.

A criminal investigation into the botched law enforcement response to the mass shooting remains ongoing, according to the Associated Press.

No one has mastered the art of the comeback quite like Abercrombie & Fitch.

The clothing retailer reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7da?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=15b5f29ac93a> impressive first quarter earnings yesterday, posting a surprise profit of $16.6 million (compared to a $16.5 million loss for the same time last year) and seeing same-store sales grow by 3%. In response, its stock jumped 31% yesterday.

The brand has come a long way: By the time former CEO Mike Jeffries was ousted from the company in 2014, Abercrombie had settled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7db?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ef895e553dec> a $50 million discrimination lawsuit, fielded sexual misconduct allegations against one of its go-to campaign photographers, and made a whole bunch of racist T-shirts. But the retail villain of the 2000s has spent almost a decade rehabbing its image.

Whatever they put in that Fierce cologne is working. The new Abercrombie, led by Fran Horowitz since 2017, is absolutely crushing it with its larger size selection and casual logo-free tops. Even as other retailers whiffed on earnings reports amid grim economic outlook, the company now expects its full-year net sales to grow 2–4% instead of its previously forecast 1–3%.

Looking ahead in fashion…watch the cargo pants space. Horowitz said the “non-denim bottom trend” is blowing up.—MM

Whatever old sunblock you have buried in the bottom of your beach bag, it may be time for an upgrade. A new report by consumer advocacy group EWG found that 75% of sunscreens <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dg?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb761ed235a8>on the shelf contain harmful ingredients.

Despite the FDA warning about 12 potentially unsafe ingredients in sunscreen back in 2019, not much has changed on the legal side since the agency says it still needs more data before it makes any decisions. The most concerning chemical, oxybenzone, is known for hormone disruption and a host of other issues, but remains legal for manufacturers to use.

Due to consumer pressure, only 6% of sunscreens contain oxybenzone today, compared to 60% in 2019, per the EWG study. Still, many of the other ingredients the FDA flagged are still widely used, including octocrylene, which becomes a carcinogen when it breaks down.

Get used to looking like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Mineral sunscreens (think zinc) are widely recommended as the safest option to avoid toxic chemicals, or check out EWG’s list of recommended safe sunscreens <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dh?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=095e9042eb10>.—CC

Stat: Asian Americans make up just 7% of the US population, but luckily for your taste buds, their cuisines are overrepresented in the restaurant business <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dl?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=93bad598c4d4>—12% of the nation’s restaurants serve Asian food of some kind and 73% of all US counties have at least one, per Pew Research. Of those, 39% feature Chinese food, with the next most popular options being Japanese food (28%) and Thai food (11%). Thailand’s presence in the top three, despite the relatively small size of the Thai American population, is partly thanks to the Thai government supporting restaurants abroad as a form of diplomacy. Your move, India. (Please! We need more dosa joints.)

Good morning. Billionaire entrepreneur Jeffrey Bezos is engaged to his girlfriend of five years, the Emmy Award-winning journalist Lauren Sanchez. Bezos reportedly popped the question in Cannes, France, on his brand-new $500 million superyacht named Koru.

Two things you should know about Koru.

It has a mermaid on its prow that resembles Sanchez.

It’s accompanied by a butler yacht, a 246-foot vessel called Abeona. Abeona carries “toys” like seaplanes, personal submarines, and sometimes helicopters, for when Koru’s passengers get bored with whatever diversions a $500 million superyacht cannot provide, the NYT reported.

Wait ’til the orcas find out about this…

Deal reached to keep the Colorado River wet, for now <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74P?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Colorado River's reservoirs are dangerously low <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74P?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Brian van der Brug/Getty Images
Three of the states that rely on the Colorado River’s dangerously dwindling water supplies have agreed to cut back their usage, which officials hope will buy enough time to find a long-term solution to the depletion of one of the country’s most relied-upon water sources.

Forty million people in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, California, Arizona, and parts of Mexico rely on the Colorado River’s flow, which has suffered roughly a 33%decrease in recent years due to chronic overuse, population growth, and historic drought. Without the river’s water stocking Lake Mead and Lake Powell, life wouldn’t be able to thrive in desert environments like Las Vegas and Phoenix.

That’s why Nevada, Arizona, and California have pledged to reduce <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74Q?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=271c604be4e9> their intake by a total of 13% over the next three years—or 3 million football fields worth of water—in exchange for $1.2 billion in federal payments.

How close is the river to drying up?

Officials have been working toward a deal since last summer, when river levels dropped enough that the hydroelectric turbines at Lake Mead and Lake Powell risked shutting down.

Lake Mead is so empty (only one-third full) that any further drop means it could become a dead pool and stop flowing to the lower basin states of Nevada, Arizona, and California.

The West’s record rain and snowfall <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74R?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=16650010ce38> this winter helped the river, and the seasonal spring runoff happening now is also a boost, but neither are enough to pull the region out of its worst drought in 1,200 years.

Meta slapped with $1.3 billion fine over data transfers.

Meta has already said it will appeal what it described as a “dangerous precedent.” The EU and the US are trying to hammer out a new deal to allow such transfers again despite the EU’s concerns that US spy agencies are given access to Europeans’ data in the States.

Talks were “productive,” but no debt ceiling deal yet.

Still, McCarthy called their discussion “productive” and “professional,” and said the tone was “better than any other time we’ve had discussions.” Before the meeting, McCarthy acknowledged that a deal must be struck this week in order to get it passed in Congress prior to the deadline, but the two sides remain far apart on the Republican’s demands for spending cuts.

The hoax image first appeared on Facebook before spreading to the bird app, where several accounts with the paid-for blue checkmarks shared it—including one calling itself Bloomberg Feed (with no relation to the actual news site) and the Russian state news outlet RT. The misinformation temporarily caused the stock market to dip, according to the actual Bloomberg.

Ozempic could be an addiction cure <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74Z?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Beaker with medicinal mixture and ozempic injection <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74Z?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Hannah Minn
The diabetes drug Ozempic, which has stirred up Real Housewives drama and won praise from celebrities for helping them lose weight, could have another welcome side effect. Some patients say it quelled their appetite for drinking, smoking, and other addictive habits, according to recent reporting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74-?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=86cd2ff948b7> by the Atlantic.

They describe simply not getting the same kick from the activities they used to crave after starting semaglutide (the generic name of the drug). One patient told Insider he went from habitually drinking eight to 10 beers at social gatherings to losing interest in alcohol beyond a couple drinks. Others found themselves kicking habits like excessive shopping, compulsively biting nails, and picking at skin.

How does it work?

Scientists say Ozempic could be rewiring the reward pathways in the brain, potentially reducing the dopamine release from consuming addictive substances.

In a recent study, researchers found that reward centers in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder who took a similar drug lit up less on fMRI scans when they saw pictures of alcohol (some of those researchers previously received funding from the company that makes Ozempic).

But for now, much of the evidence is still anecdotal.

Looking ahead…clinical trials are underway to see if semaglutide can officially be called an effective addiction cure.—SK

It’s been a while since Spitgate, so this weekend the internet found a new drama to focus on: a used sofa.

On Saturday, content creator Amanda Joy posted a TikTok <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/753?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=552947912d12> of her journey finding a blue couch on the street, cleaning it, and getting it into her apartment. Joy claims it’s the discovery of the century—the couch is allegedly a Roche Bobois “Bubble” sofa, which retails for $8,000 (though some folks believe it’s a knock-off based on the fabric).

Despite the sofa’s dubious provenance, the video of its rescue from the sidewalk has amassed nearly 50 million views since it was posted. But not everyone is psyched for Joy: There are 22,000 comments on the video, most warning that the sofa could be ground zero for a bed bug infestation.

In an informal Twitter poll with 13,766 votes, 47.8% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/754?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0251b010c3d> of people said they would not have picked up that couch off the street, and not for nothing: New York City ranks second in the US on Orkin’s Top 50 Bed Bug Cities list.

Joy posted a second video on Sunday addressing people’s concerns about the sofa, but the internet still isn’t convinced that it isn’t home to insidious critters, or at least, the ghost of a Victorian child <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/755?cid=31563841.97905&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5125f32d6fce>.—CC

But thanks to that same soaring inflation, that big bill is worth just $4 at widely used exchange rates, according to Bloomberg.

Good morning and Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day, one of my favorite holidays on the business calendar. It marks the fateful day—May 22, 2010—when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 bitcoin to buy two pizzas made by Papa John’s.

Hanyecz has said he doesn’t regret the purchase since it made him an important figure in early bitcoin history. But…c’mon, man. If he had held his 10,000 bitcoin and sold at the peak price, he’d have enough money (about $690 million) to buy 46 million Papa John’s pizzas. And even if he waited to sell his bitcoins at the current price, he could get ~$269 million for them.

Anyway, if you needed an excuse to eat pizza today (or hold onto a pipe dream), here ya go.

ECONOMY

It’s crunch time for the debt ceiling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70i?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> U.S. President Joe Biden and Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) talk as they depart the U.S. Capitol <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70i?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Drew Angerer/Getty Images
It’s understandable if you haven’t been following negotiations around the debt ceiling—it is “negotiations around the debt ceiling,” after all.

But it might be time to start paying attention, considering that the clock for the US defaulting on its debts is getting dangerously close to midnight. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70j?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=128981577d6c> yesterday that the US likely wouldn’t be able to pay all of its bills beginning next Thursday, June 1, if Congress doesn’t raise the debt ceiling from its current $31.4 trillion level by then.

What would happen? No one is quite sure…since this has never happened before. But finance experts are sure it will be extremely damaging, with the potential consequences ranging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70k?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7908832b0346> from “guaranteed recession” to “global financial market meltdown.” The size of the blast radius depends on how long a default would last, the NYT reported.

How are negotiations going?

Not great, Bob. Despite the appearance of some progress last week, the White House and Republicans remain far apart <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70l?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a58d259f5b98> on an agreement to raise the debt limit (though House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he and President Biden will meet again today).

The main sticking point: government spending.

Republicans want a debt ceiling increase paired with a decrease in nondefense federal spending, including cuts to social services.

Democrats have accused Republicans of cynically pushing the US to the financial brink to force through their cost-cutting agenda. Yesterday, Biden said the GOP’s proposal would put “food assistance at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,” calling it “extreme” and “unacceptable.”

The White House offered to freeze domestic and defense spending next year as a concession to Republicans, but they rejected that offer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70m?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e2732a7cf0ff>, according to the Washington Post. The GOP wants more than a freeze—it wants a reduction in nonmilitary spending.

The view from Wall Street

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said last week the US “probably” won’t default, but he’s assembled a “war room” of leaders who will begin to meet daily to plan contingencies just in case.

Investors seem to agree with Dimon that the bickering politicians will probably work out a solution before the deadline. The implied probability of a default in the credit default swaps market was 3.6% on Friday, compared to a peak of 6.9% during the debt ceiling standoff in 2011.

Orcas are working together to sink boats <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70t?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A pod of Killer whales or orcas (Orcinus orca) is swimming in Chatham Strait, Alaska, USA. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70t?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images
Earlier this month, a group of three orcas began to ram a yacht off the coast of Spain, eventually piercing its rudder and causing it to sink.

It was not an isolated incident. This was the third boat sunk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70u?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4ed2741f92bf> by orcas on Europe’s Iberian coast since 2020, and appears to be a part of a growing, coordinated effort by the killer whales to attack ships in the area, according to Live Science.

Why? In a surprising discovery, scientists think the behavior started with one orca and spread across the population. It’s believed that a female orca named White Gladis experienced a “critical moment of agony,” such as getting tangled in illegal fishing gear, which turned her against boats. Because orcas are social creatures that imitate each other (relatable), other killer whales in the population started to copy White Gladis and ram into boats, specifically to damage the rudder.

Big picture: Since 2020, when the orca attacks started to ramp up, the vast majority of their encounters with boats in the region have been harmless, biologist Alfredo López Fernandez told Live Science. Still, the increasing frequency of ramming attacks threatens the safety of sailors and the subpopulation of orcas off the Iberian coast, which are critically endangered.

That’s the most ever paid for a house in California <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70z?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ab01ba7e8948> and the second-highest price for a home in US history, after Ken Griffin’s purchase of a New York City apartment for $238 million. So, what do you get for $200 million? A 30,000 square-foot mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean with a minimalist design resembling a supervillain’s hideout.

Quote: “Just being able to hear my national anthem, see my flag, I definitely wanted to stand.”

Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner explained to The Atlantic why she stood <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70A?cid=31552901.2890377&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=dfae844bc7d5> for the US national anthem before her team’s WNBA season opener on Friday night. Since 2020, Griner chose not to stand for the anthem to protest racial injustice against Black Americans. But after her experience being locked in a cage in Russia, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” Griner said, “just means a little bit more to me now” and represents the freedom Americans have to speak out.

If the pony favored to win today’s Preakness Stakes does in fact stand in the winner’s circle, he’s bringing a huge crowd with him. That’s because Mage, the frontrunner and Kentucky Derby champion, is partly owned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_P?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=787cfdee85c9> by the sports investment startup called Commonwealth that offers its users the chance to own an even smaller piece of the thoroughbred.

How it works: Commonwealth is an app that lets anyone with at least $50 buy shares that back racehorses and golfers. Users get payouts from race purses and tournament earnings. According to Front Office Sports, the app bought 25% of Mage, whose value ballooned to over $5 million post-Derby, for an initial investment of $170,000. That value is disbursed to the 390 people who bought shares in Mage via Commonwealth before the Derby.

Anything could happen, but Mage is the only Kentucky Derby participant that will be competing in Baltimore today and still in the running for the Triple Crown. If he clinches that, Commonwealth’s stake will be worth $25 million, per FOS.

Big picture: Commonwealth is one of several startups and apps that have popped up in the last few years offering fractional shares in everything from real estate to fine art that let retail traders get a small piece of asset usually reserved for big spenders.—MM

SCIENCE

New York City is going down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_T?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York sinking under water <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_T?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Alyssa Nassner
New York is sinking under its own weight, sliding deeper into the Earth’s crust at an average rate of 1–2 millimeters a year, according to the latest research <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_U?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2b446b14d98c>.

The Big Apple’s most iconic features are partly to blame: The massive skyscrapers and densely clustered buildings (collectively weighing 1.7 trillion tons) apply too much pressure to the ground. Ironically, many of the skyscrapers are now empty, as remote work pushed office vacancy rates to a record 22.7% this year, per Bloomberg.

The researchers’ weighty findings signal danger for the coastal metropolis. Four of its five boroughs are mostly located on islands, and New York’s descent puts some neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding as sea levels rise. Flooding and damage from two major hurricanes since 2012 has already cost billions of dollars to repair.

But it’s too early to start calling the Big Apple the Big Atlantis... engineering hacks can prevent sinking cities from becoming neighbors of Bikini Bottom even as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of storms. New York is rebuilding a park on Manhattan’s East Side to make the neighborhood more flood-proof, and last year it changed building codes to improve drainage.—SK

Key performance indicators <#> A Louise Bourgeois Spider sculpture Sotheby’s
Stat: Fast talkers with hammers have been crushing it lately: Auction records are getting shattered all over the place. Yesterday, Sotheby’s announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_Y?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e18eceedeab6> that a 10-foot-high spider sculpture by Louise Bourgeois sold for $32.8 million—the most ever for a sculpture made by a woman artist. Meanwhile, Christie’s sale of the late Austrian philanthropist Heidi Horten’s jewelry <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6_Z?cid=31543259.2875175&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6e764a0cd0af> raked in $202 million, taking the crown for biggest jewelry auction from the $137 million sale of Elizabeth Taylor’s bling. The sale succeeded despite controversy: Horten’s husband built his fortune in part by taking over Jewish-owned businesses during the Nazis’ rise.

Like Indy, Ford didn’t waste time on modesty, but the actor did mention that he does a lot of cycling.

The future of cable is in ESPN’s hands <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VM?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Old TV with ESPN logo on floor with the Disney logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VM?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Cable may be going on its Derek Jeter farewell tour sooner than we thought. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported fresh details <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VN?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a0b0cc4ee41a> about ESPN’s long-awaited plan to launch a stand-alone streaming service—a move that could spell doom for cable given the network’s outsized role in keeping cable’s remaining customers from cutting the cord.

The push into streaming, reportedly dubbed “Flagship” internally at ESPN’s parent company Disney, has been the industry’s worst-kept secret for years. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro called the direct-to-consumer shift a matter of when, not if, in an interview <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VO?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e5bdca206152> with Bloomberg earlier this month.

But it looks like that “when” isn’t far downfield, as ESPN execs have started brokering deals with cable providers and sports leagues to allow programming to be offered via streaming, according to the WSJ.

Doesn’t ESPN already have a streaming option?

Yes, ESPN+, which it launched in 2018. But this new service would be much more comprehensive than ESPN+, offering the network’s full spectrum of broadcasting that is not available on its current streaming platform. For example, last night ESPN+ showed the South Alabama vs. Arkansas State college baseball game, while ESPN proper broadcast the Lakers vs. Nuggets NBA playoff matchup.

Still, there’s a reason ESPN has been cautious in moving its network to the streaming arena. Cable, while on the decline, is a more reliable business, and ESPN makes a boatload of money on linear TV.

ESPN can charge pay-TV providers over $9/month per subscriber, per Bloomberg.

ESPN+ brings in $5.53.

But cord-cutters are gonna cut cords, and Disney’s traditional TV networks, of which ESPN is the golden child, brought in only $1.8 billion in income last quarter, down from $2.8 billion the quarter before that, per the WSJ. So you don’t have to be a media mogul to understand that the move to make ESPN streamable is “inevitable,” CEO Bob Iger said this month.

Bottom line: With live sports serving as the marquee attraction for cable, industry execs predict that ESPN’s total embrace of streaming will be the knockout blow that takes out linear TV.—CC, NF

Disney scraps a nearly $1 billion project. Can you guess where? Yep, it’s in Florida, where the company has caught flak from Gov. Ron DeSantis. Citing “changing business conditions” (but not DeSantis explicitly), Disney parks chair Josh D’Amaro announced that Disney was canceling plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VS?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f7a6953519f> for a new corporate campus in Orlando that would have moved more than 2,000 jobs to the area. Disney also said it was shutting down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VT?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a458e7b80177> its luxury hotel at Walt Disney World, the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.

The ChatGPT app functions similarly to the existing browser design (free, no ads), but OpenAI hopes that by making ChatGPT easily accessible on your phone, you’ll end up using it more—and Google Search less.

More Americans are getting high at work.

The drug-testing lab screened more than 6 million employees for pot following on-the-job accidents, and 4.3% came back positive, a bump from 3.9% in 2021. Quest attributes the jump in positive tests to the wave of marijuana legalization efforts across the country, but warned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VW?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=018e6109f59d> that getting high on the job, which can slow reaction time and impact memory, can “have a major impact on safety at work.”

JFK’s nephew, the author of Moneyball, and a robotic bull all walk into an event space—and it’s not that crowded.

The third annual bitcoin industry conference is underway in Miami with less than half as many attendees as last year’s 35,000-person turnout. The three-day event <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6W2?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cdd3d32c257a>—with speeches from presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and writer Michael Lewis—is likely drawing smaller crowds because of “crypto winter”: the recent crypto failures (shoutout FTX) dampening enthusiasm for digital coins.

Rewind to the pandemic...and Miami was going all-in on crypto: It built a Transformer-looking version <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6W3?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2dffd05677d6> of Wall Street’s Charging Bull, its bitcoin-salaried mayor labeled it the “crypto capital of the world,” and the city even rolled out a (now defunct) digital currency, MiamiCoin.

Fast forward to 2023...and the crypto fever might have passed. Still, Will Smith’s favorite city is showing it doesn’t need bitcoin to thrive.

Even as spiking mortgage rates took a bite out of home prices across the country this year, Miami-Dade County’s median home price grew by about 5%.

Unlike other American downtowns, Miami offices have a relatively low vacancy rate, largely thanks to Florida’s low corporate tax.

Ketchup hasn’t seen innovation like this since the first brave soul hit the 57. Kraft Heinz’s newest invention <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VY?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ae3c18c662f7>, the Heinz Remix, is a dispenser that lets you get lost in the customization of your sauce.

How it works: First, you choose one of four base sauces—ketchup, ranch, 57 sauce, or BBQ. Then, you can select flavor “enhancers” such as jalapeño, smoky chipotle, buffalo, and/or mango, and decide the level of intensity. Similar to the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines you see in movie theaters, the Heinz Remix will dispense whatever deranged concoction you can come up with.

Will everything faintly taste like buffalo? We’ll have to see. The food giant will demo the prototype machine at this weekend’s National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago and intends to start putting the machines in restaurants as soon as this year.

The business case: Kraft Heinz isn’t just launching the Remix so teens can make the ultimate graveyard sauce to drink on dares. It’s hoping the machine will help identify what new sauce combos consumers actually want—and add more fuel to its growing food service division. The company has recently made big investments outside your fridge. It closed a deal to put Lunchables in school cafeterias <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6VZ?cid=31530635.2908297&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=84f1ccaf6fe6> and released a line of professional mayo for chefs.—MM

Publisher Penguin Random House and advocacy group PEN America sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6M-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> a Florida school district yesterday over book bans, joining Disney in pushing back against the state’s “anti-woke” policies that critics say censor free speech and infringe on civil rights.

The details: PEN America, Penguin, and five authors of banned books filed a federal lawsuit against the Escambia County School District and School Board, claiming they violated the First Amendment by banning 10 books from its school libraries. The suit also alleges the groups violated the constitutional equal protection clause because most of the books targeted included themes of race, sexuality, or gender.

A number of books including George M. Johnson’s All Boys Aren’t Blue, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, and Judy Blume’s Forever… were challenged by one single language arts teacher, according to the suit. And it claims that despite a review committee ruling the books were OK for young readers, the school board still removed them. The lawsuit wants the banned books back in libraries. Escambia County School District has declined to comment.

What’s so special about Escambia County’s book bans? PEN America said this specific school district has attempted to ban or restrict almost 200 books.

It’s also in Florida…

...which has been churning out laws restricting what educators can say and teach, including at the collegiate level <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6M_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628>. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president, signed four bills limiting LGBTQ+ rights yesterday, one of which expanded the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law to prohibit teachers from discussing gender or sexual orientation with students through eighth grade (up from third grade).

That’s the law at the center of the bitter dispute between Disney and DeSantis. Disney, one of the biggest private employers in Florida, criticized the legislation and has sued DeSantis over what it called an “anti-business, and patently unconstitutional” effort by the governor to punish Disney for its criticism.

Looking ahead…it remains to be seen whether DeSantis’s spat with Disney and his broader “anti-woke” agenda will be popular among voters as he gears up to run for president. He took an L this week when Jacksonville, the largest city in Florida, elected a Democrat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> as its next mayor over DeSantis’s candidate.—MM

Tour de headlines TikTok lock ban bad Francis Scialabba
Montana bans TikTok. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a law that makes Montana the first US state <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> to comprehensively ban the Chinese-owned app. While other states have banned TikTok on government-issued devices over national security concerns, Montana’s law blocks the app from operating inside its borders and penalizes app stores from making TikTok available for download in Montana. The ban goes into effect on Jan. 1, but you can bet opponents (like TikTok and free speech advocates) will take Montana to court over this major escalation.

Things are about to get heated. The World Meteorological Organization estimates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> that there’s a 66% chance the world will experience warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, at least temporarily, by 2027. The number has long been considered a breaking point for keeping climate change in check. The group expects that the extra heat from the natural El Niño weather phenomenon coupled with human-caused warming will likely make the next five years the hottest on record.

Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Markle’s mom were involved in a “near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi” for over two hours on Tuesday night after leaving a gala in New York City, according to the couple’s spokesperson. As the news hit yesterday morning, everyone was reminded of the paparazzi chase that Harry blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana.

But police painted a different picture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N8?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> than the “near catastrophic” episode described by Harry and Meghan. The NYPD said that there were no collisions or injuries reported, while police sources told ABC that the amount of paparazzi involved was not at the levels described by the couple’s spokesperson.

At one point in the night, the couple got into a taxi. The driver didn’t feel threatened by the photographers: He told the Washington Post <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> that his passengers “were quiet and seemed scared, but it’s New York—it’s safe.”

Prince Harry versus the tabloids

This isn’t the only tangle Harry has going on with the tabloids. He and Meghan are actively involved in three lawsuits against newspapers in the UK, alleging unlawful information gathering via phone hacking.

And Harry is serious about controlling the narrative: He’s expected to testify in court next month. The last time a senior member of the royal family appeared in court was in 1891, when Edward VII served as a witness to an alleged card-cheating scandal.—CC

CRISPR lettuce for your summer salad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Nd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Scientists at Pairwise have gene-edited mustard greens to be less bitter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Nd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Hannah Minn
Genetically edited mustard greens are coming for the salad base throne thanks to scientists who have figured out how to remove the trait that makes the nutritious vegetable taste so bitter.

The new and improved milder mustard greens from agriculture startup Pairwise will be the first food on the US market to have been tweaked using the revolutionary gene-editing tool CRISPR. The modified greens are already being served in a few restaurants and will begin hitting grocery stores this summer.

But you probably won’t know they’re anything special from the packaging. Unlike GMO foods that bend the laws of nature by incorporating genes from other species, gene-edited foods contain modified versions of their own genes, so the USDA doesn’t require the “bioengineered” label it slaps on GMOs.

The logic is that gene-editing merely speeds up a process that can occur naturally: Rather than using the centuries-old crossbreeding methods that can take a decade to alter traits, scientists used CRISPR to directly edit the mustard greens DNA for debittered lettuce in just four years, according to Wired <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ne?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628>.

New priorities: Until recently, gene editing and genetic modification had been used mainly to boost crop yields. Mustard greens 2.0 is all about getting consumers to substitute iceberg and other nutrient-lacking lettuce for a more nutritional vegetable.—ML

An official union vote count is scheduled for today after the club’s management agreed to stop opposing it, leaving the dancers poised to join the 51,000-member Actors’ Equity Association.

The Anarchist, a Toronto coffee shop that opened in March 2022 and billed itself as an “anti-capitalist, anti-colonial cafe, shop, and radical community space on stolen land,” plans to close <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Nj?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> at the end of the month. Its owner said the anti-capitalist cafe suffered from the most capitalist of headaches: not bringing in enough cash.

Markets: Stocks took a hit from disappointing retail sales data and, you’re never going to believe this, ongoing concerns about smashing through the debt ceiling. However, Capital One got a boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> after Warren Buffett said it’s in his wallet. Buffett’s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, has taken a nearly $1 billion stake in the bank, according to a Tuesday filing.

Debt ceiling update: Progress, maybe? After more negotiations, GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said a deal to raise the debit limit was “possible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ka?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432>” by the end of the week, while President Biden is leaving his upcoming trip to Asia earlier than planned to push through an agreement.

 

TECH

AI is in its regulation era <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Sam Altman at Senate hearing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Win McNamee/Getty Images
Typically when a tech CEO goes in front of a Senate committee, they end up explaining how to use email. Not so yesterday, when Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, testified <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> on Capitol Hill on the future of AI and how the field should be regulated.

What happened at the hearing? Setting an ominous tone for what was to come, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, read opening remarks that he later revealed were created by AI. The hearing continued with a discussion of the dangers presented by an unpredictable, evolving technology that can create and spread misleading information without us even realizing it (looking at you, drippy pope).

Lawmakers acknowledged past failures to implement timely regulation for advances in technology. Sen. Blumenthal said, “Congress failed to meet the moment on social media,” and hinted at wanting to avoid the same mistake again.

Regulating AI is like herding kittens on rollerskates Experts don’t agree on what regulation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> should look like for AI because it’s evolving much faster than other technologies. And moving quickly (or at all) isn’t exactly Congress’s strong suit, so it’s unclear whether traditional lawmaking can keep up with the regulation of a technology that is constantly changing.

But they’ll try. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is working alongside experts to create a framework that focuses on transparency within AI models. It would require that models disclose who trained them and their data sources, but the proposal will likely face resistance from AI companies.

Altman, who warned “if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” is also in favor of regulation—but came with his own ideas. He advocated for the creation of a new government agency with the power to license large AI models, create and monitor safety standards, and conduct independent audits. But he did not mention requiring transparency around model training or source data.

Looking ahead…expect the regulation talk to heat up as both Congress and tech leaders try to figure out how to manage the existential risk posed by AI.—CC

San Antonio won the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes. The Spurs were victorious <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Kb?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> in the 2023 NBA Draft lottery, meaning they’ll have the right to select French basketball phenom Victor Wembanyama, who’s regarded as the best NBA prospect since LeBron James. Wenbanyama combines a 7-foot-5 frame with skills no player of his height should have, like smooth handles and a 3-point-shot.

A new feature <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> debuting this year for Apple devices will allow you to create a digital version of your own voice to use to speak with anyone you’d like.

The Personal Voice feature is one of several forthcoming accessibility features that Apple unveiled yesterday. It’s meant to aid people with conditions such as ALS that put them at risk of losing their ability to speak.

Apple promises that after spending just 15 minutes reading text prompts into an iPhone or iPad, your digital voice will be ready to go. Another new feature, Live Speech, will let a device read messages you type.

But…what’s to prevent someone from stealing your voice like Ursula the sea witch? In a world where AI can produce a “Drake” bop <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FF?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> and perhaps extend Tom Hanks's acting career long after his death (according to Tom Hanks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432>), it’s reasonable to be concerned about facilitating deepfakes of yourself. But Apple claims the feature will rely on “on-device machine learning to ensure user privacy,” so your voice won’t be waiting in the cloud for hackers.—AR

Taco Bell wants to free T*co T*esday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Taco out of open cage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Francis Scialabba
Normally the villain of your insides, Taco Bell is trying to be a hero by freeing the name “Taco Tuesday” from its IP prison. The fast-food chain filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> a petition yesterday to cancel the trademark of the phrase owned by a smaller taco chain, Taco John’s.

Taco John’s, maker of the also-trademarked Potato Olés, has owned the trademark on Taco Tuesday in 49 states since 1989 and has not been shy about sending cease-and-desist letters to anyone who tries to use it to promote tacos…on Tuesday.

In the one state where Taco John’s doesn’t have the trademark—New Jersey—a restaurant and bar called Gregory’s owns it. Taco Bell filed to Baja blast away Gregory’s trademark as well.

The creators of the Crunchwrap Supreme (also trademarked) said in a press release that the phrase “should belong to all who make, sell, eat and celebrate tacos”—so it won’t be seeking damages or future trademarking of the phrase on its own. In response, Taco John’s announced…a Taco Tuesday deal.

Could Taco Bell win this thing? In 2019, LeBron James tried to trademark Taco Tuesday, and the US Patent and Trademark Office rejected his app, saying that the phrase was just too common (thereby kind of admitting no company should hold a trademark on it). Taco Bell might be hoping this precedent will work in its favor, but it will likely be a couple years until the beef is resolved.—MM

According to a new survey from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the share of American job seekers who relocated for a new position dropped to a record low of 1.6% in Q1 of 2023.

Good morning. Yesterday, Sports Illustrated announced that 81-year-old Martha Stewart will appear on one of the covers of this year’s Swimsuit Issue, making her the oldest SI Swimsuit cover model ever. Between this and hard-launching Pete Davidson’s current relationship, Stewart is having a productive 2023.

Fun fact: Which model did Stewart dethrone as the oldest SI cover star? Maye Musk, who appeared on last year’s cover at age 74. Yes, that’s Elon Musk’s mom.

ECONOMY

Ballooning consumer debt isn’t deflating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> Credit card that is being blown up with a bike pump <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> Hannah Minn
If you’ve been dropping plastic a lot and hoping it’ll take care of itself later, join the club. Yesterday, the New York Fed released its Q1 report on household debt: Findings include a record-high debt level of $17 trillion, persistent credit card debt, and rising delinquency rates.

A typical first quarter sees credit card balances decline as people pay off what they spent over the holidays while trying to out-gift their in-laws. But, for the first time in 20 years, that isn’t the case, according to Bloomberg. Balances remained flat over Q1, suggesting that people aren’t cutting back and are probably using credit cards to finance daily spending due to the rising cost of…pretty much everything.

It’s not just that credit card balances are flat. Delinquency is rising, as is its intimidating older brother, serious delinquency, which is when a debt is 90+ days past due. The Fed’s report showed that 4.57% of credit card debt transitioned to serious delinquency last quarter, up from 3.04% in Q1 of 2022. And for credit card holders aged 18–29, 8.3% of balances were in serious delinquency.

Plastic isn’t the only thing to blame In addition to causing lots of folks to check their credit card balance real quick, the report had a few key takeaways:

Auto loan delinquencies are higher than they were before the pandemic for those under 40. The average monthly car payment is $729.

Mortgage debt increased by $121 billion in the first quarter, reaching a $12.04 trillion balance, likely as a result of the Fed’s rate increase extravaganza.

Student debt saw a slight decrease in the rate of serious delinquency, which went down to less than 1%—but that’s probably because repayment is paused for now.

Zoom out: Debt balances are almost $3 trillion higher than pre-pandemic, but Fed analysts see an upside; many households are still more financially stable than they were before thanks to the mortgage refi boom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BU?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> of 2020–2021 when rates were at their lowest.—CC

The ultimate gaming power-up isn’t gold coins or the ability to see through dungeon walls. It’s realism—that feeling that you are inside the game.

And that’s just what Virtuix <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431&lp=text1> has done with their omnidirectional VR gaming treadmill: the Omni One <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431&lp=text2>. It’s designed to fit in your living room *and* offer unrestricted freedom of movement.

Sounds next level, right? Yep, but let’s one-up things. You can invest in Virtuix’s game-changing VR treadmill today <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431&lp=text3> (and join Mark Cuban and other prominent investors).

Virtuix has already raised over $35m. And if you add to that by investing just $1k, you’ll get 30% off your very own Omni One treadmill. That’s a $780 value.

Let’s recap: Invest $1k in Virtuix and save 780 bucks on your very own Omni One, but only until May 18. Invest here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431&lp=text4>.

Tour de headlines Illustration of a Call of Duty skeleton with Microsoft logo in his eyes Illustration: Dianna “Mick” McDougall, Photo: Call of Duty/Activision
At least the EU likes Microsoft’s $69b deal to buy Activision. In a win Microsoft needed to keep its deal with Activision alive, EU antitrust regulators gave its efforts to acquire the Call of Duty-maker the green light <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> yesterday. But Microsoft still has an uphill battle to get the deal through antitrust watchdogs in the UK and the US. UK regulators rejected the deal last month, and yesterday criticized the fixes accepted by its EU counterpart. And in the States, the FTC has sued to block it.

FBI comes under fire for Trump-Russia probe. Trump-appointed Special Counsel John Durham has finally released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> his report on the agency’s probe into allegations linking former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign to Russia, and he concluded that the investigation should never have happened. The 306-page report states that the agency rushed into the investigation based on “raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,” while being much more cautious regarding claims against Hillary Clinton. The report is unlikely to end partisan fighting over the issue, especially since Durham’s four years of work yielded few court victories.

Vice Media filed for bankruptcy. The company, which was valued at $5.7 billion in 2017, filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Co?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday and plans to sell itself to a group of creditors for $225 million. It’s the latest in a string of digital media companies to stumble recently after advertising revenue became harder to come by. Vice’s filing was also one of seven large companies to head to bankruptcy court in a 48 hour period—marking the largest number of filings during a two-day period since 2008, according to Bloomberg.

There’s a lot brewing with OpenAI founder Sam Altman besides ChatGPT as he comes for Elon Musk’s No. 1 billionaire-innovator spot. He’s about to secure <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6B_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> a $100 million funding round for an eye scan-enabled global cryptocurrency, worldcoin, according to the Financial Times.

It’s not totally unrelated to his signature project: Worldcoin’s goal is to verify whether users are human by scanning their irises to disburse universal basic income...to workers displaced by AI.

Finding investors for a crypto startup during crypto winter is just one of Altman’s side projects. The venture capitalist’s resume increasingly looks like a cyberpunk manga.

The Altman-backed nuclear fission startup, Helion Energy, recently notched a deal to supply electricity to Microsoft in 2028, even though most experts say that timeline for making the tech work is a long shot.

But so is expanding the average human lifespan by 10 years, a research effort by Retro Biosciences, which the serial entrepreneur plugged with $180 million.

Zoom out: This may all sound like the beginning of a dystopian sci-fi scenario, but Altman claims he’s aware of the potential dangers of his ventures and is concerned with more than just profit. Still, some worry that he won’t be able to build technology at a breakneck pace without unleashing chaos.—SK

Whoever has been making sacrifices to the free television gods just got their prayers answered. The hardware startup Telly is giving away 500,000 55-inch 4K flat-screens at no cost to your wallet.

But, like most free things, the TV comes with a catch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431>: constant advertisements and data collection.

A never-ending ad stream will live on the dual-screen TV’s lower “Smart Screen,” a nine-inch addendum that can also show weather, stocks, and other widgets. The main screen might also display ads when you’re not using it.

You’ll also have to answer some demographic and psychographic questions when you sign up to make the ads more targeted: “If Toyota wants to run an ad to people that currently own a Honda whose lease expires within the next 12 months, we pick and choose those individual TVs,” Telly co-founder Ilya Pozin, who also co-founded Pluto TV, told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> the Hollywood Reporter.

If you’re okay with all that, you can reserve a free TV on Telly’s website <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431>. They’re expected to ship this summer.

Zoom out: Marketers say it was only a matter of time before a free TV emerged, since prices for devices like Roku and smart TV sets have been coming down as ad sales have grown. Ad spending for internet-connected TVs rose from about $6 billion in 2019 to more than $21 billion in 2022, according to Statista.—ML

Key performance indicators An image from the Netflix show Queen Cleopatra Queen Cleopatra/Netflix
Stat: Netflix’s Queen Cleopatra was in the streamer’s top 10 television show yesterday, but any success came in spite of the show’s audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. The series, which debuted last week, had a 1% audience <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ca?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> score over the weekend before ticking up to 2% yesterday with 2,500+ reviews in (by contrast, the Elizabeth Taylor version blamed for destroying multiple marriages has a 68% audience score). But the barrage of negative reviews likely stems as much from the backlash against the casting of a Black British woman as the iconic Egyptian queen as from anything to do with the Jada Pinkett Smith-produced series—though its score from professional critics is only 11%.

And he’s not about to surface any time soon—he plans to spend 100 days there to complete his research. But despite ascribing to the philosophy that it’s better down where it’s wetter, Dituri admitted he misses seeing the sun rise. He doesn’t miss class, though—he’s still teaching online.

Markets: Despite the risk of the US defaulting on its debts next month, equity investors have kept calm and carried on <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ww?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>, sending the Nasdaq to a weekly gain last week. But over in the bond market, investors are sweating. The cost of credit-default swaps, which act as insurance over a default, is higher in the US than in emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil.

GEOGRAPHY

The suburbs are buzzing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> Suburban mall in Virginia <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> Robert Knopes/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
Have a few morning meetings, hit a Sweetgreen for lunch, finish up work, then go see your favorite band play a show—sounds like a day you could only pull off in a city.

Not anymore. As Axios reported, the rise of remote work has breathed new life <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> into America’s suburbs, drowning out the roar of leaf blowers with commercial growth, an influx of new residents, and increased cultural opportunities, like legitimately good restaurants <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>.

Retailers show the way

You’ve read headlines about major retailers closing stores in downtowns. But the reverse is happening in the suburbs, where retailers are opening new locations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to meet customers where they live and, increasingly, work. The availability of urban retail topped suburban availability in the second half of last year for the first time since at least 2013, the WSJ reported citing CBRE data.

Case study: Sweetgreen.

In 2019, 35% of Sweetgreen’s real estate footprint was in the suburbs.

As of last summer, half of its locations are rockin’ the suburbs.

Even suburban malls, which have been given their last rites for decades, appear to be recuperating. Shopping center landlords are setting leasing and occupancy records this year, according to the WSJ.

A trickle into a flood

The US suburban population had been increasing before the pandemic, growing 10.5% between 2010 and 2020, according to the Census. But lawns and patios became even more attractive during Covid, and the desire to live your best North Caldwell life has stuck around post-pandemic. Nearly half of millennials surveyed in a recent Bank of America report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> (43%–45%) said they expected to buy a house in the suburbs.

And as the suburbs have ballooned, they look a lot less like Leave It to Beaver. The populations of big American suburbs are now more diverse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> than the broader US population, according to Brookings.

Bottom line: The WFH-enabled rise of the suburbs may serve as a wake-up call <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to cities, where, in the case of NYC, 26 Empire State Buildings’-worth of office space now sits empty. According to Stanford’s Nicholas Bloom, the typical office worker is spending $2,000–$4,600 less annually in city centers.

​​ Turkish election is headed for a runoff. In the country’s most consequential election in a generation, neither the authoritarian-leaning incumbent, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, nor his challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu eclipsed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wI?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> the 50% threshold needed for victory, so the two men will likely square off in a runoff scheduled for May 28. If it’s anything like yesterday’s first round, it will be tense: Both candidates said the others’ vote counts were not to be trusted.

Sweden wins Eurovision. The Eurovision-obsessed country took home the top prize with Loreen’s performance of the power ballad “Tattoo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wJ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>.” An estimated 160+ million people tuned into the famously over-the-top singing event, which took place in Liverpool, England, on behalf of last year’s winner, Ukraine (the show featured numerous tributes to Ukraine). Sweden’s win means it’ll host next year’s competition on the 50th anniversary of the most iconic Eurovision performance of all time: ABBA singing “Waterloo.”

Ja Morant suspended again. The Memphis Grizzlies star has been suspended <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wK?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> from all team activities after he appeared to be holding a gun on an Instagram livestream this weekend. It’s the second time in just over two months that Morant was suspended for seeming to hold a gun in a social media video. After the first incident, in March, Morant was suspended for eight games and lost out on $668,000 of his salary. When returning from that suspension, Morant said he sought counseling to help him better deal with stress.

Five years ago yesterday, the Supreme Court lifted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wM?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> a federal ban on sports gambling in the US, spawning a multibillion-dollar industry that’s transformed how Americans watch, talk about, and experience sports.

We plucked five numbers from the sports betting world to highlight five years of legalization.

$95 billion: That’s how much Americans bet on sports in legal jurisdictions with consumer protections last year, Sportico reported. It’s more money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wN?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> than the amount spent on ride sharing, coffee, and streaming.

71%: Two sports betting companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, control more than 70% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wO?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> of the US market, per gambling analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik. But despite taking in ~10% of wagers, these companies have struggled to turn a profit. FanDuel recorded its first quarterly profit last year, and DraftKings has yet to report a profitable quarter.

33: That’s the number of states, not including Washington, DC, that currently have legal sports betting. Another four states have legalized sports wagering, but don’t have any sportsbooks operating yet.

3: The three most-populous US states—California, Texas, and Florida—have not legalized sports gambling. They account for 26% of all teams in the major North American pro leagues, according to Axios.

45%: The number of women joining sportsbook apps jumped 45% last year, marking the third straight year that new women users exceeded men. Plus, the amount bet on women’s sports in 2022 increased 61% annually on DraftKings.

If you go, you’ll catch new films from Wes Anderson and Martin Scorcese, but don’t try to protest: The region’s government has banned all types of demonstrations amid heightened tensions over France raising the retirement age.

Quote: “I do not understand what is happening but I am incomprehensibly grateful to bigolas dickolas.”

It’s quite reasonable that writer Amal El-Mohtar doesn’t understand what is happening, because it is strange. A book she co-authored in 2019, This is How You Lose the Time War, has shot up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to the top 10 on Amazon’s bestseller list thanks to a tweet by an account called Bigolas Dickolas Wolfwood.

The financial dangers of looking on the sunny side. Spring is here, the sun is shining—and new research shows that’s likely to affect the stock market. A study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> that examined the weather’s impact on Chinese investors’ behavior in auction-style secondary equity offerings found that on days investors needed sunglasses, they were more optimistic and less risk-averse, driving bidding up and discounts down. Even one standard deviation in either sunshine intensity or duration made a noticeable difference. This adds to previous studies that found sunlight is associated with higher market returns and that fall and winter IPOs get priced lower.

Learn how to catcall more effectively. Cats are notoriously fickle, but French scientists have determined the best way to call <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> an unfamiliar cat to you and actually get it to come is by using a combination of audio and visual cues (rather than just one or the other). If you have to pick just one, a purely visual summoning gets a quicker feline response than a solely vocal one. The researchers discovered all this by testing out techniques on kitties from a cat cafe.

Get ready for Smell-O-Vision. One quick way to tell whether you’re in a VR simulation or the real world is to ask yourself whether things have scents. But that might change now that scientists have developed more efficient systems for integrating smell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ux?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> into the virtual world. Previous efforts involved messy aerosols and bulked-up headsets, but the new scent delivery method works by heating wax, so the user needs just a small under-nose patch or soft mask. The researchers have made 30 smells so far, including stinky durian fruit, and testers identifying them had a 93% success rate.—AR

  NEWS ANALYSIS

Santiago/New York Times Staff/Getty Images Can you guess what “one of the tech industry’s worst mistakes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6u_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781>” is, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman?

It’s not Quibi. It’s buying into the idea that 100% remote work wouldn’t cost startups creativity, as he recently said at an event organized by payment company Stripe.

The OpenAI CEO is the latest tech exec to argue that an 8:57am wake-up call and leisurely cold brew in bed might not be the optimal Tuesday morning routine for tech workers, despite many leaders having once hailed WFH as the way of the future.

Then vs. now

When the pandemic shut down the world, many tech leaders were quick to proclaim a permanent WFH revolution. But now, one after another, Silicon Valley bosses are trading remote work evangelism for remote work frustration, citing productivity concerns.

Here are a few examples.

Meta: In May 2020, Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6v0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> he wanted to mold Facebook into “the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale.” In the first months of the pandemic, he said employees could apply to make their job permanently remote and predicted that half of the company could work off-site in 5–10 years.

Fast forward to 2023: Zuck is saying that in-person engineers “get more done” and that Meta is reevaluating its distributed team approach.

Salesforce: In 2021, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff was seemingly at peace with the idea of never again seeing his company’s glitzy SF skyscraper bustling with workers. “They’re mostly at home, and that’s fine,” he said then.

Now, it might not be fine after all: Late last year, he wondered in an internal Slack if the “much lower productivity” of employees hired during the pandemic is “a reflection of our office policy,” according to CNBC.

What changed?

The US is experiencing the biggest decline in worker productivity since 1948, according to research from EY-Parthenon, and many executives have been quick to single out remote work as the main culprit.

This is what they cite to prove their point.

* A study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> published in Nature Human Behaviour found that working remotely made Microsoft’s remote workers miss important learning opportunities by not rubbing elbows with coworkers who aren’t part of their immediate team.

* More recent research <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> showed that interacting through a screen can make workers less likely to generate ideas. That’s a problem for tech companies needing to out-innovate the competition.

For many industry leaders, accessing a wider talent pool outside of traditional tech hubs isn’t enough to make up for those drawbacks. And as widespread labor shortages subside and layoffs sweep through Silicon Valley, companies are no longer in a perk war to recruit and retain the brightest minds.

Zoom out: The Big Tech office push mirrors broader white-collar labor market dynamics. In December, 13% of LinkedIn postings were for remote jobs, compared to 20% nine months prior.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Milwaukee’s haunted hotel Pfister Hotel on September 20, 2014 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Raymond Boyd/Getty Images It’s a big universe out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Los Angeles Dodgers star outfielder Mookie Betts isn’t spooked by a 100 mph fastball…but he sure as heck is scared of ghosts.

When his team traveled to Milwaukee last week to play the Brewers, Betts declined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uO?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> to stay at the downtown Pfister Hotel with the rest of the Dodgers and opted to shack up with some friends at an Airbnb instead.

Why? Because the 130-year-old Pfister Hotel is allegedly haunted by the apparition of its founder, Charles Pfister. And, while it’s unclear whether Pfister’s ghost is on the Brewers payroll (designated specter?), he’s relished the opportunity to disturb visiting baseball players who’ve stayed there.

* In 2001, visiting player Adrián Beltré said his TV inexplicably kept turning off and on, and he heard unexplained knocking on his door, according to Sports Illustrated. He ended up getting just two hours of sleep in three nights.

* Eight MLB players, including Bryce Harper and Giancarlo Stanton, reported spooky experiences <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uP?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> when staying at the Pfister. “From the minute I walk in there, I’m freaked out,” Justin Upton told ESPN.

When its founder isn’t conducting psychological warfare against baseball players, the Pfister Hotel is considered one of the nicest hotels in Milwaukee and a historic landmark <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uQ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781>. Every US president since William McKinley has stayed at the Pfister, and Elvis Presley checked in just four months before he died, according to WUWM.—NF

Good morning. The Social Security Administration released its list of the most popular baby names for 2022, and Liam and Olivia continued their reigns as the top names for boys and girls, respectively.

But look at the fastest-rising names, and you’ll see the impact of pop culture. Dutton, popularized in the TV Western Yellowstone, moved up the most spots of any name, jumping 986 spots from 2021 to No. 835 this year.

Hopefully the Duttons will fare better than all the poor Khaleesis out there.

Musk taps ad exec as new Twitter CEO <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Linda Yaccarino photo in Twitter logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images
It’s gotta be a culture shock to leave a multinational media conglomerate for a place that automatically replies to press requests with a poop emoji. Elon Musk announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> yesterday that NBCUniversal’s former chair of global advertising and partnerships Linda Yaccarino will succeed him as Twitter CEO, despite coming from the media world Musk despises.

Who is Yaccarino? She’s a heavyweight in the advertising industry, nicknamed “the velvet hammer” for her negotiating tactics. She formally announced leaving NBCUniversal yesterday after spending the last 11 years at the company. Yaccarino backed Musk’s professed views on free speech when she interviewed him onstage at a conference in Miami last month.

Yaccarino brings something Twitter has desperately lacked since Musk took over: credibility with advertisers. When Musk took over the platform, ad sales brought in more than 90% of Twitter’s revenue, but after a shaky takeover, advertisers bounced.

Monthly ad revenue from Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers dropped from roughly $127 million in October 2022 (the month Musk bought the company) to $48 million in January 2023, according to digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower.

Musk tried to replace some of those lost dollars by making people pay for their blue check marks with Twitter Blue, but that flopped. If Musk really wants to turn Twitter into an “everything app <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vU?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>,” a good place to start is getting the best in the biz to bring back advertisers.

Looking ahead…Musk will move over to the CTO and executive chairman positions, and Yaccarino isn’t necessarily set up for success. Becoming the CEO of Twitter kinda feels like inheriting a beautiful Victorian house that is rapidly flooding because every single pipe has been intentionally smashed by the previous owner. Also, a bunch of angry people (some wearing badges!) currently live there.

She’s got her work cut out for her wooing companies: Just yesterday, Twitter removed its autocomplete suggestion function after NBC reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vV?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> the app was suggesting animal abuse videos to anyone typing “dog” or “cat” into the search bar.—MM

Jerome Powell may get a new No. 2. President Biden said yesterday that he would nominate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6v-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> economist Philip Jefferson, who is already on the Fed’s board, to become second-in-command at the central bank, replacing Lael Brainard. He also plans to nominate the current US rep to the World Bank, Adriana Kugler, to an empty board seat. She would be the Fed’s first Latina governor. If confirmed by the Senate, the pair will jump into their new roles as the Fed continues to try to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, so no pressure there.

Border update: The expiration of Title 42, the policy that allowed the US to expel migrants seeking asylum on public health grounds, was followed by relative calm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wt?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> at the southern border yesterday after border crossing surged earlier in the week. But the Biden Administration is facing legal challenges to its current border policies from both the right and left that could determine what happens next, including one where Florida and other Republican-led states won an order Thursday forbidding the US from releasing migrants without court dates for two weeks.

Mom with “doomsday” beliefs convicted of murder. An Idaho jury found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6v_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> of murdering two of her children and conspiring in the murder of her husband’s first wife. Prosecutors chalked her motives up to “money, power, and sex,” while her attorneys claimed she was led astray by cultlike beliefs—including that the two children were turned into zombies by bad spirits and that she was a goddess who would trigger the apocalypse. She now faces the possibility of life in prison when she is sentenced.

Turkey heads to the polls tomorrow to decide whether to send its strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into retirement. Erdoğan faces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w1?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> the biggest threat yet in the 20 years he’s led the country: His opponent, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, is slightly ahead in the polls.

The two politicians are selling wildly different visions for the nation with the second largest army in NATO, and it looks like democracy itself is on the ballot. Given that Turkey is a major trade and geopolitical partner for the US, the EU, and Russia, it’s no wonder that political pundits, investors, and newsletter writers are all watching closely as its citizens choose its future.

Kılıçdaroğlu leads the chorus of critics accusing Erdoğan of governing like an authoritarian and blaming his unorthodox policy choices for the country’s runaway inflation. He’s branded himself as a secular, democracy-first alternative to the religious, traditionalist incumbent.

Erdoğan is wooing voters with promises to replicate the economic boom Turkey experienced earlier in his tenure, even as the nation rebuilds from the devastating earthquake that threatened his popularity. He’s also leaning on conservative, family, and religious values.

Looking ahead…there likely won’t be a clear winner tomorrow, setting up a second voting round for later this month. And some political scientists are worried Erdoğan won’t concede the election even if he loses.—SK

BOOKS

Swifties haven’t been this disappointed since the release of ‘ME!’ <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Best seller sticker with Taylor Swift's face over picture of BTS members <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Morning Brew/Image: Getty Images
Yesterday, the publishing world crushed Swifties’ dreams when it was revealed that an unpublished, untitled book believed to be a Taylor Swift memoir was, in fact, not <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>.

The hype surrounding the potential Swift tell-all shot the book up to No. 2 on Amazon’s bestseller list this week, forcing Flatiron Books to announce the real author of the book, K-pop band BTS, a month earlier than planned.

What made people think Swift wrote it? Swifties love a conspiracy. Amazon listed the book as 4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023 Hardcover by “Flatiron Author to be Revealed July 2023.” Fans found a number of Easter eggs pointing to Swift in the book’s few known details. For example, the digits in the number of pages (544) adds up to Swift’s lucky number (5+4+4=13.) And the book’s release date, July 9, is 1) mentioned in her song “Last Kiss” and 2) close to July 7, the date that Taylor’s version of Speak Now is set to be released.

But…July 9, 2023, also marks the 10-year anniversary of the founding of an equally adoring fanbase: ARMY <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>. The book, actually titled, Beyond the Story: 10-Year Record of BTS, is now No. 1 on the Amazon and Barnes & Nobles bestseller lists.—CC

The company expects to deliver 23 million flowers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wb?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> for tomorrow’s holiday, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s the nationwide florist’s biggest floral delivery day of the year, accounting for 10% of its annual revenue and trumping Valentine’s Day which brings in ~9%.

In addition to knowing what guilty pleasure song you secretly play on repeat, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek knows what people are talking about…or at least what people with podcasts are. Ek tweeted Thursday that he checked his company’s data <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> and the number of daily podcast episodes about AI has spiked 500% over the last 30 days. Someday all those hot takes will probably become fodder to train future AI models.

Good morning. Looks like Twitter is finally getting a new CEO. Current boss Elon Musk tweeted yesterday that he found his replacement to lead Twitter and that she’ll be starting as CEO in six weeks, while he’ll move aside to oversee product.

So, who could it be? Well, it’d have to be someone with a strong business background who has experience staring down trolls and working in a tumultuous environment: Shoshanna Shapiro from Girls.

Zelda is back and bigger than ever Scene from Zelda Nintendo
If your gamer friends go MIA this weekend, they’re probably answering the call to take up arms as the Hero of Hyrule in the most anticipated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> video game release of the year: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, out today.

It’s a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), the flagship Nintendo Switch game that gave a jolt to the slumping video game console market. Nintendo said Breath of the Wild sold almost 30 million copies—more than all <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> of the previous 3D installments in the franchise’s four-decade history combined, Wired reports.

It looks like Tears of the Kingdom could surpass its predecessor. The game is about two gigabytes bigger than Breath of the Wild and $10 more expensive in its digital edition, making it the Switch’s largest and priciest Nintendo game, per GameSpot.

What’s all the hype?

The Zelda hive is BIG. The Reddit group devoted to the world of Zelda has 2.1 million members compared to just 147,000 in r/Mario, and it far outstrips r/CallOfDuty and r/gtaonline, two powerhouse video game franchises.

With such a rabid fanbase, Zelda has pushed beyond the borders of its land, Hyrule, and into broader pop culture.

Its characters have been referenced in mainstream media like The Simpsons, How I Met Your Mother, My Little Pony, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

ASAP Mob, Rejjie Snow, and Chance the Rapper have all sampled sound effects specific to the Zelda games in songs.

Fun fact: Zelda was Robin Williams’s favorite video game franchise, so much so that he named his only daughter Zelda.

Big picture: While The Legend of Zelda has been adored by gamers since the original 8-bit Link slashed moblins on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986, Breath of the Wild revolutionized open-world gaming and invited a wave of new and younger players to join the die-hards.

Tears of the Kingdom is expected to capitalize on the last installment’s momentum by picking up where its predecessor left off, but with a bigger map, more creative gameplay, and a brand-new campaign to beat.—ML

All eyes in the southern border as Title 42 ends. The Covid-era policy that allowed US authorities to quickly deport migrants expired <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ri?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> at 11:59pm last night, and it’s expected to result in a spike in border crossings that the US is likely not prepared to handle. 60,000 people were waiting near the border to enter the US yesterday, though Border Patrol is already far beyond capacity with 25,000 migrants in custody, the BBC reported. The Biden administration has replaced Title 42 with other policies intended to stem illegal crossings.

WORK

Surprise: People like their jobs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Graph showing share of people who are satisfied in their jobs from 1987-2023 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254>
The Conference Board released new data <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> showing that 62.3% of US workers are satisfied with their job, the highest share since the business research organization started the survey in 1987.

What’s behind the newfound satisfaction? It’s not kombucha on tap, a yoga wellness retreat, or because next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day. Rather, resurgent employee happiness is mostly attributed to hybrid work arrangements, job flexibility, and the pandemic-induced tight labor market that has allowed people to leave jobs they hate for jobs they like (or at least hate less).

Note: The survey was conducted last November, before tech companies started mass layoffs.

But even worker satisfaction has a gender gap. Women were less satisfied <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rn?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> overall than men in each of the 26 categories surveyed, including leave policies, promotions, and culture. The biggest gap was in job security: 68.7% of men felt satisfied with their level of job security, compared to 61.8% of women.

It’s unclear how the potential economic downturn would affect worker satisfaction. If the labor market cools off significantly, employees will be less able to ditch jobs they’re unhappy with as companies lamp down on hiring.—CC

Could Beyoncé make more than T. Swift on her tour? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Beyonce performing in Sweden <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
This week in Sweden, Beyoncé returned to the stage solo for the first time in seven years for the start of her 56-stop Renaissance World Tour. Don’t worry, we’re not about to spoil the set list.

Stressed-out pop fans have shelled out a lot of money in the last six months for tickets to two mega stadium tours: Bey’s and Taylor Swift’s. Tickets for each tour are averaging $700 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254>, professor and VC Peter Cohan estimates. But with Beyoncé now joining Swift on the road, the race to earn $1 billion on a single tour has begun in earnest.

No tour has ever brought in $1 billion

Elton John’s nine-legged (and still counting) Yellow Brick Road farewell tour is the best-selling tour ever, grossing $800 million as of February.

But if anyone can hit nine zeroes, it’s the two queens of pop.

Cohan estimates that the Renaissance Tour could bring in anywhere from $275 million to $2.4 billion in gross ticket sales based on venues, contract terms, and Bey’s previous concert income.

On the top end of that range, that’d be far more than Taylor Swift’s expected $500–$600 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rt?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> haul, per Bloomberg's estimates—but that’s before any overseas T. Swift shows have been announced.

Bottom line: With Bruce Springsteen, the Grateful Dead, and Blink 182 packing stadiums along with T. Swift and Beyoncé, this year could be the biggest ever for live music, according to Bloomberg.—MM

Researchers Edward Glaeser and Carlo Ratti made the comparison to emphasize how NYC and other large American cities need to make drastic changes to their zoning laws to adapt to the WFH era.

Following the interview, in which Trump repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, CNN was roasted by people both outside and inside the network for giving Trump a platform to air obvious lies. Licht countered that the town hall highlighted the importance of the 2024 election: “People woke up, and they know what the stakes are in this election in a way that they didn’t the day before,” he said.

IMMIGRATION

US braces for border chaos as Title 42 expires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6n_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> People standing at the US-Mexico border <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6n_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images
Today marks the end of the US Public Health Emergency for Covid-19. And when it expires tonight, so does the controversial immigration policy Title 42.

What is Title 42? A public health policy that went into effect in March 2020 that allowed US Border Patrol to turn away migrants seeking asylum to prevent the further spread of Covid. Title 42 received criticism from the ACLU and other advocacy organizations for using public health as a pretext for keeping immigrants out of the country. Border regulations will now revert to pre-pandemic rules permitting asylum-seekers to stay in the US while their cases are processed.

Why is it expiring? Title 42 was only legal because of the national public health emergency. Now that the Biden administration is ending the emergency, Title 42 has no legal basis.

Authorities anticipate an immigration surge

Officials expect those who attempted to make it into the US during Title 42 could try again, knowing that they can’t be turned away so easily. The following places have already declared a state of emergency:

Brownsville, El Paso, and Laredo, Texas. In El Paso, an estimated 2,300 people are living on the streets because shelters are at maximum capacity.

Chicago. The self-proclaimed “sanctuary city” saw more than 8,000 migrants arrive in the past year.

Two New York counties. The counties each declared a separate state of emergency after NYC Mayor Eric Adams said he wanted to send migrants to hotels in the suburbs.

Looking ahead…1,500 additional troops sent by the Biden administration have started to arrive at the border. The president is also expanding legal avenues into the US for migrants. But whether or not the federal government has an adequate plan to handle the increase in migrants at the border remains to be seen.—CC

If drugmaker Perrigo scores this approval for Opill, it would be the first nonprescription oral contraceptive sold in the US. The FDA is expected to make a final decision this summer.

After being dragged in the court of public opinion for deceiving voters about his qualifications and personal connection to 9/11, Rep. George Santos’s alleged aversion to the truth got him indicted on 13 financial crimes yesterday. The congressman pleaded not guilty.

If convicted, the New York lawmaker could get more than 20 years in prison <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ns?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> for wire fraud alone, in addition to the sentences potentially carried by money laundering, theft of public funds, and—perhaps least surprisingly—lying to the House of Representatives.

According to federal prosecutors, Santos allegedly:

Solicited campaign donations that ended up in his pocket, including tens of thousands of dollars used to pay off debts, give money to associates, and foot the bill for designer clothes (très chic).

Falsely claimed unemployment in the summer of 2020 to get $24,000 in pandemic-era benefits. He was reportedly employed at the time at Florida-based investment firm Harbor City Capital…which the SEC shut down in 2021 for being a “classic Ponzi scheme.”

Failed to mention those unemployment benefits or earnings from Harbor City on congressional financial disclosure forms.

Where does this leave Congress? Santos says he won’t resign and has even pledged to run for reelection. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he would not support the reelection bid, but he’s not calling for Santos to resign—yet. He said he would do so if the House Ethics Committee finds Santos broke the law.—ML

The world got a peek at what exactly the Googleplex team (or what’s left of it after the 12,000-person layoff in January) has been working on at Google’s yearly developer conference, Google I/O, yesterday.

The biggest news came from the AI department: Google announced its new AI model, PaLM 2, which will power its leveled-up Bard chatbot. PaLM 2 was trained on academic papers and 100+ languages.

And it may be the future <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6o6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> of search: Instead of gathering up a bunch of links (sponsored and just plain popular), answers to queries will be written by Google’s AI and will appear at the top of the page for some searches, the company said.

The update will roll out to just a few users at first but could signal a radical change <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6o7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> for publishers.

Here are some other highlights:

Google’s first foldable phone. The highly anticipated Google Pixel Fold will hit shelves in late June with a whopping $1,799 price tag. Google also launched its first Pixel Tablet and new Pixel 7a smartphone (neither folds, though).

Get lost in 3D. Google Maps will add an “Immersive View” for routes in select cities where users can see a 3D view of their route with features like a traffic simulation, bike lane demarcations, and parking info.

MEDIA

Americans don't agree on what news to trust <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Turning on TV gif <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
“In the media we only sometimes trust” could be America’s motto, according to the results of a YouGov poll <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> released yesterday. The April survey shows extreme polarization in how much folks trust 45 different news outlets.

CNN and MSNBC are the most divisive media orgs: A much larger share of Democrats than Republicans think they’re in the business of telling the truth. Winning over Democrats may be the easier task: The survey shows they're more likely to trust the media in general—they’re even more likely than Republicans to have faith in the conservative-leaning New York Post.

And, in some good news for the brave souls who report from the eye of the storm, the most trusted news source overall is The Weather Channel, followed by PBS and the BBC. Meanwhile, only a handful of ultra-distrusted publications, including Breitbart News, The Daily Caller and InfoWars, have more skeptics than believers, per the survey.

What this means for TV

The lack of trust likely isn’t helping cable news ratings. CNN and Fox News, enjoying the trust of just 40% and 38% of the public, respectively, are struggling to convince viewers to tune in.

CNN had a 61% drop in prime-time viewership in March compared with a year earlier, as it attempts to reinvent itself under new management.

Fox lost 29.6% of its prime-time audience in the week after it dismissed its most popular on-air personality, Tucker Carlson, in the wake of a defamation scandal with a $787.5 million legal settlement.

But at least the two TV behemoths have less of a credibility problem to worry about than TikTok, which ranked as the most distrusted social media platform in the survey—even among younger adults. Meanwhile, LinkedIn is the only social media site with a greater share of folks trusting it than not.

Looking ahead…the situation might be improving: Media skepticism overall has declined in recent months compared to a similar YouGov survey from last year.—SK

Monogram aims to launch the first active-cutting robotic surgical assistant on the market to install their personalized, 3D-printed joint implants. Perfect timing, since 50% of joint replacement surgeries will involve robotics by 2030.

Tour de headlines House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images
The debt ceiling dance is on. President Biden is scheduled to meet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> today with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders to negotiate over raising the debt limit (and thereby avert economic catastrophe). The two sides are coming into the negotiations far apart: Biden says it should be raised with no conditions, while Republicans have vowed only to raise it in exchange for steep spending cuts. The clock is ticking as the US is expected to run out of money to pay all its bills as of June, but today’s meeting is not expected to produce a final result.

Meat prices are coming down. It’s good news for anyone whose regular pizza order is the meat lovers, but bad news for Tyson Foods, which reported a surprise $97 million quarterly loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gi?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> yesterday (sending its stock down 16%). The company said that it’s still facing higher prices for feed and livestock, but can’t pass the extra costs to consumers because of waning demand. Its average sale price dropped 10.3% for pork and 5.4% for beef last quarter.

The Army terminated Texas mall shooter after three months. As authorities continued to investigate the motives and white supremacist views of the shooter who killed eight people at a Texas outlet mall over the weekend, military officials told news outlets yesterday that he had been discharged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gj?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> from the US Army in 2008 due to a mental health issue after just three months and did not complete training. The shooter, who was killed by police during the attack, purchased the guns he used through legal private sales that did not require background checks, but this type of discharge would not come up in checks.

Good news for weary travelers: The Biden administration is writing new rules that would require cash compensation for flyers when airlines are responsible for a cancellation or lengthy delay.

This will be a first for US-based airlines: Refunds for canceled flights are federally required, but no major carrier offers extra cash for the inconvenience. Only JetBlue and Alaska Airlines guarantee compensation beyond a refund of any kind—and it’s in the form of frequent flyer miles or vouchers.

Air travel complaints have quadrupled in recent years, with the majority coming from travelers trying to get refunds. And for good reason: Transportation Department figures attribute almost 80% of cancellations from the first half of 2022 to airline mismanagement like crew shortages, craft maintenance, or late-arriving planes. Those kinds of situations would warrant compensation in addition to a refund under the Biden administration’s planned rules <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933>.

Airlines would also be required to cover meals, transportation, and hotels during flight disruptions, which most (except Frontier) started doing voluntarily after last summer’s nightmare travel season. Experts predict this summer could be even worse, but the new rules could take months or even years to implement.

Until then…travelers can use the Transportation Department’s newly expanded customer service dashboard <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> to see what each airline offers for delays or cancellations.—ML

FASHION

‘Quiet luxury’ is fashion’s biggest trend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Kendall, Shiv, and Roman Roy in a scene from "Succession" <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Claudette Barius/HBO
Succession has taken over the internet with its memes, crafty Machiavellian insults, and Kendall Roy obsessives. And now it’s taking over your closet with “quiet luxury.”

Thanks in part to the show’s cashmere baseball caps <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933>, quiet luxury is surging: The term surpassed 35 billion views on TikTok.

What is it? Many in the fashion industry are defining quiet luxury much like the Supreme Court defined obscenity in 1964: You know it when you see it. It’s well-tailored clothing made from expensive fabrics in neutral colors and logo-free—think bespoke.

Why now? Seeing Succession characters as fashion inspo is part of it, but so is the looming possibility of a recession: Quiet luxury last had a resurgence in 2008. While the economy grapples with banking turmoil, Big Tech layoffs, and interest rate hikes, flashy styles—like a neon Balenciaga bodysuit—are just not it. Instead, quiet luxury <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> insists on quality. According to brand research firm Edited, “Quiet luxury provides investment pieces with a year-round appeal that offers consumers a good cost-per-wear return.”

Style trickles down: This Spring/Summer season’s lines saw the use of premium materials, like pima cotton and merino wool, up 32% year over year, according to Edited, proving the impact of quiet luxury on the mass market. Expect to see more accessible retailers turn to elevated basics.—CC

Stat: While some people have so much pasta they just dump it in the woods of New Jersey, over in Italy, surging pasta prices are interfering with la dolce vita. The Italian government has scheduled crisis talks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> for this Thursday to address the soaring cost of noodles, which jumped 17.5% year over year in March even as wheat prices fell. Inflation is high in Italy, but not that high: Overall consumer prices rose by 8.1% in the same month.

Quote: “Great win for the Suns last night in an amazing series so far! That should be and is the only story.”

To the great debates of our time—like Coke or Pepsi and whether Han shot first—we can now add the question of whether Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia was fouled or flopped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gx?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> during his team’s game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. Nuggets star Nikola Jokić got a technical foul for “deliberately” making contact with Ishbia as he tried to wrest a ball that had sailed into the crowd from him—but it looked to many like Ishbia exaggerated his response to that contact. Either way, Ishbia’s ready to bury the hatchet before Game 5 of the series: He tweeted yesterday that he didn’t want Jokić suspended or fined.

Good morning. If there had to be a day when it was raining so hard that you never left your apartment, at least it was one with an iconic Game 7 performance by Steph Curry, heart-stopping NHL action (sorry, Boston friends), an episode of Succession, and a newsletter to write.

Also: Welcome to May. Best month of the year? You could easily make the argument…

Markets: A new month dawns on Wall Street after the three major indexes posted skimpy gains in April. Last week, Big Tech companies lived up to their name: The tech giants that reported earnings collectively added $320 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> to their market values in a sign that the sector is waking up from its post-pandemic hibernation, the WSJ reports.

Hollywood braces for writers’ strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> Snowy mountains fill the landscape behind the Hollywood sign. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> Patrick T. Fallon / Getty Images
If production companies and unionized writers don’t reach a new contract by midnight tonight, the scribes will put down their No. 2 pencils and strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> for the first time in 15 years.

The stalemate reflects how streaming has upended TV and film, with writers feeling like they aren’t seeing any of the plusses from the emergence of all the plusses.

Depending on how long the strike lasts (if it does happen), it could send Hollywood into a deep freeze: Series might go off the air, productions might get delayed, more reality shows would flood the airwaves, and the California economy could lose billions.

What are the writers’ gripes?

They argue that Hollywood’s pivot to streaming worsened their working conditions and made it hard to earn a middle-class income as a writer. Here’s why…

Shorter series: In the previous TV era, shows like How I Met Your Mother reliably churned out seasons with 20+ episodes. Now, streamers are prioritizing seasons with eight-to-12 episodes.

Residuals: Historically, if you had a writing credit on a TV show and that show was aired as a rerun, you’d earn a royalty payment known as a residual. Streaming has disrupted that income stream.

Mini rooms: In the streaming age, writers often work in “mini rooms” where they crank out scripts at low wages for shows that may or may not be made.

So, there’s a lot of frustration. Last month, 97.85% of eligible members of the Writers Guild of America, which represents most of the working writers in Hollywood, voted to authorize a strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> if an agreement with major studios wasn’t reached. That’s the most support for a work stoppage in the union’s history.

What happens if they strike? Studios have been stockpiling scripts ahead of the May 1 deadline, so scripted TV shows would continue for awhile. But late-night shows and other topical programs like SNL could be impacted almost immediately.

During the last strike, which lasted 100 days from 2007–2008, Conan O’Brien filled the airtime by seeing how long he could spin his wedding ring. More importantly, it cost the LA economy over $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.

Tour de headlines Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein on a private plane Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein on a private plane. US Attorney's Office SDNY.
Jeffrey Epstein’s private calendar shows meetings with bigwigs. The late, disgraced financier had meetings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Vb?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> with the future top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, the future director of the CIA, professor Noam Chomsky, and other prominent individuals years after he became a convicted sex offender. That’s according to the WSJ, which reviewed Epstein’s schedules and emails that show the arranged meetings. When asked by the WSJ why they planned to meet with Epstein, most of these people “told the Journal they visited Epstein for reasons related to his wealth and connections,” the paper said.

Biden also pressed for the release of other Americans detained abroad, including freelancer Austin Tice and former Marine Paul Whelan.

According to police, neighbors approached this man and asked him to stop shooting his gun in his backyard because they had an infant who was trying to sleep. The man got upset after hearing this, and walked into their house and killed five of them, including an eight-year-old, with an AR-15-style rifle, police said. The FBI special agent in charge acknowledged authorities have “zero leads” about where the suspect is hiding.

US financial regulators just executed the banking version of a house flip. Authorities seized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5VB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> First Republic Bank this morning and sold most of its assets to JPMorgan, the country’s largest bank.

First Republic Bank’s collapse marks the second-biggest banking failure in US history, topping Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in March. Like SVB, First Republic is a midsized California-based lender with a specific client base—in this case, wealthy individuals—that made it particularly exposed to the shockwaves of the recent banking turmoil.

First Republic tried to weather the storm itself, but after customers withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits in Q1 and its share price plunged nearly 75% last week alone, the government had to hang the “closed” sign on the door.

But by quickly finding a buyer over the weekend, the government avoided what it had to do for SVB: Protect deposits over the federally insured cap of $250,000. JPMorgan said it will assume First Republic’s $92 billion in deposits, which is a welcome outcome since making SVB depositors whole cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund about $20 billion.

Big picture: This government-brokered acquisition is just the latest in a series of bigger banks swallowing failing, smaller banks at a discount this spring. First Citizens collected the scraps of SVB, New York Community Bank snatched up assets of Signature Bank, and UBS absorbed crosstown rival Credit Suisse.

It’s a total 180 from last year, when Dorsey said Musk was “the singular solution I trust” to lead the company. Bluesky, meanwhile, got a lot of buzz last week after prominent folks like AOC, Dril, and Chrissy Teigen joined the platform.

Polly wanna FaceTime? Parrots, for one species, don’t think Zoom happy hours are cringe. A new study had parrot owners in the US teach their feathered pets to use tablets to make video calls. And just like humans in the early days of lockdown, the birds felt less lonely <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> when they could virtually hang out with one another. The parrots could choose who they wanted to ring, and the popular birds turned out to be the ones who initiated the most calls.

Hot off the press: stick-on vaccines. Researchers at MIT have created a new type of tabletop printer that spits out vaccine doses on demand in the form of thumbnail-size microneedle patches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>. Once scaled, this mobile technology could produce hundreds of doses per day, revolutionizing pandemic response. And in a boon for warmer or more remote parts of the world, the vaccine patches can be stored at room temperature for months before they’re slapped on—no refrigeration or professional administering required.

It’s official: AI will make you more productive at work.

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  The hottest esport is...chess <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5So?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> Man playing chess online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5So?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>goc/Getty Images What are the youths into these days? A centuries-old board game. Chess is the talk of recess but now, just like everything else, it’s happening online.

At the center of the frenzy is Chess.com, a site where folks can face off against each other or play against a bot (like the insolent cat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sp?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> Mittens). It’s seen an influx of players since 2020 when many turned to the game of kings as a way to avoid pandemic lockdown boredom.

The game’s popularity during Covid was helped along by the Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, whose barrier-smashing, chess prodigy heroine inspired millions to play. But the latest chess boom is fueled not by Beth Harmon, but by influencers helping young people realize online chess can be just as fun as Minecraft and Fortnite.

Keeping chess in check at school

Schools nationwide are dealing with an epidemic of distracted kids sneakily playing matches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> on their phones during classes, according to the Washington Post. While some teachers have been confiscating phones, at least one teacher on Reddit said they are happy it’s chess the kids are into and not Andrew Tate.

Maxim Dlugy, who runs a Manhattan chess school, told us his student body has increased more than threefold, from about 200 to 700 since the start of the pandemic.

And Chess.com’s traffic has soared: The site’s servers crashed multiple times as its daily user count doubled from November 2022 to December 2022, and reached 12 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> this month, according to Polygon.

The sport was likely helped along last year by a perfect hype storm created by Magnus Carlsen, the world’s No. 1 chess player, accusing an opponent of cheating in an in-person game, as well as a Louis Vuitton campaign in which Messi and Ronaldo faced off across a chess board. But the biggest boost came from a cadre of influencers working to win over teens.

* The top chess streamers on Twitch have over a million followers each who are eager to see them play and break down their moves.

* TikTok videos with #chess have been viewed 11.6 billion times.

Unlike in the chess heydays of the last century, one need not be a Bobby Fischer-level genius to achieve chess stardom now. Though some chess influencers are among the best players on the planet, many are merely decent and make up for their lack of big-league skill with charisma.

One of the most popular chess YouTubers, Levy Rozman, is a pro, but he lacks the grandmaster designation of top-tier players. That doesn’t bother the 3.6 million followers who tune into his strategy tutorials and his breakdowns of the epic moments in famous chess matches played by others.

Embracing the esport

With the online game becoming dominant, the esport versions of rapid and blitz chess are increasingly getting professional buy-in. Carlsen said he’s taking a break from in-person matches until at least 2024 and will be focusing on online chess tournaments. He recently sold a chess app to Chess.com and announced this week that he’s starting a Fantasy Chess game (Carlsen is an elite fantasy soccer manager).

And the Champions Chess Tour, a series of online tournaments now hosted by Chess.com, features some of the biggest names in the sport, including Carlsen. The matches are time-limited to just a few minutes, similar to the ones amateurs play on Chess.com and influencers stream on Twitch.

The company hopes that the Champions Chess Tour will become the flagship event “for all of chess” in the future, a spokesperson for Chess.com told Morning Brew.

Looking ahead…some players like Carlsen and US champion Fabiano Caruana predict that hourslong IRL matches will get phased out as pro chess moves online and shorter games dominate.—SK

  Place to be: Westminster Abbey Westminster Abbey, London Tim Graham/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

On Saturday, King Charles III, like every British monarch since 1066, will be coronated at Westminster Abbey in London.

What is this place? It’s undoubtedly the most important church <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> for the British monarchy, having hosted dozens of royal coronations, weddings, funerals, and other important ceremonies over its nearly 1,000-year history. Westminster Abbey hasn’t been the site of a coronation since Queen Elizabeth II’s in 1953, but it was the location of her funeral last year, Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997, and the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. 

In addition to hosting royal pomp and circumstance, Westminster Abbey has a number of, er, permanent installations, such as the interred bodies of some of the most notable figures in British history. Legendary artists such as writer Geoffrey Chaucer and composer George Frideric Handel are buried in a section known as Poets’ Corner. Charles Dickens was buried there, too, though he didn’t want to be <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>.

If you do want to be there, you’re probably into history, because Westminster Abbey is a great place to visit if you enjoy looking at really old things. There’s an old chair <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>, an old door <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SF?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>, and, currently en route from Scotland, an old stone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>. Westminster Abbey is typically open to the public, but it’s closed April 25–May 8 for reasons.—NF

Markets: Stocks rose yesterday, finishing strong to give the Dow its best month <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Up?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> since January. One that didn’t was First Republic, which tanked as rumors flew about its fate (more on that in just a moment).

Economy: For all the Fed watchers out there, new data released today sure makes it look like another rate hike could be in store next week. The data shows wages are still rising and one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures rose slightly last month.

First Republic might be breathing its last breaths. Regulators are gearing up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> to take over the beleaguered regional lender, just like they did the two banks that failed last month, Reuters reported yesterday.

Officials spent the past few days huddling with financial institutions to come up with an action plan to prevent First Republic from becoming the latest bank meltdown headline. But there appear to be no private banks willing to help it raise more cash.

How’d we get here?

The bank panic that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left First Republic’s depositors worried about whether it could stay afloat. Like many regional banks, it invested depositor cash in assets that were devalued over the past year by rising interest rates.

First Republic got hit extra hard by the crisis because it successfully pursued wealthy clients in order to grow. But those same clients understood that, if the banking sector’s troubles seeped into First Republic, they wouldn’t be made whole by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as two-thirds of accounts at the bank had balances above the $250k insurance threshold.

Clients pulled more than $100 billion from their accounts in the first quarter of 2023, leaving First Republic with a 40% reduction in deposits.

Things calmed down after big banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America deposited $30 billion in the bank last month. Although this reassured customers, First Republic began to rack up interest fees on government rescue loans. And it reported dismal quarterly results this week.

Its stock has plummeted more than 70% since Monday, putting it at a 97% loss compared to the start of the year.

Looking ahead…if the bank fails, regulators will have some busy days ahead of them deciding whether to make First Republic depositors whole and assuring the public that the banking sector isn’t in trouble.—SK

The Fed says it’s time for new bank rules. Just in time for a new looming bank failure, the Federal Reserve issued a 102-page report dissecting the corpse of Silicon Valley Bank. The Fed pointed the finger at both its own inadequate supervision and the bank’s management. And in an accompanying letter, Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, called for <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UQ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> stricter rules to be applied to more financial institutions, as well as for more tools to be given to regulators to bring firms with poor capital planning and risk management into line.

North Carolina plays the reverse card on gerrymandering. The newly installed Republican majority on North Carolina’s Supreme Court took a look at the court’s recent precedents on voting rights and decided they’d rather go in a different direction <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UR?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763>. In two separate decisions yesterday, the court tossed out an earlier ruling that rejected Republican-drawn election maps and reinstated a voter ID law that the prior court had nixed as racially biased. A third ruling denied voting rights to people with some felony convictions.

Can Jack Dorsey make Twitter 2.0? So far, none of the social media platforms hyped as the big thing for those looking to replace Elon Musk’s Twitter have gained real traction, but the latest one, Bluesky, might have a bit of an edge—and not just because Chrissy Teigen has already joined. The app—which has much of the same functionality as the bird app and is so far only open to those with an invitation—has funding <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> from Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s founder. The twist is that the new app intends to be decentralized, meaning people will be able to create their own personalized communities within.

RETAIL

New stores will soon replace the Beyond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Shopper peering into closed Bed Bath and Beyond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
In the wake of the company’s bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond is closing all 360 of its locations (and all of its Buybuy Baby stores). But those giant, fluorescently lit buildings will be filled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ur?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> soon enough, as retail landlords are swimming in potential tenants.

There’s a big-box space shortage: Vacancy rates for existing retail space hit 4.9% at the end of last year, which is at the lowest since 2005, when commercial real estate firm CBRE started tracking it. This and the meager new construction since 2008 means there’s simply not enough space for companies like HomeGoods to chaotically display ceramic dog statues and gaudy throw pillows.

With large retail spaces in short supply, discount outlets like TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, Five Below, and even budget gym Planet Fitness are plotting to snatch up old BB&B locations, some even before the last toaster is sold.

Bottom line: The BB&B closures are a welcome influx of space. According to Coresight,  retailers opened more stores than they closed in 2022 for the first time since 2016.—MM

No Shave November in May…but for lawns <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Homeowners participating in No Mow May let their grass grow all month. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Francis Scialabba
To mow or not to mow? That is the question homeowners are debating as more cities and towns embrace No Mow May, a movement started in 2019 to revitalize backyard wildlife by refraining from lawn care for an entire month.

And it works, sort of.

In past years, participants have watched their lawns transform from an “ecological dead zone”—as one professor calls the average American yard—into a tall-grassed ecosystem rife with bumblebees, songbirds, chipmunks, and other forest friends...or foes. Last year, some Minnesotans called the police on snakes they spotted.

But some environmentalists say No Mow May <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> isn’t the right way to bring biodiversity back to residential areas because it “teases” insects and other pollinators. Their newfound habitat goes away when homeowners bust out the lawnmowers on June 1.

Instead, experts encourage supporting local wildlife by seeding native plants and other pollinator-attracting greenery. The Guelph Turfgrass Institute suggests channeling the benefits of No Mow May during the other 11 months by sectioning off a part of the yard as a permanent “wildflower zone.”—ML

Stat: What does it take to move a 331-pound stone from Scotland to London? A coronation. The Stone of Scone (also known as the Stone of Destiny) has left <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Edinburgh Castle to make its way to the big city for King Charles III’s little party next weekend. The stone is no stranger to such royal affairs: It was present at the anointing of Scottish kings for centuries before it got nabbed by England’s Edward I  in 1296. In 1996, Queen Elizabeth II agreed to send it back up north, but only if it RSVP’d yes to future coronations.

Pop star Katy Perry lost a trademark fight in Australia this week over her own name <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763>. Turns out the famous California girl shares a name with an Aussie fashion designer, Katie Taylor (née Perry), who registered a trademark for her brand Katie Perry there in 2008. And yesterday, a judge who couldn’t help referencing the singer’s best tune in her ruling, refused to void the trademark and found that the less-famous Perry’s rights were violated by merch sold for the other Perry’s 2014 Australian concert tour.

Jerry Springer, ‘ringmaster of civilization’s end,’ dies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Jerry Springer sitting at a desk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Roy Rochlin/Getty Images
Jerry Springer, the talk show host, politician, and king of mess who pushed the boundaries of television with his eponymous daytime talk show, died yesterday at 79. He leaves behind a legacy of norm-defying, provocative storytelling about people on the fringes of society that laid the foundation for the current reality TV landscape.

The Jerry Springer Show, which ran from 1991 to 2018, peaked in popularity in 1998, drawing 12 million viewers and surpassing Oprah’s talk show in the ratings. That year, while Oprah was chatting with celebs like Madonna, Brad Pitt, and Tyra Banks, Springer interviewed three people in interspecies marriages.

Just how weird was The Jerry Springer Show? If you thought Dr. Phil’s “Cash Me Outside” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> episode was strange…you’d better sit down. Examples of guests Springer hosted include members of the KKK <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, adult babies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5O-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, a self-described kung fu hillbilly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5O_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, and a number of folks who came clean about extramarital affairs while on the show.

Springer said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> he only ever interviewed “regular folks, of no fame, little if any wealth, and very little influence,” and he faced many critics who said that in doing so, he profited off the exploitation of low-income people.

But Springer defended his approach. When asked in a 2014 BBC interview if he was ashamed of his show, he said, “You could decide only to put well-scrubbed, wealthy people who speak the Queen’s English on television and just do that, but that wouldn’t reflect the whole society.”

Springer was a busy guy

When he wasn’t breaking up fights on daytime TV, Springer also:

Started as a politician. He was an advisor to Robert F. Kennedy, served as the mayor of Cincinnati from 1977–1978, and ran for Ohio governor in 1982. Luckily, he lost and pivoted to TV.

Inspired a musical. Jerry Springer: The Opera has been running on and off since 2001.

Appeared in a number of other productions, including The Rocky Horror Show on Broadway, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P1?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, and most recently, The Masked Singer as a contestant.

Of course, for ’90s kids, Springer’s greatest role of all was keeping us company on sick days.—CC

Tour de headlines Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell Samuel Corum/Getty Images
Powell got punk’d. In January, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had a phone call with a person he thought was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky…but it was just a prank <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> by Russian tricksters, according to footage from Russian state television. In the video, Powell can be seen answering questions about inflation and the economy in ways that were consistent with his other statements—though the Fed said the video appears to have been edited and cannot confirm its accuracy. Powell isn’t the only victim of these pranksters; they also bamboozled their way to speak with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prince Harry.

Cigarette smoking hits a record low in the US. Just 1 in 9 Americans smoked cigarettes last year, a record low <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, according to the CDC. Compared to the 1960s, when 42% of US adults smoked cigarettes, it’s a dramatic drop that reflects greater awareness of the health risks of smoking, and economic hurdles like cigarette taxes. But Americans haven’t given up their nicotine addiction entirely. Vaping rose to almost 6% last year, and 14% of teens reported using e-cigarettes in another CDC study.

Stroud. Elsewhere in the NFL, the Baltimore Ravens and former MVP QB Lamar Jackson agreed to a five-year deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P8?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> worth $260 million, making Jackson the highest-paid player in the league.

A new challenger emerges in the weight-loss drug race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Eli Lilly manufactures Mounjaro and Trulicity, two antidiabetics with weight loss benefits. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Cristina Arias/Getty Images
Say buongiorno to Mounjaro.

The antidiabetic drug made by Eli Lilly that helps patients shed pounds could dethrone Wegovy (the weight-loss version of Ozempic) as the favorite among celebrities and wealthy people on a diet, according to new clinical trials.

The results reinforced previous findings that Mounjaro (generic name tirzepatide) can help diabetic and nondiabetic patients lose more weight than people did in past studies of Wegovy. But Mounjaro is currently only approved for diabetes, and prescribed patients could lose steady access to the drug.

Eli Lilly has already struggled through shortages of Mounjaro after a social-media-fueled demand for Ozempic seeped into the rest of the sector. And judging by how quickly Wegovy went to backorder after being officially approved for non-diabetes purposes, Mounjaro will likely also face a frenzy of weight-loss prescriptions that causes more shortages.

Once greenlighted for weight loss, Mounjaro is projected to become one of the highest-grossing drugs of all time with $50 billion in annual sales, driving the weight-loss/diabetes medication industry to what some estimate could be $150 billion per year. Wegovy and Ozempic raked in $10 billion last year for manufacturer Novo Nordisk.

The timeline: Eli Lilly expects the FDA to approve Mounjaro for weight loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pa?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> soon—perhaps by the end of the year. And the company is so confident in its potential “blockbuster” drug that it’s beginning an almost two-year trial this week to directly compare it against Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.—ML

Judy Blume’s most famous book finally hits the screen <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pe?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Judy Blume <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pe?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Rob Kim/Stringer via Getty
The first film adaption of Judy Blume’s Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret premieres <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> in theaters today, and reminding many what it was like to be excited about wearing a bra. The novel, published in 1970, remains the beloved author’s best-selling book, but even today, it’s commonly banned around the country.

The story follows Margaret, an 11-year-old girl, as she navigates religion, periods, and toxic friendships in the New Jersey suburbs. Due to its frank discussion of menstruation and puberty, the book (and Blume’s other works) became a substitute of sorts for the sex ed many tweens never had in their classrooms.

That’s also why the novel received pushback

Are You There God and some of Blume’s other 32 titles were challenged during the first significant wave of banning books from schools in the ’80s. She’s spoken out against book bans, but her work is still being pulled from libraries for its discussion of teen sexuality and other taboo topics.

Most recently…Blume’s book Forever was included on a list of 80 books from celebrated authors like Toni Morrison and James Patterson banned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> last month by a Florida school district. A PEN America report released in September found that 1,648 titles were banned from school libraries in the 2021–2022 school year.—MM

If you’re thinking, “Well, I sure hope so,” this wasn’t always the case—as recently as 2015, the New York Times found that the number of Johns who ran large companies outnumbered the number of women who did. Still, women are significantly underrepresented in the corner office: They account for 8% of S&P 500 CEO positions, compared to their 50.5% share of the US population.

Good morning. Yesterday, Netflix announced that the sixth season of its disturbing sci-fi anthology series Black Mirror will hit the platform in June—almost four years since the previous season was released.

What took so long? Could be because the writers had to rework all the episodes after their ideas starting happening.

Disney takes DeSantis feud to the next level <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Lz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Ron DeSantis in front of Disney logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Lz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Hannah Minn
The battle between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest employer is getting hotter than the final plate in the Hot Ones Challenge. Disney and DeSantis have been dueling like Peter Pan and Captain Hook ever since the company criticized the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill last spring, and yesterday Disney sued DeSantis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093>, claiming he orchestrated a campaign of retaliation against the company for exercising its free speech rights.

The feud hinges on control of the special district where Disney World sits. Disney filed its suit almost immediately after the board, hand-picked by DeSantis to govern the district, voted to nullify land use agreements made by the previous Disney-controlled board.

From a spoonful of sugar to a 74-page lawsuit

Disney’s suit accuses DeSantis of a “relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint.”

Disney called the board’s nullification of the earlier agreements “patently retaliatory, patently anti-business and patently unconstitutional.” The suit notes that its existing contracts with the state of Florida would invest $17 billion in Disney World and create 13,000 jobs over the next decade.

The lawsuit also claims that the continued attacks on Disney by DeSantis and other Florida lawmakers are a direct result of the company’s expressed opinion on state legislation.

Historically, Florida has been known for being business-friendly—and Disney, which powers the state’s tourism economy, has benefited from that. Since 1967, the theme park has existed harmoniously with the greater Orlando area as a special tax district, allowing it to essentially act as its own county. But that’s precisely what DeSantis claims is the root of his conflict with the company, saying it has “gotten away with special deals from the State of Florida for way too long.”

Looking ahead…we don’t know if this will impact Florida’s pro-business reputation, but as DeSantis prepares for a potential 2024 presidential bid, even some of his fellow Republicans have criticized his actions against Disney.—CC

McCarthy scores a victory with debt bill that won’t become law. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy corralled just enough votes from his GOP colleagues yesterday to pass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> a bill to raise the debt ceiling while making stark spending cuts. The 320-page bill is meant to be an opening salvo in negotiations with President Biden, who is hoping to avoid an economically catastrophic default. It’s got about as much chance of being the final word on the matter as we do of winning the Nobel Prize—it won’t make it out of the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the president has threatened to veto it.

The move came as a shock because the regulator had previously said Microsoft had assuaged its concerns about the console gaming market. The decision, which Microsoft plans to appeal, puts a strain on the deal while the companies wait for competition decisions from the EU and the US, where the FTC has already sued to try to scuttle it.

Ed Sheeran went to trial yesterday, not for his crimes of pseudo-rapping in “Galway Girl,” but for accusations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LI?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> that he plagiarized Marvin Gaye’s song “Let’s Get It On.” The copyright lawsuit outcome (expected next week) could have major implications on who owns the rights to seemingly common musical elements.

The case dates back to 2017, when the family of Ed Townsend—Gaye’s co-writer on “Let’s Get It On”—sued Sheeran for $100 million, alleging that he copy-and-pasted a four chord progression from the song for his Grammy-winning bop “Thinking Out Loud.”

On one hand…the chord progression does sound almost identical.

And the plaintiff’s lawyer said a video of Sheeran singing a mashup of the two songs at a concert is the star’s “confession.”

Sheeran’s rebuttal was that if he stole Gaye and Townsend’s song, he’d be “quite an idiot to stand on a stage in front of 20,000 people” and perform it.

Sheeran also said during his testimony, “Most pop songs can fit over most pop songs.” His defense team claims that there’s over a dozen songs that use the same chord progression.

Big picture: Copyright infringement claims have been popping up more frequently in the music industry in recent years. This is the third time Sheeran has had to argue that his slow jams weren’t rip-offs.—MM

No one was counting on the Atlanta Hawks getting booted from the playoffs more than the folks who run the team’s stadium—and maybe Janet Jackson.

The singer/actress/dancer was supposed to perform tonight at State Farm Arena, but her concert has been moved to tomorrow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LN?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> after the Hawks secured a last-minute upset over the Celtics this week, bringing the series home for Game 6.

It’s the type of scheduling chaos that conversion crews—the people who assemble courts and stages between events—are actually accustomed to during playoff season, when stadiums get more double-booked than the Airbnb from Barbarian.

Billy Joel had to reschedule a show this week, too. Four consecutive nights of Knicks and Rangers games at Madison Square Garden pushed the Piano Man’s concert from its primo Saturday spot to Tuesday.

LA’s Crypto.com Arena managed a 90-minute turnaround between Clippers and Lakers games last Saturday—sandwiched in the middle of the Kings NHL playoff games on Friday and Sunday. Fun fact: The rink stays covered and insulated between games, meaning basketball players are dribbling around over ice each time they play.

One night, two queens of pop: Janet Jackson’s rescheduled concert will take place at the same time as the first of Taylor Swift’s three Eras Tour shows in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.—ML

While egg prices have fallen dramatically and even Chipotle has paused price hikes on burrito bowls, one sector of the economy remains stubbornly expensive: rents.

In the latest consumer price index report, the shelter category (aka rents) was the largest contributor by far to overall inflation.

And despite moderating in recent months, rent growth remains 17% higher than 2021 levels.

Fallon / Getty Images
After President Biden announced his reelection bid yesterday morning, the Republican National Committee swiftly responded with an attack ad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ip?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>. The video asked the question “What if the weakest president we’ve ever had were re-elected?” and then…imagined the answer.

It had some help from artificial intelligence. The 30-second video used generative AI tools to create images and video of The Last of Us-looking scenes, including one where the army is occupying San Francisco because the city had supposedly been overtaken by crime and fentanyl. The RNC told Axios that it’s the first video the organization has ever created completely using AI.

Get used to it

The video is likely just the start of a 2024 presidential race influenced by AI. While political campaigns have used AI tools to help canvass voters for years, recent breakthroughs in generative AI (like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other programs) have taken the tech to a whole new level of realism.

And, if the past few months are any indication, powerful figures are among the most popular targets of AI-generated shenanigans.

Fake photos (fauxtos, if you will) of the pope swagged out in a giant white puffer coat and former President Trump being carried away by cops went viral due to their shocking realism.

It’s not just images: Fake audio <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> of Biden and Trump slinging insults at each other while they play a video game made the rounds on TikTok and Instagram. Those two men could very well square off in the general election.

Not only has generative AI technology dramatically improved since the last election, but so has access to these programs. ChatGPT, for instance, became the fastest-growing consumer app in history after racking up 100 million users in just two months.

Experts say that since anyone with a computer and a wild imagination can use AI programs, misinformation could be churned out at rapid speed during this election—especially since social media companies have loose policies to keep AI-generated political content in check.

Counterpoint: Misinformation is already doing just fine without AI. Chris Meserole, a Brookings Institution fellow, told Fortune that “recent presidential elections have already witnessed such high levels of human-written misinformation” and expects the next election to look pretty similar to those of 2020 and 2016.

Plus, concerned citizens raised alarms during the 2020 presidential election that deepfakes would sow chaos and confuse voters. But that…didn’t end up happening <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ir?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>.—MM

Alphabet and Microsoft kept calm and carried on. The two tech giants posted earnings that showed they’re both on solid footing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>, despite investors’ concerns that growth would slow to a trickle. For Alphabet, Google Search advertising revenue grew again after a quarter in the red. And Microsoft’s all-important cloud division posted better-than-expected sales. Both companies discussed how AI could impact for their businesses, but they differed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> in their predictions: Microsoft characterized AI as a much more disruptive force than Google did.

You probably know Belafonte best for his catchy-as-all-heck take on the Jamaican folk song, “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)” released in 1956. But after achieving unprecedented commercial success for any musician at the time, especially a Black artist, Belafonte turned his attention to political activism and the fight for civil rights. Belafonte even put up bail for MLK and other civil rights activists to get them out of jail.

PepsiCo products were 16% pricier last quarter, but it sold only 2% less of them, resulting in a 10.2% sales bump.

Consumer giants Kimberly-Clark, Nestlé, and P&G raked in more revenue last quarter after they all jacked up prices by about 10%.

Higher sticker prices helped GM add almost $1,800 to its per-car profit in North America and grow its revenue.

But the good times won’t last. After more than a year of getting hammered by inflation, consumers are starting to resist paying farmers market prices at the grocery store. Pepsi’s CFO said its customers have already been opting for cheaper products <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>, and the CEO of McDonald’s told the Financial Times that customers were starting to push back on the company’s beefier price tags.

Looking ahead…execs at companies like Coca-Cola say it’s only a matter of time before they’ll have to stop increasing prices, or else risk losing customers. Chipotle already beat Coke to it, saying it had paused price hikes.—SK

Apparently, counting melatonin isn’t as easy as counting sheep. A study released yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> showed that the labels on sleepy-time gummies frequently misrepresent the amount of melatonin they contain.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that 22 out of the 25 melatonin products tested by researchers had inaccurate labels that most often lowballed the amount of melatonin they contained. One product even had 347% of the stated amount of melatonin.

For an adult, extra melatonin usually just makes you feel like you had too many Vodka Red Bulls the night before. But for kids, higher levels of melatonin can cause health problems.

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of pediatric melatonin ingestions reported to poison control surged 530%, according to a CDC report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IH?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> last year. Of the 260,000+ incidents reported over that time, over 4,000 kids were hospitalized, five required mechanical ventilation, and two died.

Pediatricians warn that since melatonin is a hormone, even normal consumption on a regular basis can affect a child’s development in puberty.

Big picture: Industry reps and the FDA agree that the dietary supplement marketplace needs a regulatory overhaul. Current US regulations do not require supplement-makers to conduct any clinical trials or obtain FDA approval before putting their products on the shelf. Meanwhile, in the EU, the UK, Canada, and others, melatonin requires a prescription.—CC

Key performance indicators The first Barbie with Down syndrome Mattel
Stat: Barbie introduced its first doll with Down syndrome <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IL?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> as part of its recent push to release dolls that represents more types of women than just the skinny, blonde ones. Barbie-maker Mattel partnered with the National Down Syndrome Society on the design of the doll, which bears a pink pendant necklace with three upward-pointing chevrons to symbolize the 21st chromosome—the chromosome that’s copied in people with Down syndrome.

A tale of 2 prime-time stars flaming out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5EC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5EC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Photo Illustration: Hannah Minn/ Photo: Getty Images
Yesterday was a big day for shake-ups in the cable news world: Fox News broke up with Tucker Carlson, and shortly after, CNN announced that they ousted Don Lemon. Both stars were major personalities for their networks.

What’s behind all the moves? For Carlson, it’s likely more about what’s been happening in the courtroom than on your TV.

Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against Fox, which the network settled less than a week ago for $787.5 million, made Carlson’s private text messages public—including some that criticized Fox’s senior leadership. Those messages played a role in his departure from Fox, per the Washington Post.

Plus, former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg filed a lawsuit last month accusing Carlson and his executive producer, Justin Wells, among others, of sexism and harassment. Wells was let go along with Carlson, and, according to the LA Times, Grossberg’s lawsuit was the main factor in the decision, handed down by Rupert Murdoch, to fire Carlson.

Meanwhile, Lemon made headlines in February for saying that “a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s,” and more recently had combative interviews with some guests. According to the New York Times, Lemon’s future at CNN “had become untenable.”

The bottom line for networks

It appears that Carlson was worth over $500 million—that’s how much the Fox Corp.’s market value dropped after his ousting made news. It’s not entirely surprising: Tucker Carlson Tonight was as synonymous with Fox as Law & Order is to NBC. It has been one of the top shows on cable news and regularly drew more than 3 million nightly viewers.

For CNN, firing Lemon, who had been at the network for 17 years, is one of many recent moves in programming as the network tries to catch up with its competitors. As cable news viewership continues to decrease, all the major networks are launching new shows and overhauling programming to try to recapture the ratings glory days of 2015.—CC

According to Monogram, the problem is straightforward. Today, surgeons perform around 1.7m knee replacement surgeries annually, but as many as 100k of these fail. That’s exactly why Dr. Doug Unis founded Monogram.

With the help of advanced surgical robotics and personalized, 3D-printed implants, Monogram is trying to make knee replacement surgeries safer, less invasive, and more precise.

They’ve already received FDA approval for their implant components.

Tour de headlines Aaron Rodgers
Aaron Rodgers traded to the NY Jets, ESPN reports. After 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, the four-time MVP quarterback is headed to NYC <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Eg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> in a long-anticipated trade. Uncertain of his next move this winter, Rodgers famously entered a darkness retreat in Oregon, and apparently left the experience with the desire to pay a lot more for housing. Rodgers’s move from Green Bay to New York near the end of his career is reminiscient of Brett Favre’s trade to the Jets 15 years ago, which allowed a young Rodgers to take the reins at Lambeau Field.

First Republic Bank lost $102 billion in deposits last month. That’s not good. The regional lender that got swept up in March’s bank turmoil said that deposits plunged nearly 41% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Eh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> last quarter, and they would have fallen by more than 50% if 11 large banks hadn’t plugged it with $30 billion to shore up confidence. But what little confidence was restored seems to have evaporated, not least because execs ended their earnings call after just 12 minutes. The bank’s stock, already down 87% this year, dropped by another ~18% after it released its results.

Apple triumphs in Epic app store dispute, again. An appeals court upheld <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ei?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Apple’s victory in Fortnite-maker Epic Games’s antitrust lawsuit over Apple’s App Store fees. The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed a 2021 trial ruling in the blockbuster legal case that Apple wasn’t running the store like a monopoly. Though the appeals court upheld part of the ruling that favored Epic, Apple called the court’s decision “a resounding victory,” noting that it won on nine out of 10 of the suit’s claims.

As Bloomberg notes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ek?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>, selling status is to France what Big Tech is to the US—three of France’s Top 4 most valuable companies are luxury brands. And LVMH is France’s Apple: Both industry behemoths sell wallet-busting products, thrive even amid economic downturns, and produce some of the most recognizable products of their home countries.

And if you need more proof that LVMH dominates, its owner Bernard Arnault is the world’s richest man, with a net worth of nearly $212 billion. He’s also set up a real-life succession battle among his children, who all hold key roles in the company.

But France’s high-end labels saw their stock prices soar in the first quarter of 2023 thanks to…

China’s reopening, which buoyed demand for products that help folks splurge and wear their wealth on their sleeves.

A strong euro and stable margins that ensure healthy profits.

Looking ahead…Though times have been good for the high-end, the luxury boom could slow if a recession hits and gets people thinking twice before dropping a car’s-worth of cash on a handbag.—SK

Everybody hates the Snapchat AI bot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ex?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Snapchat users really don't like the new "My AI" feature. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ex?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Francis Scialabba
Snapchat’s latest update has elicited the types of reviews typically reserved for a restaurant that just gave food poisoning to its entire dining room.

“My AI” is a ChatGPT-enabled bot that went live to Snapchat’s 750 million active users on Wednesday. The response: a wave of one-star app store reviews that sank Snapchat’s weekly average rating to 1.67.

The bot was immediately unpopular—Snap’s stock price took a hit as soon as it was announced last week (though it has since regained some ground). And now that people have had time to ask it some questions, the feature is, as one reviewer put it, “freaking kids and adults out.”

My AI seems to have more access to personal info than it’s letting on. Users report that, when asked, the bot says it doesn’t know their location…but it’s able to accurately suggest a nearby restaurant.

The bot also stays pinned to the top of the chat screen—you can’t get it out of sight unless you’re willing to pay $4 a month for Snapchat+. Even then—like the feeling of sending a photo meant for your significant other to your family—it can’t be deleted, just hidden.

Zoom out: Snapchat has a history of enraging its users with unpopular updates (remember the 2020 redesign <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ey?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>?), but these changes have actually resulted in a flurry of new users, data from Sensor Tower shows.—ML

Stat: Global military spending hit an unprecedented high of $2.2 trillion last year, thanks in part to the war in Ukraine and the ambitions of China, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But nobody spends on the military like the US spends <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5E5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>. The US’ $877 billion expenditure was three times bigger than the country with the next most lavish budget, China—and amounted to more cash than the next 10 biggest spenders paid out combined.

While most of the music industry seems to be panicked over “Heart on my Sleeve,” the viral AI-generated song by not-quite Drake and The (virtual) Weeknd, Grimes, for one, is taking it as inspiration for future collabs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5E6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> she doesn’t actually have to work on. The artist tweeted Sunday that she’d accept her standard agreement  for collaboration with other artists for AI-made jams and continued, “Feel free to use my voice without penalty. I have no label and no legal bindings.”

Good morning. What do very happy people in common? The Wall Street Journal called up the 12% of respondents in a WSJ-NORC survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> who called themselves “very happy”  and asked them what they were all about. Here are the traits they share.

Companionship: 67% of the happiest people said that marriage was very important to them, compared to 43% of overall respondents.

Religion: Two-thirds of very happy people characterized themselves as moderately or very religious. The overall share: less than half.

Closer to death: People 60 and over accounted for 44% of the happiest group, but represented 30% of total survey respondents.

Gym rats: Fitness was a common interest among very happy people.

What doesn’t seem to matter to being very happy? Political party affiliation or avoiding following politics.

Earnings season hasn’t dealt any surprises so far, but that may change with the busiest reporting week yet kicking off today.

Bed Bath & Bankrupt <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5ze?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> Store closing sale announcement at a Bed Bath & Beyond indoor mall in northern Idaho <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5ze?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> Don & Melinda Crawford/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
You have two days left to remember where you hoarded your 20%-off Bed Bath & Beyond coupons and redeem them. After limping along in poor financial health for years, the retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> on Sunday and said it would stop accepting its famous coupons on Wednesday.

Bed Bath & Beyond coupons are getting scrapped, and so are the stores that accept them. As part of its bankruptcy and liquidation, the company said it plans to close all of its 360 BB&B locations and its 120 Buybuy Baby stores by June 30—if a last-minute buyer doesn’t rescue it from going out of business.

A bad bet on private labels

You can’t blame this business failure on “economic uncertainty.” Numerous bad decisions by Bed Bath & Beyond management led to the chain’s demise, but the worst own-goal of all was its pivot to private-label products, or items that were made exclusively for Bed Bath & Beyond.

This effort was led by Mark Tritton, a former Target exec who was installed by activist investors in 2019. Tritton worked private-label magic at Target, releasing dozens of highly profitable Target-only lines that offered a promising roadmap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> for other retailers to follow.

But when Tritton tried to replicate his Target success at Bed Bath & Beyond, that strategy broke down like a cheap blender. In certain categories like kitchen appliances, brands matter, and shoppers stopped showing up to Bed Bath & Beyond after it swapped out KitchenAid mixers and OXO garlic mincers for its own stuff.

What happens next? A massive going-out-of-business sale <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> matched only by Toys R Us and Circuit City in the last 15 years, Axios notes.

Plus, if you’re one of the many individual investors who piled into Bed Bath & Beyond when it was a trendy meme stock last year, you’ll need to take your medicine and move on. In bankruptcy proceedings, debtholders get prioritized over shareholders, so meme-stock traders will be left holding the bag.

While the ultra-rich have been banking off this under-the-radar asset for centuries, a group of everyday investors just used it to rake in a whopping 325% annualized gain.

Sounds totally ridiculous? It definitely does. But it’s also 100% true.

The asset was a sculpture offered by the fractional art investment platform Masterworks. After just 36 days, investors profited a 15.4% net gain—a triple-digit return on an annualized basis.

While it’s not common for Masterworks to get a profitable exit that fast, every one of their 13 exits has returned a profit to investors, totaling more than $35 million in payouts.

In a joint statement, Shell acknowledged “an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret.” Shell was one of the most powerful figures in media, overseeing everything from Universal theme parks to NBC News and Bravo. He joins a list of other media execs, including CNN’s Jeff Zucker, who have stepped down over inappropriate relationships at work.

Dead celebrities get blue checkmarks on Twitter. Prominent people who are deceased, such as Chadwick Boseman, Barbara Walters, and Anthony Bourdain, have received a verification badge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zo?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> on Twitter that’s now reserved for accounts that pay $8/month for a subscription to Twitter Blue. A note from the company on their pages states that these celebs have paid for the subscription, even though they are…not alive. Twitter has also restored blue check marks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zp?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> to many other living celebrities who aren’t paying for Twitter Blue, either. So, what this all amounts to, seemingly, is that CEO Elon Musk is partially recreating the verification system he made a big deal of destroying.

Bud Light’s VP of marketing, Alissa Heinerscheid, and her boss, Daniel Blake, were placed on leave <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> following conservative backlash to a recent campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

Since she became the first woman ever to lead Bud Light’s marketing last June, Heinerscheid set out to revive the declining brand by appealing to women and younger people. Those efforts included a partnership <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer who promoted Bud Light’s March Madness giveaway on April 1 with a personalized can she’d been sent by the company.

This partnership did not sit well with many conservatives, who attacked Bud Light for being another corporation that went “woke” by prioritizing inclusivity. Kid Rock filmed himself shooting 12-packs of Bud Light, and other conservatives used social media to urge a boycott of the brand.

What’s Bud Light’s response been? Last week, the CEO of parent Anheuser-Busch released a non-statement statement, writing, “We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.” And yesterday’s shake-up shows it’s not happy with how the Mulvaney campaign went down. Along with sidelining the two execs, it’s changing its marketing department’s structure so that senior employees have more visibility ​​into all decisions.

The boycott appears to be having some effect on business. According to Beer Business Daily, Bud Light sales fell 10.7% the weekend ended April 8, while rival Molson Coors appears to have gotten at least a short-term lift.

 ✤ A Note From CIT Bank

CIT Bank is a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, Member FDIC. Platinum Savings is a tiered interest rate account. Interest is paid on the entire account balance based on the interest rate and APY in effect that day for the balance tier associated with the end-of-day account balance.

*Based on comparison to the national average Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on savings accounts as published in the FDIC National Rates and Rate Caps, accurate as of March 20, 2023.

**APYs — Annual Percentage Yields are accurate as of March 31, 2023: 0.25% APY on balances of $0.01 to $4,999.99; 4.75% APY on balances of $5,000.00 or more. Interest Rates for the Platinum Savings account are variable and may change at any time without notice. The minimum to open a Platinum Savings account is $100.

Good morning and Happy Earth Day. A lot had to go right for us to be living here.

First: location, location, location. Earth is located in a remote corner of the Milky Way. And while that means we have to Uber everywhere, it also means fewer threats like a huge star devouring us with its gravity. The star we do have nearby, the sun, is pretty stable and the perfect distance away to sustain liquid water (important!). And when the sun sends deadly flares our way, we’re safe because the Earth’s core produces a magnetic field that deflects radiation.

The Earth also contains critical elements like oxygen and carbon, its atmosphere traps heat (but not too much), its neighbor/protector Jupiter deflects asteroids and comets from smashing into it, its moon stabilizes the climate, and its active plate tectonic system produces volcanoes, whose eruptions may have led to the first instances of life.

Plus, it’s the only planet in the galaxy where you can get a good gyro.

HEALTH

SCOTUS upholds access to abortion pills…for now <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> Image of mifepristone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
In its first major ruling on abortion since overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court handed down a 7–2 decision <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> yesterday allowing mifepristone to remain widely available while the legal battle over the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of the abortion medication rages.

And it’s going to rage: The matter reached the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Texas yanked the FDA’s approval of the drug. That ruling would have blocked nationwide access to the medication, spooking pharmaceutical companies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> by raising the possibility that any drug approval could be nixed later. The government quickly appealed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected parts of the judge’s decision but still imposed restrictions on the medicine’s availability.

Meanwhile, the same day the Texas ruling came out, a Washington federal judge ordered the FDA not to restrict access to the pill in 17 states.

Plus, a generic drugmaker subsequently sued to keep its version of the pill on the market regardless of the Texas ruling.

The Supreme Court’s decision means the status quo will be maintained while that all gets sorted out.

But with the case all but guaranteed to end up back at the high court for a final say eventually, what it doesn’t do is tell us much about what the justices will ultimately decide when it gets there.

Why not? Because the brief, unsigned order came in response to an emergency petition, making it part of the court’s so-called shadow docket, where decisions get made quickly and without the benefit of oral arguments. Also, it’s pretty standard to block changes from taking place while appeals wind their way through the courts.

But there were a few hints: Both Justice Alito and Justice Thomas dissented from the order, saying they would have permitted the restrictions on the drug to take effect.

What comes next? The case is scheduled to pick back up with oral arguments at the 5th Circuit on May 17.—AR

In one example, a fake account with a paid-for blue check posing as a Sudanese paramilitary sent a tweet that got millions of views, which falsely said that its leader had been killed in the conflict there. Elsewhere on Twitter: All labels calling accounts “government-funded media” were removed (not just the recent controversial ones).

NFL’s biggest gambling crackdown. It’s not just the ponies getting people in trouble these days: The NFL suspended <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> five players, four of whom play for the Detroit Lions, for violating the league’s sports betting policy. Players are not allowed to bet on any NFL-related games or events, but can bet on non-NFL games as long as they aren’t on NFL turf. Three of the players, Quintez Cephus and C.J. Moore of the Lions and Shaka Toney of the Washington Commanders, were suspended indefinitely (through 2023 at least). Jameson Williams and Stanley Berryhill got shorter, six-game suspensions.

Parents will have to go back to criticizing their kids for excessive screen time or killing golf, because not owning a home is no longer an accurate roast. A new report from Redfin found that 30% of Gen Zers age 19–25 owned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> their own homes as of last year—which is higher than the 27% of Gen Xers and 28% of millennials that did at the same age.

Before all you 30-something renters freak out, most young homebuyers bought in cheap areas and jumped on low interest rates.

Gen Z’s favorite place to buy a house? Virginia Beach, VA, where they accounted for 9% of all home purchases last year. The median house sale price for a Gen Z buyer in the area was $255,000 in 2022…$199,525 less than the  average median sale price in the US last year, according to the St. Louis Fed.

It also comes down to timing. Gen Zers entered a tight labor market with high wages, while millennials had to wade through the fallout of the 2008 recession before they were able to establish themselves financially.

Looking ahead…with interest rate hikes pushing mortgage rates past 6% this year and supply tightening, Gen Zers may not keep up their homebuying pace.—MM

Fallon / Getty Images
California’s historic snowfall this year helped pull the state out of a drought and blessed our feeds with photos of snowy palm trees...but now it’s starting to melt, setting up a summer of flooding.

Officials warn that warmer temperatures will cause the massive snowpack <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> atop the Sierra Nevadas to overflow reservoirs, spilling into lakes and valleys that are already buckling under last month’s storms. To give you an idea of just how much melted snow there’ll be, it’s enough to submerge 30 million football fields under a foot of water.

Where’s all that water going?

The biggest threat is to downstream communities to the west of the Sierra Nevadas, and in some valleys to the east.

California’s San Joaquin Valley stands to suffer most from impending floods, which could last through the year.

The mountainside counties of Fresno, Kings, and Tulare–which has a recently revived lake <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5y-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> that’s already damaged hundreds of buildings–are under a flood warning until further notice.

It won’t happen all at once: Temps these next few days are forecast to hit the 80s, causing some melt, but the true danger will be 90-degree June days.

Big picture: With an estimated 98% of the snowpack still up there, Central Californians are bracing for a very wet year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5y_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> that could cost billions in infrastructure and agricultural damages.—ML

It’s only champagne if it comes from the Champagne region of France; otherwise it’s just sparkling wine—or in this case lager.

The brand, which doesn’t export to Europe, didn’t object, but said, “We invite our friends in Europe to the US any time to toast the High Life together.”

Good morning. It’s Good Friday, which is a market holiday but not a federal holiday. That will result in a highly unusual scenario: When the government releases the pivotal jobs report this morning, the stock market won’t be open to react to it. Investors will have to spend three days marinating in the details before placing their wagers on Monday. Maybe there’s a moral to this story about resisting knee-jerk reactions, but we’ll leave that for LinkedIn...

When your billionaire friend invites you on their yacht for an island-hopping adventure, you reply, “omw.”

Well, unless you’re a Supreme Court justice—then you might want to think twice.

Clarence Thomas apparently didn’t get the memo because, according to a bombshell ProPublica report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9b343d70> published yesterday, the conservative Supreme Court justice has been whisked around on luxury vacations for 20+ years by the Dallas-based real estate mogul and GOP megadonor Harlan Crow. These gifted vacations, which Thomas didn’t disclose, have alarmed ethics watchdogs and spurred calls by senators to create a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.

Currently, the SCOTUS justices are the only federal judges <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7353fdf1> who aren’t officially tied to a code of conduct, according to Bloomberg. However, they are required to report when they travel on a private jet (which Thomas did with Crow) and stay at commercial properties like resorts. Since Thomas didn’t disclose these gifts, ethics experts told ProPublica that he appears to have violated the law.

Got my toes in the water…

What were these luxury vacations Thomas took on Crow’s dime? Some include…

Nine days on a megayacht in Indonesia, a trip that would have cost Thomas and his wife $500,000+ had they paid for it themselves, ProPublica wrote.

Summer stays at Crow’s estate in the Adirondacks, Camp Topridge, where Thomas reportedly came into contact with execs at Verizon and PwC, as well as big GOP donors.

In a statement to ProPublica, Crow said that Thomas never asked to be taken on vacations, and his invites were “no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends.”

But a SCOTUS justice is not like Crow’s other friends, in that they are expected to avoid any appearance of outside influence in order to maintain public trust in the institution. The revelation that Thomas accepted secret gifts from the ultrawealthy shows that he “seems to have completely disregarded his higher ethical obligations,” former government ethics lawyer Virginia Canter told ProPublica.—NF

When McDonald’s cut hundreds of corporate jobs this week, it utilized a pandemic trend that’s still going strong: remote layoffs. The fast-food giant closed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0ee558cb> corporate offices Monday–Wednesday to remotely lay off a slice of its 45,000 US (and some international) white-collar workers.

Telling an employee their position has been eliminated in front of a blurred Zoom background has gotten a lot more common since waves of corporate workers ditched their offices at the onset of the pandemic. But in turning to remote layoffs, some companies have made an awful situation even awful-er:

When Twitter closed its offices to cut nearly 3,700 staffers in November, some employees reported losing access to work emails and Slack in the middle of the night prior to receiving an emailed pink slip.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, chaotically laid off <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UU0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb791de66> 6% of its staff in January via email.

Better.com’s CEO infamously laid off 900 employees in a virtual town hall in December 2021.

HR experts have mixed feelings. Some argue that finding out the bad news in the comfort of your home is a better alternative to packing up your office plants while catching coworker side-eyes. Plus, why drag someone into the office only to send them back home? But others say email and Zoom are impersonal and relieve managers of taking responsibility for layoffs.

What’s going on? All types of games—from analog to digital—are surging in popularity, and Hollywood wants some of that Coin.

The video game industry made about $320 billion last year—levels above what TV and movies earn—and the industry will be worth $482 billion in 2027, Statista estimates.

Board games aren’t quite as lucrative ($11 billion to $13 billion in annual sales) but are growing at a similar clip. The tabletop RPG Dungeons & Dragons had over 50 million players as of 2020, and its audience was growing 33% annually.

Sting has said that Diddy never asked him for permission to sample his song until “after the fact,” but it seems to have worked out because now he’s raking in $1.8 million a year in passive income. Of course, Sting doesn’t really need Diddy’s royalties—he sold his music catalog to Universal Records for ~$300 million last year.

NPR, which usually plays the role of soft-spoken sidekick, was the main character of yesterday’s Twitter drama. The social media platform put a “US state-affiliated media <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TWs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Caf2f04c8>” tag on NPR’s account, a loaded label that suggests it’s an accessory to the US government.

Some background: Twitter started using the label in the pre-Elon Musk days of 2020 for transparency, defining state-affiliated media as “outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content.” Up until Tuesday night, its policy explicitly said that state-funded media operating with editorial independence, like the BBC and…NPR did not fall into the category. But, like a newly dumped ex cleansing their grid, Twitter seems to have deleted all mentions of NPR from the policy.

Why now? Twitter, which has no PR department, hasn’t said why it started lumping NPR in with news sites notorious for spreading government propaganda, like China Daily and Russia Today. But Musk tweeted, “Seems accurate” in response to a tweet about the new label.

Whatever Twitter’s reasons, NPR’s chief communications officer told <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TWw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7877b21f> the NYT that less than 1% of the org’s yearly operating budget comes from government-funded grants. Most of the organization’s funding comes from individual and business donations. Other media orgs that receive substantial government funding, like Voice of America and the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes, don’t have the label, the Washington Post noted.

The label’s addition not only suggests to the NPR account’s 8.8 million Twitter followers (and anyone who views it) that its reporting is less than credible, but it also means NPR will not be amplified via Twitter’s recommendation algorithm.

This is part of a pattern for Musk’s Twitter: The site recently took away the main New York Times account’s verification badge while leaving them on for other news outlets after the Times said it wouldn’t pay for the blue check. And several reporters who criticized Musk had their accounts suspended last year.—MM

When it comes to burrito bowls named after a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper, fast-casual chain Chipotle believes Highlander-style there can only be one. Just in time for today’s National Burrito Day promotion, the Mexican grill slapped its rival for lunchtime supremacy, Sweetgreen, with a trademark lawsuit <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TXI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5a4d8ad6> over the salad spot’s new “Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl.”

The suit, filed in California federal court Tuesday, claims Sweetgreen is trying to take advantage of customer goodwill toward the Chipotle brand. It further maintains that Sweetgreen has advertised the new bowl using the word “Chipotle” in the font and style used for Chipotle’s logo and deployed an ad background color similar to the brand’s trademarked Adobo Red hue.

In a press release introducing the new menu item last week, Sweetgreen said it was named for the “thoughtfully-sourced chipotle powder that provides the perfect slightly spicy, smokey bite.” But Chipotle’s legal complaint asserts that industry publications—and even Sweetgreen’s own social media comments—have noted the similarity to Chipotle’s offerings.

Big picture: News of the lawsuit sent Sweetgreen’s stock plunging yesterday. It ended the day down 6.26%—another setback for the salad-maker, whose shares are down ~20% in 2023 so far as it struggles to turn a profit. Chipotle, meanwhile, has seen its stock surge 24% this year thanks to strong sales.—AR

Artificial intelligence is being used to create Balenciaga-fied versions of movies and TV shows—a lucky hit of positive publicity for the high-fashion brand that was wrapped up in scandals last year.

A timeline for those of you out touching grass:

And about two weeks ago, an AI-generated photo of Pope Francis <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Qlk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cafae9623> in a Balenciaga coat went mega-viral on Twitter after first being posted on Reddit and Facebook.

How do they do it? By using AI image generators such as Midjourney and AI voice generators like Eleven Labs—which Abandoned Films tagged in the LOTR video where a snatched Boromir says, “One does not simply walk into a Balenciaga fashion show.”

Stat: Despite advice to the contrary from every personal finance guru on the internet, most people don’t ask for more money when they’re offered a job: 58% of men and 61% of women said they didn’t when they were last hired, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TVU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce552f5a2>. But even when they do ask for more cash, women are less likely to get it than men are.

Quote: “Queen Camilla”

We expected the biggest news about the invitations to the coronation for the UK’s King Charles III to be whether one made its way to Harry and Meghan’s mailbox in Montecito, but the wording of the invite itself is also getting headlines <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TUg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc7f6e1cc>. Why? Because it refers to monarch’s wife as “Queen Camilla” rather than as “Queen Consort,” the title she has been using since Queen Elizabeth’s death. Given Camilla’s sometimes fraught relationship with the British press and public (and the late Princess Diana), only 7% of Britons thought she should become queen when the pair married in 2005—so her first official use of the title is drawing some attention.
