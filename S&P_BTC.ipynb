There is a general rule of thumb that follows. As the traditional banking system is collapsing, people have less confidence in it. That is when they turn to cryptocurrency, as an alternative to that same system. Therefore the price grows, as the demand increases.\n",

The logic behind this is the following. By taking those dates out of the dataframes for Bitcoin and S&P500 (effectively eliminating that data), we would get a clearer picture. That is because the general trend would be more pronounced, as there would be less cases of the variables growing in opposite directions."

This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends August 31, 2023.\n",

Big Tech critic Scott Galloway, an NYU professor, declared <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a48?mblid=1fcf4c990234&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2019 that Facebook “intentionally drives our society apart” by “deepening users’ beliefs & magnifying outrage.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In one study, the researchers swapped out an algorithmic feed for a reverse chronological feed for tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users, which meant changing the type of posts from what the company wanted users to see to a stream of posts the company did not put its thumb on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes had no impact on political polarization, and even led users to see more untrustworthy content. Another side effect: The chronological feed also made people bored and, consequently, spend less time on the platform.\n",

In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.\n",

      "Watching Oppenheimer in a standard movie theater is kind of like eating “New York-style pizza” in a Dallas strip mall. It gets the job done, but it’s not the pinnacle of the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For that, you’d have to travel to one of 30 IMAX theaters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D4?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8ea10732fb81> around the world equipped to project Nolan’s 70-millimeter print of the film. Nineteen of those screens are in the US, while 11 are abroad in Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Czech Republic. The one I’m trying (and failing) to get a ticket to, the AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City, measures 97 feet wide and 76 feet tall.\n",

      "Nolan told the AP <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D5?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a86b37aaa126> that seeing Oppenheimer on one of these 30 screens makes for the “best possible experience” because they’re the only ones with the aspect ratios that can faithfully capture the resolution he shot the film in. An IMAX devotee since The Dark Night, Nolan used 65mm cameras for Oppenheimer that are among the highest-resolution cameras in existence. Consider: The HD screen on your home TV has 1,920 pixels of resolution per frame, while the IMAX resolution has 18,000 pixels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But all that clarity takes up a lot of physical space, making the film stock a logistical challenge for theaters to project. The Oppenheimer film stock weighs about 600 pounds and spans more than 11 miles; at NYC’s Lincoln Square, they used a forklift to pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why most people who see Oppenheimer will catch the standard digital presentation. And that, according to Nolan, will be just fine.—NF\n",

      "Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. The claim Pays For Itself is based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Fees range from $2-8k a year and may increase based on complexity of a member's financial picture.\n",

JWST is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and since last July, it has sent back dozens of snapshots of the cosmos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lc?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4858f6b02d98> to remind us just how small we really are.\n",

      "The hills are alive with the sound of silence. If a tree doesn’t fall in the woods, new research suggests that we’d still consider its lack of sound to be…a sound. A Johns Hopkins study has found that people hear silence as a kind of sound rather than an absence of noise. Researchers discovered this by running “sonic illusions,” which typically compare one moment of noise to two shorter moments of noise that together last the same amount of time. Listeners tend to wrongly perceive the uninterrupted moment as lasting longer, and the same thing happened when the single moment of noise was subbed out for silence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9le?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6361738ba12b>.

The FTC argued that the takeover would result in less competition in the video game industry and limit access to Activision’s blockbuster games, but the judge disagreed, saying, “To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.” While the deal still needs UK regulators’ approval, they also signaled yesterday they would let it proceed.\n",

A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management.

America’s largest private-sector package delivery service and the Teamsters Union representing 340,000 of its workers accused each other of walking away from negotiations over pay yesterday. The union plans to go on strike if a deal isn’t reached before the current contract expires on July 31, a move that could hobble supply chains and weigh on the US economy. Rivals like FedEx might benefit from picking up extra business, but they would likely struggle to take on all the 20 million packages that UPS handles daily.\n",

It’s encased fury, but not anger so much as tension and energy. But the real takeaway for me is the dynamic between Joey and the crowd, the energy that comes back to the stage from the crowd is incredible. And so when I think of Joey eating, I’m sort of outside of that loop. But I’m right near that loop. And that loop is incredible.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.\n",

The strange happenings spawned speculation that the government was covering up an alien visit to the town, and some diehard believers refused to drop the idea of little green men even after the Air Force admitted decades later that the “UFOs” were actually its spycraft.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Newsweek he’s treating the claims seriously since they come from people with “high clearances and high positions within our government.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* “I just believe it in my heart,” Republican Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett said of the possibility that the US has found extraterrestrial aircraft. He says his views on the matter are based on conversations he’s had with military pilots.\n",

      "\n",

      "Every July 1, retired All-Star third baseman Bobby Bonilla receives a $1.19 million check from his former team, the New York Mets, even though he hasn’t played an MLB game in more than 20 years. The reason is that back in 2000, the Mets owed Bonilla $5.9 million, but instead of taking that cash up front, Bonilla worked out a contract that spreads out $30 million in guaranteed payments to him through annual installments from 2011–2035.\n",

Carnival (up 136% YTD) and Royal Caribbean (up 113%) were among the top five gainers in the S&P 500 for the first half of the year (alongside Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla) as people went back on vacation at sea and they recovered from pandemic lows.

      "A solstice occurs when one of the Earth’s poles (today, it’s the north) tilts toward the sun at the maximum angle. The two solstices, in December and June, mark the beginning of winter and summer and give us the longest days and nights of the year.\n",

The planned purchase surpasses the previous record for an aircraft deal, set by Air India for 470 planes earlier this year, and will more than double IndiGo’s fleet, which currently stands at 300. That this is the second record-breaking aviation deal by an Indian airline in six months is no coincidence—the country is gearing up for a spike in air travel demand due to immense population growth and sustained interest in travel post-pandemic.\n",

A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.\n",

      "  Can congestion pricing curb NYC traffic? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York traffic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Alexander Spatari/Getty Images New Yorkers know the rules: Skip the small talk, limit the grocery run to what you can haul to a sixth-floor walk-up, and avoid getting behind the wheel in the city at all costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the costs of driving are only getting higher: NYC is getting closer to charging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hM?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=da40a3e27f9d> people for driving downtown in an attempt to curb rush-hour traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Known as congestion pricing, the fee is meant to encourage commuters to ditch their cars for the train or bus while raising cash to improve public transit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a public review period ended Monday, the city is waiting for the final go-ahead from federal authorities to roll out the first congestion charge in a US city as early as next spring. And, as they say, if congestion pricing can make it here, it...will probably spread to other US cities looking to smother traffic and boost revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy has helped unclog roads in places like London, Stockholm, and Singapore, and transit wonks in the US are eager to see whether it will catch on here. But, as with anything else, New Yorkers have strong opinions—many of them negative. So, let’s break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how this would work\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cars driving into Manhattan anywhere below 60th Street (the area dubbed the central business district) would face a daily toll.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* The exact amount isn’t known yet, but it could be anywhere from $9 to $23 per day for passenger cars, with a reduced fee in off times and a possible discount for low-income drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The MTA expects the congestion charge to reduce the number of cars on the road by up to 20%. And the move is expected to make Manhattan’s air cleaner and its streets safer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the fees would raise $1 billion a year, according to the NYC comptroller, and the MTA could use the money to improve service for its trains and buses. With the country’s largest transit system struggling to make ends meet, the fee touted as a win-win.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But is the toll too steep?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people are upset about paying to endure Manhattan’s gridlock (even if congestion pricing will raise the average rush-hour speed, which is currently about 7 mph). Some critics say it could hurt low-income drivers, while others worry about potential losses for businesses in the central business district that rely on commercial vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Outer borough residents aren’t thrilled, either. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican from New York who represents Staten Island, called it a “cash grab” by the MTA and expressed concern that drivers would bypass the tolls by driving through the borough. The MTA acknowledges that the pricing scheme will likely cause more congestion in other parts of town and pollution (the agency has proposed pollution mitigation strategies).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But non-city dwellers might be the least chill with New York’s plan: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lashed out at the measure this week, saying it amounts to a tax on NJ residents who already pay tolls to drive into Manhattan for work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pushback to the pushback\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Congestion pricing will not make the sky fall,” Nicholas J. Klein, assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, told Morning Brew, since most people already travel into the area via public transit, walking, or biking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Associate Professor of Urban Planning at UCLA Michael Manville noted that most people traveling to Manhattan by car can afford the extra charge as they’re already willing to shell out a fortune for parking. And he emphasizes that those who will pay the congestion toll will benefit from a zippier commute.\n",

      "4 key takeaways from the report\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Energy is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Cheaper energy played a major role <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86R?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6806bc4bef9> in pulling inflation down to 4% last month from 4.9% in April, per Axios. Gas prices plunged almost 20% from last year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fuel costs to the moon, while broader energy prices fell nearly 12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. “Revenge spending” is down. Once pandemic lockdowns lifted, Americans splurged on vacations, leisure, and recreation (new pickleball paddles!) in what economists dubbed “revenge spending.” Now that everyone has taken their weeklong trip to Italy, there are signs that revenge spending is waning: Airfare prices dropped 13% annually in May and, according to the US Travel Association, hotel demand is below 2019 levels. Bad for your Insta, but good for inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Food prices are up. The cost of food ticked up 0.2% in May from April after staying flat in the previous two months, showing how inflation has persisted on grocery store shelves. But not all aisles are created equal—the price of eggs dropped nearly 14% from April (the biggest one-month drop since 1951), while fruit and veggie prices rose 1.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. More than anything else, rent is propping up inflation. Shelter costs are the largest category in the CPI report, and they’re still on the upward march, climbing 8.7% from a year earlier. The good news: Economists say this government data doesn’t reflect on-the-ground information, such as reports of softening rent by Zillow and Apartment List. Shelter costs in the CPI are expected to decline during the second half of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead…later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a pause in interest rate hikes after 10 consecutive increases.

But Colorado natives Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the duo behind South Park, knew this place was too special to gather cobwebs. So, in 2021, they paid $3.1 million to buy Casa Bonita, and then spent up to $40 million (!) renovating it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y3?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc38a14ecd89> ahead of its reopening, which is set to happen in the next few weeks, the NYT reported.\n",

      "You may recognize the city of Cupertino from your iPhone’s weather app, but you’re probably not as familiar with Apple Park, the company’s global headquarters since 2017. So, let’s learn a little bit more about one of the most famous office buildings in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of Apple Park as you would any other Apple product: sleek and extra at the same time. It was conceived of by co-founder Steve Jobs and meticulously laid out by Apple’s legendary chief designer, Jony Ive, in conjunction with the architectural firm Foster + Partners. Jobs even said the building’s circular shape “resembles the circular dial on an iPod” (but sadly without that clicking sound).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about the shape, because not many offices could be compared to a spaceship. Apple Park’s distinctive ring extends almost one mile in circumference, which is necessary because it’s built for over 12,000 employees to work there (more than the undergrad population of nearby Stanford). And the “walls” are walls in name only—the building is enclosed by towering curved glass pieces four stories high that can slide open when there’s good weather in Cupertino. And there’s typically good weather in Cupertino.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, Jobs’s most lasting imprint on the campus is the room that’s named after him: the Steve Jobs Theater. This 1,000-seat auditorium used for events and product launches is covered by the largest carbon-fiber roof in the world, according to its architects, and doesn’t have even one column holding it up.\n",

The winner of the first men’s race of the day, Matt Crolla, told the AP how he prepares: “I don’t think you can train for it, can you? It’s just being an idiot.”\n",

A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management.

      "How lounges became for the people\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in the day, airline lounges resembled snooty gentlemen’s clubs reserved for VIP business travelers and folks willing to pay top dollar to fly first class.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Things began to change in 1985 when American Express introduced the first credit card that came with access to private clubs around the world as a way to lure traveling customers. This paved the way for the democratization of airport lounges a couple decades later as travel cards began to adopt complimentary access as a perk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The advent of networks like Priority Pass, which began in the 1990s, and Centurion Lounges launched by American Express in 2013 allowed people to access lounges without having to commit to flying with a specific airline. These networks offer subscription plans, and some lounges allow people to enter on a pay-per-visit basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many savvy travelers find a $99 annual charge and a $35 entry fee for Priority Pass to be financially prudent given how eye-poppingly high airport food prices tend to be. And options for getting in abound: Today, Nerdwallet lists 19 different cards available in the US that open lounge doors, one even coming with a no annual fee intro offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the number of lounges has swelled to 3,000 around the globe, many of them operated not by airlines but by the credit card companies themselves. Demand for the pleasant preboarding hangout spots has far outstripped supply. And the flight delays and cancellations that have been plaguing aviation for the past couple years mean many folks are spending longer waiting around…and taking up lounge space.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But there’s a counterrevolution happening\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Airlines still rely on first-class passengers for much of their revenue. As travel continues to recover from the Covid slump, these businesses need to make sure that prized customers have a superb experience not just on the plane but when they’re waiting to board—and trying to sip a preflight martini while being swarmed by sweaty plebes isn’t going to cut it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, companies are taking pains to make lounge air rarefied again:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* Delta announced last fall that only frequent fliers would be able to purchase Sky Club lounge privileges.\n",

It’s believed that a female orca named White Gladis experienced a “critical moment of agony,” such as getting tangled in illegal fishing gear, which turned her against boats. Because orcas are social creatures that imitate each other (relatable), other killer whales in the population started to copy White Gladis and ram into boats, specifically to damage the rudder.\n",

      "Big picture: Since 2020, when the orca attacks started to ramp up, the vast majority of their encounters with boats in the region have been harmless, biologist Alfredo López Fernandez told Live Science. Still, the increasing frequency of ramming attacks threatens the safety of sailors and the subpopulation of orcas off the Iberian coast, which are critically endangered.\n",

In the video, Powell can be seen answering questions about inflation and the economy in ways that were consistent with his other statements—though the Fed said the video appears to have been edited and cannot confirm its accuracy.

      "\n",
      "\n",

Since 1967, the theme park has existed harmoniously with the greater Orlando area as a special tax district, allowing it to essentially act as its own county.

      "\n",
      "Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against Fox, which the network settled less than a week ago for $787.5 million, made Carlson’s private text messages public—including some that criticized Fox’s senior leadership. Those messages played a role in his departure from Fox, per the Washington Post.\n",

Wells was let go along with Carlson, and, according to the LA Times, Grossberg’s lawsuit was the main factor in the decision, handed down by Rupert Murdoch, to fire Carlson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Lemon made headlines in February for saying that “a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s,” and more recently had combative interviews with some guests. According to the New York Times, Lemon’s future at CNN “had become untenable.”\n",

It’s not entirely surprising: Tucker Carlson Tonight was as synonymous with Fox as Law & Order is to NBC. It has been one of the top shows on cable news and regularly drew more than 3 million nightly viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For CNN, firing Lemon, who had been at the network for 17 years, is one of many recent moves in programming as the network tries to catch up with its competitors. As cable news viewership continues to decrease, all the major networks are launching new shows and overhauling programming to try to recapture the ratings glory days of 2015.—CC\n",

Uncertain of his next move this winter, Rodgers famously entered a darkness retreat in Oregon, and apparently left the experience with the desire to pay a lot more for housing. Rodgers’s move from Green Bay to New York near the end of his career is reminiscient of Brett Favre’s trade to the Jets 15 years ago, which allowed a young Rodgers to take the reins at Lambeau Field.\n",

Sting has said that Diddy never asked him for permission to sample his song until “after the fact,” but it seems to have worked out because now he’s raking in $1.8 million a year in passive income. Of course, Sting doesn’t really need Diddy’s royalties—he sold his music catalog to Universal Records for ~$300 million last year.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background: Twitter started using the label in the pre-Elon Musk days of 2020 for transparency, defining state-affiliated media as “outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content.” Up until Tuesday night, its policy explicitly said that state-funded media operating with editorial independence, like the BBC and…NPR did not fall into the category. But, like a newly dumped ex cleansing their grid, Twitter seems to have deleted all mentions of NPR from the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why now? Twitter, which has no PR department, hasn’t said why it started lumping NPR in with news sites notorious for spreading government propaganda, like China Daily and Russia Today. But Musk tweeted, “Seems accurate” in response to a tweet about the new label.\n",

Most of the organization’s funding comes from individual and business donations. Other media orgs that receive substantial government funding, like Voice of America and the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes, don’t have the label, the Washington Post noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The label’s addition not only suggests to the NPR account’s 8.8 million Twitter followers (and anyone who views it) that its reporting is less than credible, but it also means NPR will not be amplified via Twitter’s recommendation algorithm.\n",

      "\n",

      "This is part of a pattern for Musk’s Twitter: The site recently took away the main New York Times account’s verification badge while leaving them on for other news outlets after the Times said it wouldn’t pay for the blue check.

      "Stat: Despite advice to the contrary from every personal finance guru on the internet, most people don’t ask for more money when they’re offered a job: 58% of men and 61% of women said they didn’t when they were last hired, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TVU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce552f5a2>. But even when they do ask for more cash, women are less likely to get it than men are.

      "We expected the biggest news about the invitations to the coronation for the UK’s King Charles III to be whether one made its way to Harry and Meghan’s mailbox in Montecito, but the wording of the invite itself is also getting headlines <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TUg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc7f6e1cc>. Why? Because it refers to monarch’s wife as “Queen Camilla” rather than as “Queen Consort,” the title she has been using since Queen Elizabeth’s death. Given Camilla’s sometimes fraught relationship with the British press and public (and the late Princess Diana), only 7% of Britons thought she should become queen when the pair married in 2005—so her first official use of the title is drawing some attention.\n",
