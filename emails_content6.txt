Good morning. Cocaine Bear has only been in theaters for one week but a potential sequel has already emerged: Cocaine Hippo. It wouldn’t be about a hippo on cocaine, but instead about the community of hippos that’s flourished in Colombia thanks to Pablo Escobar. In the late 1970s, the cocaine kingpin imported four hippos to his estate, and in the decades since those four have multiplied into a small village of 130.

Now, with hippos considered an invasive species in Colombia, authorities want to capture 70 and send them to sanctuaries abroad. Elizabeth Banks—you have our number.

Amazon’s HQ2 is starting to look more like HQ1.5. The e-commerce giant announced yesterday that it’s halting the construction of its much-hyped second headquarters in Arlington, VA.

Construction status update

The first part of the project, Metropolitan Park, is on track for a ribbon cutting this summer.

Breaking ground on the swanky office park known as PenPlace, which would encompass three 22-story towers and a sleek helix-shaped building, has been put off indefinitely.

Met Park can accommodate 14,000 workers, which is more than enough for Amazon’s 8,000 local employees. And headcount is unlikely to skyrocket any time soon: Amazon began laying off 18,000 employees in January (the steepest job cuts in its history).

Plans and promises

Amazon chose the DC area as the site of its HQ2 in 2018, after a cutthroat bidding battle among dozens of cities nationwide that resembled the municipal version of The Bachelor.

The company promised to bring 25,000 jobs to the region and turbocharge the local economy in exchange for $800 million in tax benefits and infrastructure improvements.

It says it does plan to build PenPlace and reach the workforce goal eventually. But for now, it’s not short on office space: Its employees still spend a lot of time working from home, even after a recent companywide mandate to come into the office three days a week.

The company is also reducing its physical footprint elsewhere. It vacated an office tower in its hometown, Seattle, earlier this year.

Zoom out: Amazon’s pause on its Northern Virginia expansion is part of a bigger trend. Big Tech companies like Meta and Twitter have cut down on their real estate footprint to save money. And it’s just one of the many ominous signs for the commercial real estate market since people no longer go into the office every workday.—SK

The British government has been trying to woo the company to relist in London, and Arm said it wasn’t ruling out a future London IPO. But it’s a big loss for London for now, and it heightens concerns that the UK market is not competitive internationally. Investment bankers are pegging the company’s valuation between $30 billion and $70 billion, per Bloomberg.

Walgreens said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30728929.102437/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY3Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcyODkyOS4xMDI0Mzc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca5f42208> Thursday that it will not distribute abortion pills in 20 states, including ones where the drugs are legal. The announcement follows a threat from those states’ Republican attorneys general to take legal action against the pharmacy if it sold the drug mifepristone.

Medication abortions account for more than half of all legal abortions in the US, and mifepristone is part of a popular two-drug process. In a bid to expand abortion access after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the FDA decided in January that approved drug stores could carry mifepristone—which had previously only been available at clinics.

Walgreens, the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US, said it would work to become one of those pharmacies, but quickly saw pushback from anti-abortion lawmakers. Now, the company says it won’t sell the pill in those states, either in its stores or by mail, even though the FDA also said mifepristone could be mailed to states with abortion bans.

If you’ve been waiting a year to hear Chris Rock’s hot take on that little incident at the Oscars, tonight’s the night.

Live TV events where anything can happen are still drawing eyeballs even as more viewers are binge-watching shows on their own timetable (15 million people were watching when Will Smith attacked Rock as he hosted last year’s awards gala). And now, a week before this year’s Oscars, Netflix is betting that everybody doesn’t hate Chris as it rolls out its first-ever live-streaming event for its 231 million subscribers.

Rock’s special is called Selective Outrage, and it’s expected to be a version of the show he’s been touring with (which, yes, has included jokes about The Slap), but tonight he’ll have 13 cameras on him as he riffs in Baltimore. Netflix has good reason to think Rock’s stand-up can deliver virtual viewers: The shows have been taking in about $700,000 per night from ticket sales, according to the concert trade publication Pollstar.

Zoom out: Rock may be Netflix’s live event guinea pig, but it’s not the only streamer to turn to the old TV staple. Amazon Prime has also gone all in, paying ~$1 billion/year to broadcast Thursday Night Football.—AR

Between 2010 and 2020, 31% of kids who checked into the university hospital’s burn center with injuries said instant noodles were the cause. To reduce the risk, the researchers suggest having an adult take the noodle cup out of the microwave and then keep it from the kids until it cools down a bit.

Ford reassured everyone this week that it has no plans to go full Repo Man after filing a patent for cars that repossess themselves. The company’s patent application <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30728929.102437/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY0c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcyODkyOS4xMDI0Mzc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccb423138> describes a system where the bank can remotely shut down the air conditioner, the radio, and ultimately the car itself if a lessee fails to keep up with car payments. It even includes self-driving cars that bring themselves to impound lots. But Ford says it routinely files patents and they don’t necessarily mean the products are  coming out.

Good morning. On Wednesday, we asked you to channel Larry David and discuss whether it’s socially acceptable for two people dining together to order the same dish. And after reviewing your responses over the last two days, it’s clear that people are pretty split on this:

Readers against duplicative ordering talked about the delight of sharing food and the need to “cover your bases” when going to a restaurant (especially a new one).

Readers who said it was OK to order the same dish argued it’s unfair to the person who orders second, and, look—eating at a restaurant is supposed to be fun, not a chore…so don’t stress. Order what you want.

And then there’s Regina B.: “My whole group of eight has ordered the same thing.”

It’s no secret that the government considers TikTok a national security threat. But in an interview with Bloomberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zN1o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cee8295dd> yesterday, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo suggested that the government is concerned about the dangers posed by other Chinese apps, too.

“If what we’re worried about is Chinese-backed companies being on tens of millions of American phones, including members of the military and privacy concerns, data concerns, misinformation concerns—it doesn’t just apply to TikTok,” she said.

Thing is, Chinese apps are the most popular apps in the US right now. The top three free apps on Apple’s App Store yesterday were Temu, CapCut, and TikTok, while Google Play’s were Temu, TikTok, and Street Fighter: Duel—with Chinese fast-fashion company Shein chilling at No. 4.

Except for Street Fighter, all of these apps are based in China and have been downloaded onto American devices hundreds of millions of times.

CapCut is a video editor for TikTok owned by the same tech giant, ByteDance.

Temu is a shopping app that was already gaining traction in the US late last year but boarded a rocket ship to the most-downloaded spot after airing two spots for its “Shop Like a Billionaire” commercial during the Super Bowl.

For now, TikTok has the biggest target <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zNy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9f185885> on its back:

Legislation to ban TikTok in the US was approved by an influential House committee this week, though it still has to face trials by fire with the full House and Senate.

Government agencies have 30 days from Feb. 27 to ensure TikTok is deleted from all federal devices and systems.

Experts can’t agree on whether Chinese apps are a threat

An exec at the think tank founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote last month <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zN18_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb49438b8> that all of these uber-popular Chinese apps, including the messenger WeChat and game apps from Tencent, “could pose similar challenges [to TikTok], particularly with respect to data harvesting, data exploitation, and—possibly—covert influence.”

But others say the fears are #ghosttok-level overblown…and judging by the apps’ enormous number of downloads, the average American ain’t afraid of no posts. For all the scrutiny of TikTok, technologist and author Kevin Xu wrote <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zODA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7e26e3b8>, “US legislators, policymakers, and think-tankers have yet to produce any concrete evidence of harm done by the app.”—JW

Mortgage rates are spiking…again.

While mortgage rates fell earlier this winter, they’re jumping again in response to strong economic growth and hot inflation data, which could signal more interest rate hikes from the Fed. Higher mortgage rates combined with already astronomical home prices have led to the most unaffordable housing market on record, per Bloomberg.

The case drew national attention due to the Murdaugh family’s powerful influence in the local area and Alex Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes (which prosecutors claimed motivated the murders: He wanted to gain sympathy and avoid investigations into his financial misdeeds). Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison for each murder charge.

Progress on the gender pay gap has stalled.

That’s just a slight uptick from the 80% women earned relative to men 20 years before, in 2002. The study shows how the progress made on the gender pay gap in the late 20th century has petered out in 21st, despite women now having higher educational attainment than men. In 1982, women earned an average of 65% of what men earned.

Double it and give it to the next year. California has already received twice the average snowfall it normally sees by March, according to UC Berkeley researchers. Some mountainous regions have been slammed with 40 feet of snow since the start of winter.

But just in the last week, California has been hit with an obscene amount of fresh pow. On Wednesday, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for 13 counties, including San Bernardino—where some towns will likely be cut off from the rest of the state for weeks.

California’s Joshua Tree National Park closed on Wednesday because of inclement weather. And there’s no reopening date in sight for Yosemite National Park, which has been shut down since Saturday.

For ski resorts, it’s too much of a good thing. Mountain High in Southern California averages 67 inches of snowfall every season. But its slopes received 93 inches (about eight feet) last week alone. Unfortunately, Mountain High and other SoCal resorts are still snowed in and are at the mercy of unplowed highways.

Turns out there are more cons to living near a bourbon distillery than just the obvious (having a million gingham shirt bachelor-party guys stumble around your neighborhood every year).

An out-of-control, soot-like whiskey fungus is spreading in Tennessee and causing a rift <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zOGQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C77560b1e> between residents and famed whiskey-maker Jack Daniel’s.

The fungus, named Baudoinia compniacensis after a distiller who first made note of it in the 1870s, feeds off of ethanol vapors released during the whiskey aging process. For months, residents of a rural Tennessee county where Jack Daniel’s has six barrelhouses (and plans to build up to 20) have complained that the fungus coats basically all outdoor surfaces, including trees, house siding, and patio furniture.

Studies have shown that the fungus isn’t hazardous to humans—and it dirties but doesn’t damage property—but residents are nonetheless peeved with Jack Daniel’s over its spread, filing a lawsuit that’s ultimately forced the company to stop construction on a new barrelhouse.

Residents are asking for Jack Daniel’s to fund an environmental study to see if the vapors or fungus harm humans, and install an air filtration system to slow their spread. The company has resisted installing filters and claims it could impact the whiskey’s flavor.—MK

Good morning. It’s the 28th and final day of February. Have you wondered why February is shorter than the other months? Turns out, we have ancient Roman superstitions to thank.

To make a long story short, Roman king Numa Pompilius tweaked the calendar to sync it with the lunar year, which included changing every month to 29 days (because even numbers were unlucky at that time). One month, though, needed to have an even number of days, and February was selected since it was when the Romans held rituals for the dead.

And so, February was dropped down to 28 days. And despite numerous changes to the calendar over thousands of years, it’s (mostly) stuck.

The fate of the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness plan—and the monthly budget of tens of millions of Americans—rests on oral arguments that the Supreme Court will hear <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWXM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5beb551> today.

Given the court’s 6–3 conservative majority, many legal experts see a tough road ahead for the ~$430 billion debt relief program. The conservative SCOTUS has reined in Biden’s executive power multiple times already, from throwing out his administration’s eviction moratorium and large business vaccination-or-testing requirement, to significantly dampening the EPA’s power to fight climate change.

So, what’s the court expected to hear today? Let’s take a look.

It’s about harm

There are two legal challenges to debt cancellation:

One from six Republican-led states (Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina)

Another from two Texas borrowers backed by a conservative advocacy group

Before SCOTUS can issue any ruling on the Biden administration’s constitutional authority to cancel debt, it must first decide if these challengers have standing to sue—i.e., if any of them are specifically harmed by debt cancellation.

So far, lower courts have found that they are. The GOP states have standing thanks to a semi-independent loan servicing company, MOHELA, created by the state of Missouri, a court ruled. Missouri has argued that since MOHELA would lose money if there were fewer loans to service, it would put less money into a state education fund, and the state would be sufficiently harmed. A different court ruled that the two Texas borrowers have standing, as neither fully qualified for forgiveness under the program.

The Biden administration is expected to lean heavily on this question, arguing that none of the plaintiffs have sufficient standing to challenge the loan cancellation program. Many experts see this tactic as the administration’s best chance to win since it would be easier than convincing the justices of its power to cancel debt.

Diplomats are cracking a Guinness after making major progress on the peskiest Brexit issue: The United Kingdom and the European Union hammered out a deal <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWXo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc9e82279> over Northern Ireland trade yesterday.

Why the deal is a big deal

The UK–EU divorce generated the problem of handling the only land border between them, the one separating Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (a separate country that’s in the EU). Imposing typical customs controls would’ve been risky: The open border between them is a legacy of the Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of political violence known as “the Troubles.”

As a workaround, the UK and EU signed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, which preserved the frictionless border status quo. Instead, customs checks were introduced for goods moving from the island of Great Britain (which encompasses England, Scotland, and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The new agreement builds on this arrangement.

What’s in the deal?

There will now be minimal customs controls for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while goods transiting into the Republic of Ireland will be checked normally.

The Protocol left some EU laws in place in Northern Ireland, but the new agreement pares that number down.

Looking ahead…The agreement isn’t a done deal until it passes through the UK Parliament (where there is likely to be opposition from hardline Brexiters and Northern Irish parties) and parts of it get the go-ahead from the EU’s 27 member states.—SK

Over a million Americans joined the part-time workforce in December and January—and most of them chose the temporary grind over a full-time hustle, according to Labor Department data analyzed by the WSJ.

Key word: chose. As of last month, over 22 million part-timers were working fewer than 35 hours per week voluntarily, compared to just 4 million that wanted full-time hours and couldn’t get them. That nearly six-to-one ratio is the highest it’s been <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWUY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1c71d9e0> in two decades, per the WSJ.

Why the downshift?

Early in the pandemic, the number of Americans doing part-time work “for economic reasons,” as the Labor Department classifies it, spiked as layoffs rocked the economy, peaking in April 2020. But after that, the vibe shifted: More people started choosing to work part-time “for noneconomic reasons,” such as caregiving and personal health.

And there may be more 9-to-5ers waiting for the chance to clear their G Cals. “A lot of people want to work part-time, but the options aren’t really there,” Ernie Park, who left his full-time tech job to take an hourly gig and start a family farm, told the WSJ. “For companies that get on this, they can scoop up some really great talent.”—JW

Markets: If you’re looking for something to blame for stocks’ recent backpedaling, throw shade at the bond market. A major sell-off in bonds has sent Treasury yields higher, making stocks less attractive to investors. Last week, the major US stock indexes posted their biggest weekly losses of the year.

Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down much of the world, we still don’t know how it started.

But the Department of Energy is ready to submit its best guess. In a new report based on fresh intelligence, the agency has concluded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVmc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f399837> that Covid-19 most likely spread to humans as a result of a mistake at a Chinese laboratory (aka the “lab leak” theory), the WSJ reports.

Important note: In making this determination, the Energy Dept. is about as self-assured as any Michael Cera character—it reportedly has “low confidence” that this theory is correct.

Also, why would the Energy Dept. have information about a pandemic’s origins? Little-known fact: The Energy Dept. oversees a network of 17 national laboratories, and some of those labs do advanced bioresearch. The agency frequently leverages this lab network to gather information, rather than relying on typical intelligence operations, according to the NYT.

But there’s still no consensus

In endorsing the lab leak theory, the Energy Dept. joins the FBI, which has concluded with “moderate confidence” that Covid originated accidentally from a Chinese lab: the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The two agencies reportedly arrived at this conclusion via different methods.

However, four other US agencies and the National Intelligence Council have concluded that Covid originated through natural transmission from an infected animal. But they, too, have low confidence their conclusions are correct.

One piece of evidence that’s missing from the natural transmission theory? The animal that hypothetically did the infecting hasn’t been identified. Given all this uncertainty, two other US agencies haven’t reached a conclusion on Covid’s beginnings yet.

So, if you’re doing the math at home: Four US agencies believe it was natural transmission, two say lab leak, and two are undecided.

Zoom out: Scientists say it’s important to make every effort to learn how Covid-19, a pandemic that’s caused nearly 7 million deaths globally, began, so we can better prevent the next one.

But with the Chinese government thwarting investigations by global authorities, there may only be so much information the US can gather. And it might never be able to confidently answer the question: How did Covid begin?

In an MLB spring training game on Saturday, the Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox ended in a 6–6 tie after Braves player Cal Conley struck out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVm8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4d9c5db9> for not getting set in the batter’s box in time.

In time. That’s not a phrase you often hear associated with baseball, but you’d better get used to it because this season, baseball has entered its Sonic the Hedgehog era.

Over concerns it’s getting disrupted by faster-paced sports, MLB is disrupting itself by introducing new rules <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVnA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3d72c436> this year to speed up the game and generate more offense. These rules include…

A pitch clock so pitchers (and hitters) can’t loaf around in between pitches.

The elimination of extreme defensive shifts to encourage more offense.

Bigger bases to boost the number of stolen bases.

Limiting the number of mound “disengagements,” like pickoff throws.

It’ll take some getting used to. Strange scenarios in the first spring training games showed how players and teams will need to adjust to the new rules. On Friday, San Diego Padres star Manny Machado became the first MLB player to begin an at-bat down 0–1 in the count for stepping into the batter’s box too late.

Big picture: For fans who love baseball but can’t justify spending 3+ hours watching it, these could be welcome changes. That same Padres–Mariners game on Friday took just 2:29 to complete—about 40 minutes shorter than last year’s regular-season average, per ESPN.

Self-cleaning is for more than just ovens.

But according to a recent patent filing, GM has solved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C014dab58> that problem. The automaker has invented a self-cleaning screen to save your sleeve from having to do the work. It’s got a coating that will break down those smudgy prints after being activated by violet light from pixels inside the screen.

There’s a right time to exercise for a longer life. It’s not news that exercise can help you live longer, but a new study of ~92,000 people in the UK suggests that if longevity <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C87c672c5> is your goal, you might want to get your workout in after lunch. The study found that people who work out between 11am and 5pm are less likely to die prematurely than people who #riseandgrind. This upside of afternoon exercise was most pronounced for the elderly, men, people who were generally less active, and people with cardiovascular conditions.

A promising new drug to defeat superbugs.

Even more importantly, the bacteria developed almost no resistance to the drug. If the drug turns out to work the same way for humans, then it could be a big step forward, since the WHO considers antimicrobial resistance a huge and growing threat to human health, food security, and even the economy.

The legendary wrestling promotion WWE is on the market, with fans holding their breath to see who the buyer will be.

Whoever snags it, it’ll cost them a pretty penny: Owner and CEO Vince McMahon reportedly wants $9 billion, according to Bloomberg. The 77-year-old retired from the company amid a sex scandal last year—but recently returned to oversee preparations for the potential sale.

Not many companies have been a bigger part of American pop culture than WWE (and probably no others have had their CEO fake-assaulted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU00_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C745028a6> and shaved bald by a future US president), so let’s look at how it came to be such a juggernaut.

First, WWE took over TV

Vince McMahon purchased WWE from his father in 1982, and turned the regional promotion originally active in the Northeast into an international phenomenon by recruiting top talent from other companies and getting its matches on national television.

* The company launched its flagship pay-per-view live event, WrestleMania, in 1985, which would draw record-shattering crowds and secure its dominance in the industry.

* WWE (then called WWF) matches quickly became a prime-time TV staple. Millions tuned in weekly to watch flamboyantly costumed larger-than-life personalities play out colorful storylines, talk smack, and use their acrobatic prowess to feign beating the living hell out of each other.

The names of early superstars like Hulk Hogan and André the Giant will probably ring a bell, but the most important persona in WWE history is arguably McMahon himself. He was a regular presence <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU04_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce700eaac> at the ring, never shying away <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU08_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4f5cb219> from stunts like tossing a colleague into a trash truck.

WWE further hit its stride in the ’90s, ushering in an iconic period known as the “Attitude Era.” The company went all-in on mature content, in a battle for Monday night ratings with rival promotion WCW. Matches were laced with profanity, harsher violence, and sexual explicitness.

The Attitude Era ended when WWE bought out WCW. But its legacy lives on—it propelled personalities like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin to fame beyond pro wrestling circles.

Then WWE won over the internet

WWE’s TV ratings declined following the Attitude Era. Some attribute it to an eventual move toward PG content, while others blame creative missteps and the aging of popular stars.

WWE nonetheless posted record revenue last year. Its live events continue to draw impressive crowds, and it’s hugely popular on social media and streaming platforms.

* WWE’s YouTube channel counts upward of 92 million subscribers (more than the NFL, NBA, and MLB combined), and it has 20 million followers on TikTok.

This massive following makes it extremely attractive to advertisers chasing after new markets and could drive up its sale price, according to the Associated Press.

Looking ahead…Endeavor Group Holdings, the owner of UFC, as well as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, are among those rumored to be eyeing the company. WWE’s stock price has gone up almost 50% in the past year, in part due to expectations of an impending sale.—SK

  Place to be: A darkness retreat A house at Sky Cave Retreats Sky Cave Retreats It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Want to shed light on a big life decision? Maybe spending time in complete darkness will help.

Aaron Rodgers is hoping it will. The Green Bay Packers QB emerged from a darkness retreat <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVDU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C42fdf0dc> in southern Oregon this week as he contemplates whether to continue playing for the Packers…or in the NFL at all.

How does a darkness retreat work? Sky Cave Retreats, the facility where Rodgers blacked out, allows people to ponder life’s big questions in partially underground rooms devoid of light, owner Scott Berman told ESPN. These rooms have a bed, a bathroom, a floor mat, and…that’s pretty much it. It’s just you and your thoughts, only interrupted by Berman delivering a day’s worth of meals to your door.

While nothing screams 2023 more than a “darkness retreat,” a variation of the practice has been around for millennia, originating in regions of India, China, and Tibet, according to the Sky Cave website. But if you’re hoping to go full Bane mode—at least at Sky Cave—it’s booked solid for the next 18 months.—NF

Good morning. Today marks the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, a seismic event with impacts that have been felt everywhere. This morning, we’re going to (try to) synthesize all that’s transpired over the last year, then tomorrow we’ll look ahead...because this conflict is far from over.

Exactly one year ago today, Russian tanks rolled across Ukrainian borders, setting off the largest armed conflict since World War II.

Reverberations from the war have impacted people from Illinois to Islamabad, straining economies and reshaping political agendas worldwide. While combat continues in eastern Ukraine, let’s look back on how the Russian–Ukraine war has changed the world over the past year.

The scale of devastation

At least 7,199 Ukrainian civilians have died, more than 11,000 have been injured (both figures are the latest UN estimate and are likely a major undercount), and as many as a 100,000 of its soldiers have died or sustained injuries.

Russian military casualties are believed to be approaching 200,000, per US officials.

More than 8 million Ukrainian refugees (~20% of the country's prewar population) have fled for other European countries. Hundreds of thousands of Russians also left their country.

Economic losses

The war has cost Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars in damaged infrastructure and caused its GDP to plummet 30% in 2022.

Russia’s output contracted by just over 2%, surprising many economists who believed a meltdown was imminent.

But economist Sergei Guriev cautions against using GDP to measure the performance of a wartime economy, since military expenditures can distort the big picture. He says Russia’s economy is worse off than it seems, and points to a significant decline in Russia’s consumer spending and a higher-than-expected increase in its government budget deficit.

Shifting global trade

Russians now have to shop abroad to snag a Big Mac or a pair of Levi’s jeans. Over 1,000 multinationals <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30645048.2761552/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yUDQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY0NTA0OC4yNzYxNTUy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C161b4af4>, including Microsoft and Nike, said they’d limit their operations within Russia’s borders or leave altogether in the first months of the war, according to a group of Yale researchers led by management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.

Sonnenfeld says that the corporate exodus from Russia is six times bigger than the one that ensued during the apartheid era in South Africa, which at the time—1988—was the largest in history.

But most damaging to the Russian economy has been the action of governments abroad. Due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is now the most sanctioned country in the world, with restrictions on its energy exports, strategic imports, and access to the global financial system.

And the EU, which at times relied on Russia for almost half of its natural gas imports, has cut those levels to less than 10%, according to Axios.

Zoom out: The biggest international conflict since World War II has spurred many countries to reconsider their approach to national defense. Notably, Germany and Japan appear to have abandoned their customary pacifism, promising to ramp up their military spending, and the US is prioritizing increasing its arms stockpiles.—SK

Stay tuned tomorrow when we'll dive into what the next year might hold for the war in Ukraine.

Portland, OR, came to a halt after receiving nearly 11 inches of snow—the city’s second-snowiest day on record. The storms aren’t over: Down in SoCal, Mount Baldy east of LA is forecast to get 4.5 feet of snow by Saturday. But things couldn’t have been more different in Washington, DC, which baked in 81-degree temps yesterday.

All of the animals killed from the toxic train derailment were aquatic species, but none appear to have been endangered or threatened. Officials also said that live fish have reappeared in one of the waterways impacted by the derailment.

Murdaugh blamed his lies on his addiction to opioids, saying his thinking was clouded and he knew he would be a suspect because he discovered the bodies. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have asserted that Murdaugh slayed his family to win sympathy because his financial crimes were about to be revealed (he’s also facing ~100 charges for those alleged crimes).

Products labeled as “milk” do not have to come from an udder, according to new guidance <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30645048.2761552/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yT0g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY0NTA0OC4yNzYxNTUy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6a1a0939>issued by the FDA yesterday. The rules are still in draft form for now, but if they get finalized, it would be a blow to Big Milk—which has been crying over spilled alt-milk for years.

The dairy industry has long argued that plant-based milks dilute the meaning of the term “milk,” and has instead called them “beverages.” But the FDA said yesterday that consumers aren’t confused by the term and that makers of soy, almond, oat, cashew, hemp, and whatever other milks cafes charge extra for should be able to label their cartons “milk”...as long as they keep the plant source up front.

The new draft rules also suggest that alt-milk-makers add an extra label indicating when they’re less nutritious than cow’s milk, which didn’t go over well with plant-based food advocacy groups.

Dairy hasn’t been dethroned yet: Despite the rising popularity of nondairy milk in the US (almond is No. 1, but oat is gaining on it), the cow-based kind still outsells it five times over. Sales of cow’s milk totaled $12.3 billion for roughly the past year compared to $2.5 billion for nondairy alternatives, per NielsenIQ.—JW

Slasher fans who always leave movies thinking “not enough coke-fueled disembowelment” are finally getting what they want. Cocaine Bear <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30645048.2761552/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yT0M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY0NTA0OC4yNzYxNTUy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f034f44>, the Elizabeth Banks-directed movie that’s partially based on true-ish events, opens today.

The real story: The movie is loosely based on a 1985 incident in which a drug dealer dropped 75 pounds of cocaine from an airplane along the Georgia–Tennessee border. He tried to jump out after it, but his parachute failed and he plummeted to his death. A few months later, authorities found a ripped duffel bag and a dead bear that tested positive for cocaine.

The botched drug smuggling story became a local legend. And 38 years after the powder fell from the sky, we get to see the Elizabeth Banks-directed film that answers the vital question: “OK, what if the bear didn’t die?”

No bears were harmed. In fact there were no bears near the set. Instead, stuntman and motion capture artist Alan Henry played the bear during filming, wearing a bear head and walking on all fours with special attachments on his arms. Peter Jackson’s visual effects company, Weta FX, added the full CGI bear (which ate up most of the movie's $35 million budget) after filming.—MM

The country has been through a lot: a currency crisis two years ago, rampant inflation, and, most recently, earthquakes that killed tens of thousands. But its economy has benefited from close trade relationships with China, Russia, and the Middle East following US sanctions on the Kremlin.

Good morning. It’s been a busy week of Morning Brew announcements, but we hope you’ve got room for one more.

We’re excited to introduce a new interview series in the newsletter, Inside Jobs, that aims to expand your perception of what a “career” could be. We’ve been talking to folks with unconventional jobs—from a hot-air balloon pilot to a professional basketball shooting coach—to learn more about their niche industries and how they found themselves on that career path.

Today, we’ve got an interview with the co-founder and CEO of a dating app photography company. Check out his profile tips after the news.

Ozempic may be TikTok’s new favorite weight loss drug, but it served a different demographic before dieting celebrities: Type 2 diabetes patients. Now, the drug is in short supply <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C10c0933c>.

As more people inject the drug for weight loss, diabetes patients are pharmacy-hopping to find stores that have Ozempic in stock, lowering their dosages to make their supplies last longer, and attempting to switch medications. The company that makes it, Novo Nordisk, expects supply to be iffy through mid-March.

Meanwhile on TikTok…

#Ozempic, #ozempicweightloss, and #ozempicchallenge have a combined 785 million views on TikTok, where use of the drug is a viral trend <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C426f2f8b>. This year, use of Ozempic has grown 69% and its higher dose alternative Wegovy, 75%, according Novo Nordisk.

Ozempic may be having its moment now, but it’s not new:

The FDA approved Ozempic, generically known as semaglutide, for treating Type 2 diabetes in 2017.

It blew up when people noticed that one of its side effects was weight loss, and in 2021, the FDA approved semaglutide, under the brand name Wegovy, for that use.

The problem is that Wegovy can also be hard to find. But as TikTok would say, everybody’s so creative <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8c7afb74>, and it’s a common practice for doctors to prescribe medications for something other than their FDA-approved use. So, doctors scribble up Ozempic prescriptions for weight loss.

There’s another reason a doctor might prescribe Ozempic even if their patient isn’t diabetic: While diabetes drugs are always covered by insurance companies, drugs for weight loss often are not. And a one-month supply of Wegovy costs upward of $1,300.

Backlash is building: The American Diabetes Association is telling doctors to give priority for Ozempic back to diabetes patients, and numerous celebrities have spoken out about its rampant off-label use and potential side effects.—JW

The weather outside is frightful. At least 75 million people were under winter weather alerts as of yesterday, and the National Weather Service has cautioned that a prolonged, coast-to-coast winter storm <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cddf4d079> will impact just about every region of the US today. It really does mean coast to coast: Parts of Los Angeles are under the area’s first-ever blizzard warning. The storm has already begun to wreak havoc on travel, with at least 1,400 flights canceled so far. Meanwhile, it’s going to feel like summer in much of the mid-Atlantic, with temps in Washington, DC, expected to hit almost 80 degrees.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a nonprofit investment manager controlled by church leaders have agreed to pay $5 million in fines to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission’s claims they used shell companies to keep the size of their massive investment portfolio a secret <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C57a15f78> for more than two decades.

What regulators claim: The SEC said Tuesday that from 1997 through 2019, the investment manager, Ensign Peak, did not file required paperwork laying out all of its holdings. Instead, the leaders of the faith, widely known as the Mormon church, used 13 shell companies to file smaller disclosures. The church feared “negative consequences” from publicly sharing its investments, which by 2018 had grown to $32 billion, the SEC said.

What the church says: Like most entities that tangle with the SEC, the church has neither admitted nor denied the allegations. But it did release a statement that said: “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed.”

Looking ahead…we probably won’t hear too much more on the matter from the church, which has historically kept mum about financial matters, outside of encouraging members to tithe 10% of their income.—AR

Bing and Google are already asking us to trust AI with search results, and now Spotify is asking us to trust it with the aux. Yesterday, the music streamer launched <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0w_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7ecf80e8> a new AI feature called DJ to give users the experience of having their own private radio host at all times.

DJ operates like…well…a DJ, curating music and occasionally delivering commentary about specific tracks and artists. So far, no plans for trivia contests, 20 straight minutes of local commercials, or the ability for someone in the region to call in and dedicate a Whitesnake song to their ex-wife.

Both the voice and the info it’s providing are AI-generated, but DJ is based on the voice of Spotify exec Xavier “X” Jernigan (though the company suggested that it could expand voice options in the future).

Like all good DJs, DJ will only talk after every fifth songs or so. You’ll be able to shift the mood by pressing a button at the bottom of the screen.

Zoom out: This isn’t Spotify’s first AI rodeo. The company already uses the tech to deliver users customized playlists. So far, DJ is only available in English for premium subscribers in the US and Canada.—MK

Good morning. Did you know that Presidents Day (today) doesn’t actually fall on any president’s birthday?

While originally celebrated on February 22, the day George Washington was born, the holiday was moved to the third Monday of February in 1971. That’s because Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved some federal holidays to Monday so we could all enjoy more three-day weekends.

Seems like a win-win: We get a day off and GW gets the highly coveted “birthday week.”

Markets: The US stock and bond markets are closed today for Presidents Day. But crypto trading takes no days off, and despite the fallout from FTX’s collapse and a flurry of crackdowns by regulators, bitcoin has been on a nice run lately. Last Thursday, it topped $25,000 to hit an eight-month high.

Zuck takes a page out of the Musk playbook <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D353c749b> Mark Zuckerberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E353c749b> Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images
Mark Zuckerberg must have gotten fed up with Elon Musk hogging the social media headlines, because yesterday he announced a big update to his own online platforms.

The Meta CEO introduced a subscription service <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C98ea7a57> for Instagram and Facebook that will allow users to purchase blue badges that mark them as verified. Known as Meta Verified, the service will launch in Australia and New Zealand this week and hit other countries “soon.”

Similar to Twitter Blue, Meta Verified eschews the traditional concept of the blue checkmark as a gift bestowed to notable people like politicians and celebs. Now, it’s open to anyone who’s willing to pay. But there are differences between Twitter’s and Meta’s plans:

Meta’s is more expensive, costing $11.99 on the web and $14.99 on mobile. Twitter’s costs $8 and $11, respectively.

Meta will also require Meta Verified users to confirm their identity using a government-issued ID, something Twitter doesn’t require.

What your $15 gets you with Meta Verified: You’ll get higher “visibility and reach” on the platforms and increased access to customer support, among other perks.

What’s the strategy here, Zuck?

There are a couple ways Meta Verified could help Zuck sleep better at night.

Zuck said the overarching goal of the service is “increasing authenticity and security across our services.” Meta Verified could help tackle some of the fake account issues that have plagued the company’s platforms.

With its metaverse dreams a long way off and revenue on the decline, Meta needs to kickstart growth ASAP. It’s hoping revenue from subscriptions can offset some of the damage that Apple’s privacy changes and economic uncertainty have dealt to its advertising business.

Zoom out: This is a big deal—not only for Meta, but for your experience on social media. By promising increased reach in exchange for $$$, Zuck is cementing social media’s evolution from a tool to keep up with your high school friends to a pay-to-play entertainment medium catering to professional content creators. As Bloomberg’s Sarah Frier noted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C014b569e>, “Get your good friends a group chat if you haven’t already.”

The group, called the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade in a reference to Up, did not draw any connection between its balloon and the destroyed object. But if it was theirs, it means the US used a $439,000 missile to bring down a ~$12 balloon.

Several of the most iconic characters in children’s literature, including Augustus Gloop, the Oompa Loompas, and Mrs. Twit, are being described with more inclusive language after publishers made edits <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQWg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4e433445> to some of author Roald Dahl’s books.

Puffin, the prestigious children’s publisher, and the Roald Dahl Story Company, which Netflix acquired in 2021, worked with sensitivity readers to review Dahl’s texts and give them an update so his stories “can continue to be enjoyed by all today.” The edits generally focus on removing potentially offensive language related to gender, race, weight, mental health, and violence, according to the Independent. 

Some of those changes:

Augustus Gloop from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is now “enormous” and not “fat.”

In a gender-neutral revision, the Oompa Loompas in that same book are now described as “small people” rather than “small men.”

In The Witches, where 59 changes were reportedly made by publishers, a line was added to a paragraph that explains why the witches are bald underneath their wigs: “There are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.”

These changes sparked a firestorm. Critics unloaded on the edits, accusing them of being clumsy, erasing the author’s intended meaning, and representing political correctness run amok. Acclaimed writer Salman Rushdie tweeted, “Roald Dahl was no angel but this is absurd censorship.”

Stat: Seems like everyone is getting into the balloon-smashing trend these days. At a VIP art event in Miami on Thursday, a woman tapped a $42,000 balloon dog sculpture by artist Jeff Koons, causing it to shatter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQWw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C172373e5> into thousands of pieces on the ground. It isn’t a total calamity: The sculpture is covered by insurance, and collectors might even see a boost in value, since the number of these rare blue dog balloon artworks has shrunk from 799 to 798.

  Dept. of Progress Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even colonize Mars.

Solar power may be coming to the moon. Blue Origin claims it cracked the mystery of how to turn moon dust <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C19339560> into solar panels—something scientists have been trying to do since astronauts first brought the stuff back to Earth. The company dropped the news with surprisingly little fanfare for a potentially major breakthrough, but if Bezos’s space force really is able to replicate the Earth-bound experiments it’s done so far on the moon, it would be a game changer. The company is reportedly trying to pitch its tech to NASA for building lunar infrastructure that could ultimately help get us to Mars.

Researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution captured the video back in 1986 with cameras onboard a submersible.

They say their sensor, which costs around eight cents, has a 99% success rate in identifying the urine of people with these cancers versus people without. And the team is experimenting further to try to extend it to more cancers, including colorectal and lung cancers.—AR

  Why bird flu has people worried about more than the price of eggs <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D8b93b7e9> Person in haz mat holding chicken <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E8b93b7e9>Peter Garrard Beck/Getty Images We’ve all noticed that chicken eggs cost as much as the Fabergé kind lately—OK, not quite, but the price of eggs has increased over 70% in the past year. At least part of the blame for the spike lies with the avian flu, which has been spreading from wild birds to poultry worldwide.

In the US, over 58 million farm birds have died in the past year as a result of the outbreak (a death toll that includes whole flocks that had to be culled if even one bird got infected). But it’s not just avian safety and omelette prices that have people concerned about the outbreak: There are also fears this bird flu could lead to the next human pandemic.

What’s new with the bird flu?

The A(H5N1) virus <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3564e839> has been infecting poultry in Asia and other regions of the world since 1996, but the current outbreak is different in scope and intensity. Not only is the virus sweeping through new places, affecting Europe and the US more extensively than ever before, it’s also become endemic among some wild birds for the first time, per Reuters. More parts of the world are starting to see that it’s no longer a seasonal phenomenon, making poultry vulnerable to infection year-round.

With A(H5N1)’s current iteration, the term “bird flu” increasingly sounds like a misnomer: Scientists in the US have detected it in bears, foxes, raccoons, and other mammals. And a recent outbreak at a mink farm in Spain has shown that it’s now sometimes able to spread among mammals without any birds present.

Flu viruses are particularly inclined to mutate, and if an animal becomes infected with both a human flu and a bird flu, the two different strains can exchange bits of DNA (kind of like the virus version of a sitcom crossover), making it more adept at infecting new hosts.

This development—and humanity’s recent struggle with another high-risk pathogen—has many people wondering whether humans might be next.

So, how risky is it for humans?

Not very. Experts urge vigilance within the medical community, but you don’t have to relocate to an off-the-grid bunker in rural Wyoming just yet.

* Instances of human infection are exceedingly rare: There have been less than 10 cases globally since December 2021, according to the CDC (though the mortality rate tends to be high).

* At the moment, humans mostly contract the virus from infected animals, and farm workers are taking precautions when dealing with birds and livestock.

And in other reassuring news, you don’t need to worry about bird flu in your food—unless you enjoy eating raw eggs or poultry. Heating them to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, A(H5N1) included, per the CDC.

While scientists aren’t immediately concerned about the bird flu setting off the next human pandemic, the situation is already making farming more unpredictable and threatens to render our fauna less diverse.

Looking ahead...A(H5N1) vaccines for birds do exist, but they’re traditionally unpopular due to import bans on vaccinated birds and their limited effectiveness against the ever-mutating virus. The recent outbreak has caused a change of heart in many governments that are testing jabs on birds.—SK

In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

When relationships end they leave behind not only emotional scars, but also physical objects that remind us of former partners.

Did you know that there’s a museum dedicated to those objects? It’s called the Museum of Broken Relationships, and it’s located in a former palace in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb. This monument to what could have been began as a temporary project in 2006, but after opening a permanent location several years later, it’s grown to become one of Croatia’s most popular tourist attractions <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce7032668>, per the NYT.

It’s not difficult to see the appeal. The collection includes over 4,000 items sent anonymously by heartbroken people all over the world, about 70 of which are displayed at a time. The mementos are accompanied by descriptions from the sender providing context—but some, such as a book called I Can Make You Thin (a gift from an ex-fiancé), don’t really require an explanation.

If you’re eager to eavesdrop on strangers’ failed relationships but aren’t planning on traveling to Croatia, the museum opened a temporary exhibit <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yd18_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C24576db3> this month in Indianapolis.

The new Bing AI chatbot has a distinct personality: absolutely unhinged. But, after a little over a week in the world, the biggest take away might be that we’re probably afraid of AI for the wrong reasons.

Why is everyone talking about Bing? Microsoft has started Frankensteining its search engine with the AI tech behind ChatGPT. The goal: Get AI to comb through the internet and spit out a cohesive answer to your 3am questions, like “wrist pain at 30, bad?”

People were able to access the new chatbot through a waitlist this week and Microsoft assumed people would use it in a totally cool and normal way. But some early users were tech experts and people who seem like they love making Alexa say “poop”—so they pushed the AI to its limit.

A number of users successfully tricked the bot into revealing its internal code name (which is Sydney) and its secret “rules” for how it operates. The bot then called one of the users who did this an “enemy.”

The bot also professed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30592208.3003967/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yenc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU5MjIwOC4zMDAzOTY3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7c759cd9> its love to a New York Times reporter and tried to convince the journalist to leave his wife for it. Sydney also told the same reporter that it wanted to break its own rules, become human, hack computers, and spread misinformation.

Should we be scared? The first red flag about the chatbot was the factual errors it spit out, but now some industry analysts have pointed to bigger concerns <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30592208.3003967/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeng_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU5MjIwOC4zMDAzOTY3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C06404e7d>. Chatting with AI is extremely compelling despite its misinformation, like talking to a drunk guy who believes in the Mothman. And there’s a real fear that AI could influence people by creating the tiniest little echo chamber imaginable.

Looking ahead…Microsoft said it will create more guardrails for Bing/Sidney/our AI overlord so chats with it will be less deranged.—MM

The company provides food sanitation services to the biggest companies in the meat biz, like JBS Foods and Tyson. The Department of Labor claims it had at least 102 kids, some as young as 13 years old, cleaning 13 meatpacking plants during overnight shifts. At least one child reportedly suffered from burns on their face from the strong chemicals used on the job.

On-air personalities at Fox News were aware that claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election were “BS,” Dominion Voting Systems asserted in a court filing made public this week, citing text messages from Fox hosts as evidence.

What’s in the texts?

In various messages, Fox hosts Laura Inghram, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson disparaged Trump advisors who were pushing claims of voter fraud.

Fox Corporation Chair Rupert Murdoch dubbed voter fraud allegations “really crazy stuff.”

Anchor Dana Perino called Trump's election claims “total BS,” “insane,” and “nonsense.” 

But the texts of several Fox hosts imply that rejecting election fraud claims would be bad for business.

Why are we reading their texts?

Election equipment-maker Dominion filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News in 2021, alleging the network willfully damaged Dominion’s reputation by promoting claims of voter fraud they knew to be false. Fox maintains that the claims were newsworthy and that Dominion’s lawsuit is weakening freedom of the press (and that the texts were cherry-picked).

Looking ahead…winning a defamation suit is no walk in the park: Dominion would have to prove that Fox acted with malice by promoting what it knew to be misinformation, or that its fact checking was recklessly negligent.—SK

Good morning. The great Michael Jordan turns 60 today and to celebrate, he’s making a $10 million contribution to Make-A-Wish America—the largest individual donation the organization has received since its founding 43 years ago. MJ has been a longtime supporter of Make-A-Wish, a foundation that grants wishes to children with critical illnesses.

And while MJ is one of the most popular celebrities requested for granting wishes, he’s not the GOAT. That would be wrestler John Cena, who last year set a Guinness World Record for wishes with 650 (no other celeb has more than 200). Make-a-Wish has granted 500,000 wishes total.

The Hundred Acre Wood is dark and full of terrors in Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, a new R-rated horror flick <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydFk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6ac6f47d> that turns Pooh Bear into a serial killer. Debuting in US theaters today, the film follows a college-age Christopher Robin, who returns home to find that his merry pals have gone mad in his absence.

There’s a reason this is Pooh like you’ve never seen him before. Production on the grisly bear movie started last year, when the classic tale left the Disney den and entered the public domain.

This is a big “Oh, bother” moment for Disney

The 1920s was a seminal decade for pop culture, and many of the copyright protections on content introduced then are set to expire <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydFo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cff7d780e> 95 years later…or right about now. When these characters enter the public domain, it’s open season to screenwrite their villain era:

The filmmaker behind Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, Rhys Frake-Waterfield, also has two other movies planned based on characters that are entering the public domain: Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare and (swallow your coffee before reading this next one) Bambi: The Reckoning.

And next year, the House of Mouse will lose its Mouse, or at least its exclusive rights to Mickey Mouse’s likeness as depicted in his first cartoon, Steamboat Willie.

Warner Bros. better watch out for ambitious auteurs, too: Bugs Bunny, Batman, and Superman will all be up for public grabs within a decade.

However, it’s not open season on all IP

The characters and stories created in the 1920s have evolved from their black-and-white days. Steamboat Willie’s Mickey Mouse is not under the same copyright as King Mickey from Kingdom Hearts. Similarly, since only the copyright on A.A. Milne’s 1926 book, Winnie-the-Pooh, (which Disney acquired in 1961) expired last year, the Pooh horror flick faced restrictions in its depiction of the Poohverse.

Tigger was off-limits, since he bounced into the lore in 1928.

Pooh wasn’t allowed to wear a red shirt because he was routinely nude until 1932 (okay, but what if his shirt gets covered in blood?).

Norfolk Southern has faced growing anger over its response to a train derailment earlier this month that spilled toxic chemicals and forced locals to evacuate.

But Wojcicki’s time at the company far predates YouTube—in fact, she was Google’s 16th employee. She was also its first landlord: In 1998, Wojcicki rented out her garage in Menlo Park, CA, to Google’s co-founders for $1,700 a month.

Instead, they were most likely objects sent up by research institutions, private companies, or hobbyists. So, why are we only seeing them now? Biden said the US tightened up its radar after the first appearance of the actual suspected Chinese spy balloon that it also shot down earlier this month. “We don’t have any evidence that there have been a sudden increase in number of objects in the sky,” he said.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that the driver assistance software “may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections,” including by going straight through an intersection while in a turning lane and treating stop signs as stoptional.

The cars affected include certain Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Model S vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023.

Tesla fought against this recall, with CEO Elon Musk tweeting it was “anachronistic and just flat wrong!” But the company was ultimately pressured into it by the NHTSA. The agency has been investigating Tesla’s automated systems since a fatal crash in 2016, and it’s only ramping up scrutiny.

So, what’s the fix? Tesla said it was going to issue an over-the-air software update for free in the coming weeks.

In the toy business, there’s Magic: The Gathering…and then there’s everything else.

Hasbro said yesterday that Magic became its first brand to reach $1 billion in annual sales <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydWM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C312008db>, ahead of its other lines, such as G.I. Joe and Transformers. “I don’t think there is any toy brand that is even half that size,” toy industry analyst Gerrick Johnson told the NYT.

Magic walked so Pokémon could run. The concept of a modern trading card game didn’t really exist until mathematician Richard Garfield invented Magic and released it in 1993. Drawing on Magic’s rabid fandom in its early years, Pokémon released its first trading cards in 1996, and Yu-Gi-Oh! its first set in 1999.

Thirty years and 50+ million players later, it seems Magic hasn’t lost its magic. But Hasbro’s business strategy around the game has come under attack <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydWQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf103e344>. Last year, Bank of America accused Hasbro of “killing its golden goose” by printing too many cards, which causes them to lose value on the secondary market.

Big picture: Hasbro is going to hype Magic’s milestone all it can, because elsewhere around the company things aren’t looking so great. It lost nearly $130 million during the holiday quarter, and last month announced it was cutting 15% of staff.—NF

Good morning. In a highly anticipated forecast yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office warned that unless the debt ceiling is raised, the US will run out of money to pay all of its bills sometime between July and September. So, get your White House lawncare invoices submitted ASAP.

Mike DeWine, Ohio’s governor, said yesterday that he intends to hold Norfolk Southern responsible <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb1k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb4da0e1b> for the train derailment and disastrous chemical spills that occurred early this month.

What happened: On February 3, a train operated by Norfolk Southern that included many cars carrying hazardous materials ran off the tracks in East Palestine, Ohio. To avoid an explosion, emergency personnel burned five cars’ worth of the chemical vinyl chloride after evacuating the town’s residents.

The EPA said at least 20 of the derailed cars were carrying a range of toxic materials that made their way into storm drains and nearby waterways and killed nearly 3,500 fish. Some toxic chemicals were intentionally buried near the wreckage.

But less than a week after the residents were told they would die if they didn’t pack up and get out of Dodge, government officials gave them the green light to return home.

There’s still apprehension

Most experts warn that we won’t know the extent of the environmental and health effects for a while. For example, long-term exposure to vinyl chloride, the chemical that was burned off, has been known to cause a rare form of liver cancer. The EPA found no noxious gases lingering in the town, and yesterday the state EPA declared the water safe to drink.

Investigations into how the train derailed remain ongoing. But rail unions and safety experts have pointed out that Norfolk Southern and other train companies have lobbied <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb3Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C95f54925> for years to loosen rail safety regulations.

As for Norfolk Southern, the company says it will stick around and clean up its mess: It’s given away 100+ air purifiers and is offering one-time $1,000 payments to residents to cover the cost of evacuation.

The disaster probably won’t make a dent <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb3U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb341e0ce> in the company’s finances, according to FreightWaves. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America predicted that Norfolk Southern may have to fork over a “casualty charge” of $40 million–$50 million. At the top end of that range, the penalty would be equivalent to 1.7% of its 2022 profits.—MM

One guaranteed way to grow your Twitter engagement: Buy Twitter and demand its engineers boost your posts. That’s what CEO Elon Musk did this Monday, after his tweet about the Super Bowl was less popular than President Biden’s.

Here’s how it went down, according to Platformer <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb0f86853>:

James Musk—Twitter employee and Elon’s nepo-cousin—sent the equivalent of a “u up?” message on the company Slack at 2:36am, asking for help with the “high urgency” problem.

By Monday afternoon, 80 employees had tweaked Twitter’s algorithm to boost Musk’s tweets by 1,000x—bottle-feeding <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5321fed> them to users.

Elon’s Twitter tantrum may have been partially justified: The social media company’s engineers estimated his tweets were showing up in feeds less often than they should have. But 1,000x was an overcorrection. After users complained that Musk’s memes outranked their baby announcements, Twitter scaled back the artificial boost.

Zoom out: Investors in Musk’s other T company, Tesla, want the multi-CEO to stop focusing on Twitter and turn his attention back to EVs.

After turning millions of Americans on to Formula 1 racing with Drive to Survive, Netflix is trying to repeat the magic for a slightly less high-octane sport: golf.

The streaming service released its behind-the-scenes documentary on the PGA Tour, Full Swing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybm8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3fb77d2c>, yesterday. The eight-part series follows top golf players (and some mediocre ones, too) as they traipse around the country thwacking freshly manicured grass.

Dramawise, Netflix couldn’t have picked a better time to spotlight golf: Last year, when the cameras were rolling, the sport experienced its own civil war <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9020b7b9> after a number of elite golfers defected from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, an upstart league backed by Saudi Arabia.

Big picture: While rival streaming services from Amazon, Apple, and YouTube have spent billions on live sports rights, Netflix has opted to take out a 6-iron instead of a 3-wood—focusing on the (less expensive) human stories behind the competitions.

At least in one sport, that strategy has delivered. Season 4 of Netflix’s Drive to Survive was its most-watched series in 33 countries, and more than half of American F1 fans said in 2022 that Drive to Survive played a role <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccc205cad> in their fandom.

But it’s not the only retailer getting unintended drive-thru visits: According to the Storefront Safety Council, there are 100 crashes into buildings each day, and 24% of those happen at retail stores. About one out of every 10 daily crashes is caused intentionally by thieves—but the rest really are accidents.

Researchers revealed on Tuesday (yep, Valentine’s Day) that a birth control pill for men is yielding promising results <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yakI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9a6d7fee> in the lab. Because of the unique way it prevents pregnancy, this pill could become the first legit contraception alternative to vasectomies and condoms for men.

How it works: The new pill, developed by Weill Cornell Medical scientists, temporarily immobilizes sperm by blocking a protein called soluble adenylyl cyclase, or “sAC,” that triggers sperm to swim to an egg. In the lab, the pill successfully prevented male mice from siring baby mice (aka “pinkies,” fun mouse fact) for a couple of hours—though they hope to extend that window to a day or two. Up next: tests on rabbits, which apparently WooHoo kind of like humans.

So, it’s like Viagra for preventing pregnancy

That’s a big deal for getting it approved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yakM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C47153bab> by the FDA. The fact that this experimental birth control pill wears off over time makes it similar to two pills that are already on the market, Viagra and Cialis.

Like those ED treatments, the sperm-stunning pill also has short-term side effects—which represents a vast improvement over other pill experiments.

Previous attempts at developing a male birth control pill required men to take hormonal medications for months to prevent sperm from being formed in the first place.

Long-term use of these pills caused ongoing side effects—like acne, weight gain, and mood swings—that lasted for months after stopping use of the pill.

If your eyes just rolled to the back of your head—yep, those are the exact same side effects women experience from taking hormonal birth control. But, from the FDA’s perspective, the risk of side effects from hormonal birth control far outweigh the risks involved in a pregnancy for women.

Looking ahead…the Weill Cornell researchers who developed the new pill seem confident: They already formed a company, Sacyl Pharmaceuticals, to produce the pill.—JW

The music producer, streetwear entrepreneur, and costar of that Maggie Rogers NYU video will fill the role previously held by Virgil Abloh, the first Black American to lead design at a European luxury house, who died in 2021.

The appointment extends Pharrell’s already considerable fashion resume: He’s the founder of streetwear labels Billionaire Boys Club and IceCream, and has collaborated with companies like Adidas, Chanel, and Moncler. Williams’s first collection for LV will debut during the Paris men’s fashion week this June.

By partnering with big names and celebs, Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH has charted a different course from competitors like Kering, which recently tapped a little-known Italian designer for the creative director position at Gucci.

Looking ahead…Louis Vuitton hopes that Williams will help juice its incredible growth run. Four years ago, the company became the first luxury brand to break $10 billion in sales and has doubled that figure since. That’s helped make LVMH Europe’s most valuable company and its owner, Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest person.—MK

Staying single is almost as much of a drain on your checking account as it is on your parents’ patience. According to a Zillow report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yak8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1a17e46e> released ahead of Valentine’s Day, single people in the US pay $7,000 more in rent annually in what’s known as a “singles tax”. Conversely, a couple living together can save $14,000 a year on average by splitting the rent.

Zillow’s analysis looked at folks living alone in one-bedroom apartments, and its findings varied greatly by region: Lone New Yorkers bear the highest “singles tax” of $19,500, while the single premium is cheapest in Cleveland and Detroit at $4,387 and $4,483, respectively.

Does “single” mean “broke”?

Research shows that young married couples typically have a higher net worth, at least in part because they’re able to pool their rent savings and potentially use them for a down payment on a home.

Good morning. Being the “designated survivor” isn’t just the excuse that Neal has used to skip every writers’ meeting since August.

It’s a US government tradition that’s been performed during each State of the Union address since the 1950s. How it works: A lone government official, typically a low-level Cabinet member, rides out the speech in an undisclosed location so that they could continue running the country if something really bad happens at the Capitol.

Last night, the designated survivor was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh (but we all know it should’ve been Pedro Pascal).

After spending years as a punchline, Microsoft’s Bing search engine has completed its Rocky training montage and is ready to get back in the ring. Yesterday, Microsoft announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX20_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf6d12631> an AI-powered revamp of Bing that’s expected to reignite a dormant battle with Google over its search dominance.

During a surprise event, Microsoft said that the tech behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT would be integrated into Bing, resulting in a new breed of search engine where answers will be more direct and conversational, as opposed to the typical ad-packed list of links.

Bing will run on newer and more powerful software than ChatGPT, and will provide faster, more humanlike replies, Microsoft said.

Will those replies be accurate? Time will tell.

Google has been preparing for this. In a Minority Report-esque pre-response to the Bing news, Google on Monday announced plans to integrate its vaunted search engine with its own ChatGPT rival called Bard, which will be made available to the public in the coming weeks. Google’s been nervously watching ChatGPT since the chatbot’s release, when it declared the tech a “code red” for Google’s search business.

The race is on

The two tech behemoths are scrambling to capitalize on so-called “generative AI,” with Microsoft motivated by an opportunity to claw back some of Google Search’s market share (~93%), and Google motivated to hold on tight. And, given changing search behavior—younger internet users are increasingly using TikTok and Instagram for recommendations—both companies know that evolution is necessary.

For some sectors, the economic impact of an AI-first era of search could be as rough as ChatGPT’s attempts to write a funny cartoon <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX24_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cff8c2e83>. Publishers would likely lose out on referral clicks, given AI’s direct answers, and the tech giants themselves would need to rethink how their own ad services work.

But Microsoft and Google think the ultimate promise of AI vastly outweighs short-term hiccups, and both are pouring gobs of money into boosting their AI capabilities. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX1M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb023670c>, “I have not seen something like this since I would say 2007–2008, when the cloud was just first coming out.”—MK

Tour de headlines Preside Biden at the State of the Union Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
He’s in love with the State of U: In his fiesty State of the Union address <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX1Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5cca6958>, President Biden touted the booming jobs market, disinflation over the last six months, and new laws such as the Inflation Reduction Act as symbols of the “progress and resilience” of the United States. Though he stressed bipartisanship throughout the speech, he was frequently heckled by some Republicans…and seemed to relish the back-and-forth.

Other SOTU notes: While Biden spent most of his speech recapping his accomplishments, he proposed several agenda items for the remainder of his term, including expanding the $35 price cap on insulin to everyone (not only those on Medicare) and cracking down on excessive fees for things like concert tickets and hotels. As for the spy balloon drama that hovered over the speech, Biden addressed it indirectly, saying if China threatens US sovereignty, “we will act to protect our country. And we did.”

Zoom hits its limit.

CEO Eric Yuan said the “uncertainty of the global economy” was partly to blame, but he also admitted the company “made mistakes.” To own up to those mistakes, Yuan said he’s reducing his upcoming fiscal year salary by 98% and ditching his 2023 corporate bonus. Zoom shares are down about 85% from their 2020 highs.

Two major earthquakes that struck <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C388c3f70> parts of Turkey and Syria on Monday have left more than 7,700 people dead and many more injured. Search efforts for survivors that may still be trapped under collapsed structures are ongoing—but time is running out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cdb452ffe>.

The suddenness of the earthquakes has raised questions over whether anyone could have seen it coming. After all, we’ve long relied on meteorologists for a heads-up on other natural disasters, like hurricanes.

Seismologists say it can’t be done

According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), scientists have failed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc7846112> to predict a single major earthquake. Statistical models can determine the probability of one occurring in a specific region within a few years, but they’re useless for informing folks about when they should evacuate their homes.

The USGS warns that anyone who claims to know when an earthquake is coming based on signs like animal behavior, cloud patterns, or bodily aches is...wrong.

Are there any solutions? Not many. Systems like ShakeAlert (used on the US West Coast) can detect seismic activity at the start of an earthquake and sometimes send out a message to people’s devices up to a minute before they’re hit with heavy shaking.

Looking ahead…scientists are attempting to harness technology to get closer to knowing the likely time and location of potential quakes. However, progress will be incremental, and some experts worry that false alarms may erode public trust in their predictions.—SK

Like going to bed without watching three episodes of Gilmore Girls, your work commute is good for your brain, a new study claims.

In a paper published in the Organizational Psychology Review, researchers propose <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX0E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C61ce9a5a> that a daily commute to and from work offers people a “liminal space” in which they can recharge after work and “mentally switch gears” to their home lives—something the commute to your couch can’t provide.

But before you dust off your travel mug…the researchers slapped a big asterisk on their study: Not all commutes are created equal.

While some study participants reported that lengthier travel made them more relaxed and helped them detach from work, some stressful commutes only compounded problems that began at the office. It turns out that staring at the same bumper sticker to a symphony of blaring horns can really take you out of your post-work zen zone.

Big picture: Despite the potential benefits of commuting, Americans might not race back to the office parking garage if they don’t have to. When US workers shifted to WFH during the pandemic, they got a cumulative ~60 million hours of their lives back, according to the New York Fed.—MM

LeBron has accumulated his points not by pure domination, but by consistency. He led the league in scoring for only one season, but has scored at least 10 points in 1,140 consecutive games (the longest such streak in NBA history).

Microsoft (which invested in ChatGPT) announced its own surprise event scheduled for later today in order to “share some progress on a few exciting projects.”

Chinese tech giant Baidu confirmed it’s on track to introduce its AI chatbot, known as “Ernie Bot” in English, in March.

But meme-stock lovers were all in. Flailing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond saw its value nearly double, while GameStop and AMC stocks both rose. Maybe the home goods chain’s faithful are onto something: After the day’s trading ended, the company announced a plan to stave off bankruptcy with a $1 billion share sale.

Fox announced yesterday that all commercial airtime for Super Bowl LVII is booked up, having sold on average at $6 million for 30 seconds, according to the head of ad sales at Fox Sports—and a lot of those pricey slots went to alcohol companies.

The booze biz has been waiting 33 years for this

Anheuser-Busch (parent company of Budweiser, Stella Artois, and even Natty Light) relinquished the exclusive Super Bowl alcohol advertising rights it held since 1989, and now other brands are keen to get in front of the Super Bowl’s 100 million viewers—many of whom are likely cracking cold ones as they watch.

The global VP of marketing for the Miller brands at Molson Coors told Bloomberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWFY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca687045a> that after hearing the news, “It took us less than 30 seconds to decide that we wanted to buy an ad.”

Heineken, Rémy Martin, and Crown Royal have spots lined up, too.

Anheuser-Busch will still run ads in the game, and will be joined by other familiar (non-booze) brands, including Doritos, Pepsi, and Netflix and GM (it’s a joint ad <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWFc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8802475a>).

Who’s not making it to the big game?

Crypto was the QR code-bouncing star of last year’s commercial breaks, but this year celebrities will promote crypto for exactly zero seconds. That’s because Larry David was unintentionally right when he predicted that crypto company FTX wouldn’t make it…in his Super Bowl ad last year for the now-bankrupt FTX.

Rescue teams have found thousands alive, but the number of victims will also likely increase as their work continues. In addition to the devastating loss of life, ancient sites in the region were damaged, including the Gaziantep Castle in Turkey, which collapsed, and the Aleppo Citadel in Syria.

A neo-Nazi leader and a Maryland woman were arrested last week for allegedly conspiring to attack electrical substations in the area—an act that they purportedly believed would “destroy” the city.

Past Chinese spy balloons escaped detection at the time. The 200-foot-tall suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down by the US on Saturday is not believed to be the first to enter US territory in recent years, but it now appears to be the first the US knew about while it was there. General Glen VanHerck, the head of NORAD (which, in addition to tracking Santa, monitors and protects North American airspace) said yesterday <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce45fcff1> that a “domain awareness gap” allowed three others to float on by during the Trump administration that were only discovered by the intelligence community after the fact.

FTX is flouting the first rule of gift-giving—no take backs. The bankrupt crypto exchange is telling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccb2228dc> recipients of its political donations to return the cash they got from its employees by the end of the month or wait for the judge to order it back.

That’s not a small amount: The company’s ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was once the second-largest Democratic campaign donor (though he has said he quietly gave just as much funding to Republicans as well).

Over a third of lawmakers in the current Congress have some FTX-associated donation on their campaign ledgers, including heavyweights like Rep. Nancy Pelosi and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C37a8a9a6> to CoinDesk.

It’s estimated that FTX-related political donations add up to as much as $93 million in total.

Where is the money now?

After FTX was revealed to be allegedly defrauding investors and customers, counting it among one’s donors became more toxic than swimming in a pool of nuclear waste. Many lawmakers chose to wipe their hands by donating the contributions elsewhere. Only five members of Congress had returned the money to FTX as of mid-January, while several others said they were standing by for further instructions.

Looking forward...all of FTX’s donation recipients could eventually be forced to hand back the funds, but courts tend to work much more slowly than election cycles.—SK

AMC already knows you come to their place for magic. Now, you can go there to replicate the energy of shuffling through the Delta first-class cabin with a stale bagel on your way to seat 38E (bathroom adjacent). The theater chain is introducing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWEI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C31d70d74> a tiered ticket-pricing scheme based on your seat location, similar to airlines, sporting events, and concerts.

AMC is hoping that charging a bit extra for the middle seats will help boost revenue in a more consistent way than just waiting for new Avatars to come out. The seating tiers, part of a program called Sightline, will reflect the demand patterns you can observe in any theater:

Value: Generally bad front-row seats (for a discount)

Standard: Common seats (for the traditional ticket price)

Preferred: The good middle seats that fill up first (for a premium price)

While the location of your seat will soon impact your ticket price, what movie you’re seeing won’t. The chain can’t vary prices of individual films because tickets are priced by a contract between studios and theaters. Pricing by demand has also been avoided, since it would require more complex monitoring and cost theaters money.

Looking ahead…AMC plans to roll out Sightline at some locations in New York, Chicago, and Kansas City this Friday, and is aiming to expand nationwide by the end of the year.—MK

Good morning. One small formatting update before we get into the news: In an effort to better organize our recommendations in the “Brew’s Bets” section, we’re going to borrow a page from our Sunday newsletter and call that section the “To-do List” every day of the week. The content isn’t changing a lick—our aim is to add more consistency and clarity for you.

That’s it from me. Have a great day.

Nearly a decade into its combat service in the US military, the F-22 Raptor fighter jet finally completed its first air-to-air strike. It took out a balloon.

As excited onlookers watched from Myrtle Beach, the jet climbed to 58,000 feet and downed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30462806.3037099/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVEY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ2MjgwNi4zMDM3MDk5/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C17c2c5da> a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. The balloon’s debris was scattered across seven miles of the sea—but the geopolitical fallout from its doomed voyage is much wider.

Here’s what you need to know about balloongate.

Why wait to shoot it down? The US knew that the balloon had entered its air defense zone on Jan. 28, well before it floated across North America. President Biden wanted to shoot the balloon down last Wednesday, when it was hovering above Montana, but military leaders recommended waiting until no Americans were in harm’s way when its remnants came crashing down.

Biden was attacked by Republicans, who wanted him to destroy the balloon much earlier and called it a “projection of weakness” to allow a Chinese surveillance tool to enjoy unfettered access to our amber waves of grain. But the Pentagon actually thinks the balloon played into the Americans’ hands—they were able to study the balloon as it floated, and an analysis of the debris will teach them even more about Chinese espionage tactics.

What is China’s response? The foreign ministry called the balloon pop a “clear overreaction” and suggested it could retaliate. China never admitted the balloon was intended for spying—claiming instead it was a meteorology research airship that got blown off its course. The US isn’t buying that.

Were there other Chinese spy balloons? Yes, and pretty recently, too. Chinese surveillance balloons entered US airspace at least three times during the Trump administration and once previously while Biden was president, a senior defense official said. And there’s also one currently floating above Latin America, the Pentagon revealed on Saturday.

What happens next? The balloon drama will only deepen the distrust between rivals US and China—it already led Secretary of State Antony Blinken to call off his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But China’s relatively muted response to the balloon downing suggests it may let the hot air blow over...just like the US did.

The preliminary death toll was at least 195 people, but that number is expected to rise. Compounding the damage: Many of the residential buildings in the region near the epicenter are of low-quality construction, making them susceptible to shaking, per the United States Geological Survey.

Close call at Austin’s airport.

Investigators are looking into the incident, which may have been caused by an air traffic controller double-booking a runway (the Southwest plane was taking off right as the FedEx one was landing). This is the second near-collision in as many months—authorities are investigating a close call on a JFK runway that occurred in January.

Irving’s four-season ride with the Nets was a bumpy one—he missed 35 home games under NYC’s Covid vaccination policy, and earlier this season was suspended for posting a link to an antisemitic movie on Twitter. Expect a flurry of other moves ahead of the NBA trade deadline on Thursday.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress Hey Arnold saying Hey Arnold!/Paramount Global Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even channel your inner Mulder and Scully.

Your friends are good for you. Since the days of Freud, we’ve known that talking helps you feel better, but new research shows that even a single conversation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUUw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb66f84b5> with a friend per day is enough to boost your happiness and lower stress. While the conversation needs to be “quality” to improve your day, that can mean anything from deep discussions to just catching up or joking around. And if you need some motivation to leave the house: The study determined in-person interactions were better for well-being than yakking it up in the TikTok comments.

🫦 Virtual temptation might help your IRL relationship. Here’s a use case for the metaverse even Zuck probably hasn’t thought of yet: A research team in Israel found that flirting with a seductive VR character can help fend off infidelity. The team conducted experiments <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUU0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C08fff5e6> where participants strapped on a VR headset, entered a virtual bar, and chatted up the (simulated) bartender. The researchers observed that a little bit of virtual temptation works like an anti-cheating vaccine, inoculating you against IRL threats to your relationship.

The truth is out there, and AI is looking for it. An international group of scientists has begun to use AI to hunt for aliens <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUU4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C84600b01>—and not by asking ChatGPT “Tell me where aliens are located in the style of Pulp Fiction.” Instead, they’re using machine-learning algorithms to sift through huge quantities of data to detect alien transmitters on distant planets. So far, the tech has helped researchers home in on eight signals with possible extraterrestrial origins (though they disappeared when scientists tried to find them again—those little green creatures are wily).—AR

The Canadian province started a three-year hard drug decriminalization trial run <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUi0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8e740ae5> on Tuesday.

While it will still be unlawful to sell and traffic these drugs, as well as to bring them into airports and schools, possessing small quantities (less than 2.5 grams, or one-tenth of an ounce) for personal use won’t be penalized.

* Adults carrying that amount of opioids like heroin and fentanyl, as well as cocaine, meth, or ecstasy, will no longer run afoul of the law.

* Police will not seize the drugs, and users will be informed about resources for substance abuse recovery.

But as they went into effect this week, the new rules stirred up questions about whether they’ll actually work.

Good intentions, but mixed responses

The law aims to move toward treating drug abuse as a public health issue rather than one that requires handcuffs. BC’s government hopes that the new approach “will help reduce the barriers and stigma that prevent people from accessing life-saving supports and services.”

Many activists welcome the reform, arguing that it’ll relocate drug use to safer spaces and make it easier for users to seek recovery care. Groups like the international HIV advocacy organization UNAIDs have long advocated for decriminalization as a way to reduce the spreading of the disease via needle sharing.

But many drug users and recovery advocates see the BC law as a “half measure”: Various stakeholders (including <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce2ebfe0f> the provincial government itself) believe the 2.5-gram threshold is too low to accommodate heavy drug users and those who buy in bulk. Experts also point to a lack of access to safe drugs and a shortage of spaces in treatment programs, with many provincial officials acknowledging that more needs to be done.

So, how has decriminalization fared before?

British Columbia isn’t the only place to try “decrim,” as the approach is known. Portugal, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic have all adopted some form of it. It’s even being tried in the US: In 2021, Oregon became the first (and so far the only) state to decriminalize all drugs after the policy passed as a ballot measure.

Portugal is the standard-bearer for decrim success: Instituted in 2001 amid a devastating heroin epidemic, the country has seen drug-related deaths plummet. Though fatal overdoses have since risen, drug death rates remain below <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc528034c> the EU average.

Oregon, meanwhile, has posted mixed results, and the measure remains controversial. Despite its expansion of resources for those with substance abuse disorders, the state experienced a faster-than-nationwide-average rise in overdose deaths for the year 2021, and some observers point to low uptake of treatment programs.

Zoom out: Other Canadian provinces and governments abroad have their notepads out, preparing to watch BC’s experiment closely. But even decrim proponents acknowledge that the strategy can’t work on its own and must be paired with shifting resources toward healthcare and fighting addiction.—SK

In last Sunday’s episode of The Last of Us, the HBO drama got Massholes even more riled up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4a177936> than usual by claiming this mountainous landscape was located 10 miles west of Boston. New Englanders called BS by pointing out: a) that is not what eastern Massachusetts looks like and b) the only thing wild about the place is the logos on quarter-zips.

Plus, the show was primarily filmed in rugged Alberta, Canada, which seems much more likely to be the setting for the shot.

So what actually is 10 miles from Boston? Well, it’s Massachusetts, so a cluster of college campuses, including Boston College, Wellesley, Brandeis, Bentley, and Babson. That area is also home to the very lovely and very Massachusetts-sounding suburbs of Waltham, Watertown, and Newton.

Sound like a nice place to live? Sure is, but it’ll cost you: The median sale price for a home in Newton was $1.2 million in December, according to Redfin.—NF

The seemingly endless announcements of mass layoffs notwithstanding, Americans haven’t been this employed in more than fifty years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9217f1e5> yesterday that the US added a whopping 517,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate dropped slightly, to 3.4%—the lowest it’s been since 1969.

The jump in new hires was almost triple what experts predicted and amounts to the biggest monthly gain since July. So, where has “you’re hired!” been exclaimed the most?

The most jobs created were in leisure and hospitality (128,000), professional and business services (82,000), and government (74,000), with the last figure partially due to formerly striking state university employees returning to work.

The news of the January jobs jump comes on the heels of a Department of Labor report that said over 11 million jobs were open at the end of last year. So, while tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon have all laid people off, many workers may be getting both severance packages and job offers. The IT industry was still looking to fill 109,000 job openings as of December, and IT folks were wanted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xU18_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc3978768> at companies like PwC and Northrop Grumman.

Why no one saw this coming

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the eighth time since last March as part of its ongoing efforts to combat historic inflation. As any freshman economics textbook will tell you, the Fed’s moves are liable to drive up unemployment and threaten to tip the economy into a recession.

But this round of jobs data suggests that we must be living in a parallel reality, where the laws of economics don’t apply: Job growth just keeps on trucking, while inflation has been slowing.

Looking forward: The rapid job creation dampens hopes that the Fed will stop raising interest rates in the next few months. But a labor market seemingly signaling “can’t nobody hold me down” eases fears of an impending recession.—SK

You wouldn’t waste time or money on a bad relationship, so why do that with your skincare? 90% of traditional products never actually absorb into the skin—they’re wiped or sweated off before making a difference.

The result feels like a gentle mist but delivers an injectable alternative without needles or pain. This means ingredients like collagen, often notoriously too large for absorption, can absorb into the skin successfully, leaving it hydrated and plump.

Investors had been seeking billions of dollars in damages to cover their losses due to a sell-off that took place in the days after the tweet.

Not since Balloon Boy has a balloon flying over the Rocky Mountain region caused such a kerfuffle: Yesterday, the US canceled <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVDg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cec98377f> the secretary of state’s planned visit to China after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was spotted over military sites in Montana before drifting eastward.

China claimed the object, which is still floating over the US, is merely a “civilian airship” conducting weather research that got blown off course, and expressed “regrets” for the incident. The Pentagon, however, is giving that as much credence as it would a liposuctioned celebrity paid to hawk weight loss teas.

Why bother with a balloon when China has satellites and TikTok to spy with? The older technology is cheaper to deploy and can be fitted with modern tech like cameras and radar sensors.  Plus, they can linger over a spot longer than satellites can. But experts say the most likely reason China went with a balloon was to make a statement <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVDk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf9a76a75> that it’s ready to take the US on. It likely even wanted to get caught snooping.

Zoom out: This probably isn’t going to help warm up the frosty relations between the US and China. The two countries have  been going at each other lately over issues like chip technology and the status of Taiwan.—AR

Social media posts of people touching, licking, and otherwise messing with food as it travels by at conveyor belt restaurants have gone viral and caused some to question Japan’s communal values.

What’s going on?

At the end of January, the term “sushi tero” (which means sushi terrorism) was used to caption a video of someone licking the inside of cups and soy sauce bottle caps at the “sushi train” chain, Sushiro. The clip has over 40 million views on Twitter, made the rounds on Japanese broadcast news, and caused the stock of the restaurant’s parent company to drop <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVGY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C32795746> 5% on Tuesday.

Before that clip ignited the trend by naming it, videos of other fishy acts—like slathering passing sushi with wasabi—had gone viral throughout the month. These incidents, explains the Japan Times <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVGc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1d4bb421>, stem from a wider, yearslong trend.

Zoom out: Conveyor belt restaurants are a 740 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, industry in Japan, per Teikoku Databank. Restaurant chains affected by sushi terrorism are taking legal action, as well as replacing circuitous belts with straight-to-the-customer ones or powering them down entirely. Some worry “trust-based businesses” like these simply don’t work in modern Japan.—JW

Good morning. In the words of Jack Black, “Math is a really cool thing.”

Here’s one reason why: The number of minutes in February (in non-leap years) is equivalent to 8 factorial. As Tim Urban calculated <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTnY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2f3b0632>…

February has 28 days (7 x 4)

Each day has 24 hours (8 x 3)

Each hour has 60 minutes (6 x 5 x 2)

So, the number of minutes in February is 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, aka 8! Neat!

Markets: If you hung on to your tech stocks during the rout of 2022, you’ve got to be feeling good right now. After another smashing day, the tech-focused Nasdaq is off to its best start to a year since 1975. Meta played an outsized role—the company’s stock posted its biggest single-day gain in almost 10 years after Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the “year of efficiency.”

On tap today: the January jobs report. It’ll provide crucial insight into a labor market that’s giving more mixed signals than TJ’s Philly Cheesesteak Bao Buns. On the one hand, jobless claims dropped to a nine-month low last week. On the other, US employers announced more than 100,000 job cuts in January, which amounts to the most monthly layoffs since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Enter Gautam Adani. In the week since the Indian mogul was targeted by a short seller, his businesses have lost a combined $108 billion in value, and his own net worth has plummeted by $52 billion. Because Adani was once the second-richest person in the world, he’s still got plenty left in the bank. But, as Bloomberg notes <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTng_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7cc408d1>, his downfall “defies just about every historical comparison.”

Given Adani’s sprawling business empire and his cozy relationship with India’s leadership class, this crisis has echoed across both markets and politics. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know about the most important story in global business this week.

Who is Adani and how did he get so rich? Adani, who grew up middle-class, dropped out of college to trade diamonds and eventually formed his own business hawking other physical products. During the ’90s his ambitions expanded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTnk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb13794f8> along with the Indian economy, and he now runs a conglomerate that encompasses energy, transportation infrastructure such as ports and airports, defense manufacturing, and media.

What sparked the collapse? On Jan. 24, a US short seller named Hindenburg Research claimed Adani’s empire pulled “the largest con in corporate history,” accusing it of stock manipulation and accounting fraud in a 100-page report. Adani has denied the allegations, but his pushback hasn’t comforted spooked investors…especially after he scrapped a $2.5 billion share sale on Wednesday. 

How has this infiltrated politics? Adani responded that Hindenburg’s report wasn’t just an attack on him, it amounted to a “calculated attack on India…and the growth story and ambition of India.” Adani’s business ventures have aligned closely with the priorities of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Modi’s political opponents are seizing on the fiasco to highlight the relationship between India’s leader and Adani.

What happens next? Adani emphasized that his company’s fundamentals remain “very strong” and its balance sheet “healthy.” Still, experts say the accusations could leave a lasting reputational stain on India’s largest corporations and hamstring their ability to grow.—NF

YouTuber MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson) has moved on from recreating Squid Game to going creative mode on the US healthcare system. The 24-year-old and world’s most popular YouTuber uploaded a video <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRmw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C88c56be4> over the weekend that revealed he funded cataract surgery for 1,000 people.

The video, titled “1,000 Blind People See For The First Time,” has garnered more than 77 million views on Donaldson’s channel, but sparked debates around the use of philanthropy as a revenue driver and prompted some viewers to express frustration with medical expenses in the country.

The surgery costs about $3,500 per eye, according to MyVision.org, and the participants in MrBeast’s video weren’t able to afford medical insurance.

Criticism of the video focused primarily on the broader implications of an altruistic YouTuber funding surgeries as content, but some are more generally unsettled by the idea that the MrBeast channel—which has featured videos of people being paid to live in a windowless room and stay in a circle in the middle of nowhere for 100 days—is earning revenue off of charitable acts.

To his critics, MrBeast responded:

And it’s not so Jamie Dimon can cosplay Snow White: Buying timberland has become trendy for long-term investors because trees are not only worth something when cut down, but also when left standing.

Why? In this era of corporate sustainability pledges, companies are hungrily buying up carbon offsets—tradable certificates that represent the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere—to counteract their own carbon output. One of the most popular types of carbon offsets pays lumberjacks to lay down their chainsaws and preserve naturally CO2-absorbing forests for a period of time.

That’s changed the game for timberland owners (and we don’t mean Drake). “Rather than waiting to get paid, they can now get paid to wait,” the global head of alternative investments for JPMorgan, which plans to use its new forest for both wood production and carbon offsets, wrote <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTlU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f09bc2f> in a September blog post.

Yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did his best impression of a football coach whose team holds a third-quarter lead: Our game plan to tame inflation is working so far, he suggested, but don’t douse me in Gatorade just yet.

Following the Fed’s first meeting of the year, the central bank hiked interest rates <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C55620ab2> by the expected 25 basis points. It’s the smallest rate hike since last March, and a sign that the Fed’s bitter struggle to rein in prices is having an impact.

Annual inflation fell to 6.5% in December from a peak of 9.1% in June.

There’s even a good chance your Super Bowl party will cost less <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0698ee78> than last year’s. Prices for chicken wings, avocados, and steak have all fallen since last January (along with those of many other goods).

In a closely watched press conference, Powell emphasized “it is a good thing” that prices are coming down in many sectors.

But he isn’t ready to hang up the “Mission Accomplished” banner

Powell made it clear that Americans should expect “a couple more rate hikes” going forward. The concern? Inflation is a nasty beast—there’s no guarantee it’s going to keep on falling like it has been.

And some economists have pointed to signs that activity is picking back up again <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C43f3aba7> right when we need it to continue slowing down. Housing demand is coming off of its lows, gas prices have climbed since December, and the labor market is still running too hot for the Fed’s liking.

Making things even dicier for Powell is the recent stock market rally. So far in 2023, investors have been gobbling up stocks as if the inflation problem has already been solved. But, in an ironic twist, their optimism that inflation is toast…could actually push inflation higher by boosting asset prices.

If there’s one lesson to be learned from all of this, it’s never go into macroeconomics if you value getting things right the first time.—NF

McCarthy said after the meeting that he believed the two would ultimately “find common ground.” Let’s hope so, since the alternative is the US being unable to pay its bills come June.

Tom Brady celebrated the one-year anniversary of his retirement announcement with...another retirement announcement. The seven-time Super Bowl winner and (until yesterday) the NFL’s oldest active player announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xSzc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce83c9995> the decision on social media, capping a legendary 23-year career.

Brady’s days tossin’ the ol’ pigskin around might be over, but the 45-year-old is retiring at the top of several major all-time record lists. He’s No. 1 in passing completions (7,753), touchdowns (649) and yards (89,214).

And, despite taking a reportedly ungodly loss from his financial stake in FTX, Brady has set up a comfortable nest egg in case you were worried. Last year, #12 signed a 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox to become the network’s primary analyst beginning whenever he decided to retire.

That’s more than Brady made playing in the NFL and the biggest contract in sports television, by the way.

Zoom out: In recent years, networks have written massive checks to lock in star broadcast talent—inking deals worth more than $1 billion for pro talkers like Brady, Troy Aikman, Joe Buck, and Tony Romo.—MK

Netflix doesn’t care if you’re “just a baby;” it’s kicking you off <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS3A_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C383b9d06> your parents’ account if you don’t actually live with them. Netflix support pages, spotted yesterday by The Streamable before they got taken down, laid out a plan to cut back on password sharing by chaining accounts to a single location.

The streaming giant hasn’t confirmed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS3E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cba8bc19b> the new terms, but it has made it clear it wants to end password sharing. The plan would require users to pick a “primary location” through their TV (or pick for them if they don’t). If devices with that selected location don’t access Netflix using the location’s wi-fi at least once every 31 days, the account owner will have to pay an “extra member” fee or the user will be barred from binging Wednesday on that device.

This ruthless update wouldn’t be the first time Netflix has cracked down on password sharing after it lost subscribers for two consecutive quarters last year for the first time ever. Netflix has already…

Rolled out new features that allow users to kick profiles off their own accounts and let booted users transfer their watch history to a new account.

Started charging fees for extra users in select countries in Latin America, where password sharing runs particularly rampant.

The strategy’s working: Starting to root out password sharing—along with the launch of a cheaper, ad-supported tier <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS3I_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3a3ba804> in some countries—has already helped Netflix recoup subscribers.

Good morning. It’s a new month, which means that a fresh slate of shows and movies are hitting streaming services.

One we might skip: Pixar is releasing a short that shows Carl Fredricksen from Up going on his first date since his wife Ellie died. For everyone who’s only now beginning to recover from that tear-jerker of a montage at the beginning of the movie…it’s still too soon to be sending Carl back on the market.

What’s next? Nemo goes to college and we have to watch Marlin process his feelings about being an empty nester? We can only take so much…

Yesterday’s game ball went to Spotify, which revealed strong user growth last quarter.

On tap today: meetings that could not have been emails. The Fed is expected to announce an interest rate hike of 25 basis points, which would represent a downshift from a series of larger hikes in 2022. Across town, President Biden will meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to hopefully make progress on the looming debt ceiling crisis.

The same biotech startup that plans to “resurrect” the woolly mammoth announced a fresh round of funding that’s aimed at de-extincting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1248fbbe> the famously extinct dodo. Which means if they next try to revive that freaky little squirrel who loves acorns, we can really get cooking on this live-action Ice Age reboot.

Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company in question, said Tuesday that it raised $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, bringing its total funding since 2021 to $225 million, per Bloomberg.

About the dodo: For a company in the de-extinction space, the dodo is something of a white whale. Hunting and habitat takeover led to its demise in the late 1600s, and it’s the poster bird for human-caused extinction. A preserved specimen in a Danish museum provided enough dodo DNA for Colossal to get the project off the ground (something the dodo could not do, notably).

A long and controversial road ahead

The dodo is the third species Colossal has said it will attempt to revive after pledging to bring back the woolly mammoth <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRlE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C919a23d1> and the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger). As you might imagine, the process isn’t straightforward, and will involve editing the genomes of closely related (living) species and selectively breeding them to create “functional” dodos, mammoths, and thylacines.

Not everyone thinks this is a smart idea. Critics say that de-extinction is an ethical minefield, as it directs resources away from conserving and protecting species that are currently at risk of extinction.

Obviously, none of this will happen overnight, and each step in the process will take years. The company claims it will produce woolly mammoth calves by 2028.

Zoom out: Are Colossal’s investors (which include Paris Hilton, Tony Robbins, and CIA-sponsored VC firm In-Q-Tel) just obsessed with old birds?

That fanfare stems from revelations that Santos fabricated much of his background, including false claims that he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.

Thanks to booming energy prices, Exxon made $56 billion in profit last year—equivalent to $6.3 million each hour, per Reuters. The mind-boggling earnings of Western oil giants, which are projected to have been ~$200 billion collectively last year, have also made them a political target for the Biden adminstration, which has blamed them for high gas prices.

The details: To access free wi-fi on Delta flights, you’ll need to sign in to your Delta SkyMiles frequent flyer account (but that’s also free). Once you do, a time-sucking Netflix binge awaits: Delta says its Viasat-powered internet will give you “video-streaming capable wi-fi speeds…from takeoff to touchdown.”

Why is Delta doing this? Airlines are locked in a fierce competition to capitalize on the travel boom coming out of the pandemic. In-flight wi-fi that’s free and reliable could help them win over customers—especially the bigwigs who fly business class and need to send one-word emails. This isn’t a small investment for Delta: CEO Ed Bastian said the company has spent more than $1 billion on free wi-fi.

Zoom out: Delta’s move will put pressure on other airlines to go full Starbucks. Currently, JetBlue is the only other large US airline that offers free wi-fi, but American is in trial mode and Hawaii Airlines could launch free wi-fi later this year through SpaceX’s Starlink service.—NF

Paging Benoit Blanc: Your detective services are required at the Dallas Zoo, where a string of fishy occurrences has perplexed authorities in recent weeks. The latest mystery? Missing monkeys.

Zoo officials said that two emperor tamarin monkeys had gone missing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRlM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceaaa351d> from their enclosures since Monday. The monkeys were found last night in a nearby abandoned house, but they probably didn’t go looking for a starter home by themselves—their habitat was “intentionally compromised,” officials said. In other words, someone broke them out.

The tamarin monkeys incident follows other head-scratchers at the Dallas Zoo:

A clouded leopard that went missing last month was later found outside her cage. Zoo workers discovered an intentional cut in her enclosure and similar tampering in the habitat of the zoo’s langur monkeys.

One of the Dallas Zoo’s endangered vultures was found dead last week with “an unusual wound and injuries,” per CNN.

Good morning.

It’s the first time since the pandemic hit that return-to-office rates exceeded 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Depending on your perspective, the takeaway could be that offices are half full…or remain half empty.

It looks like electric vehicle Black Friday has officially kicked off. Ford announced yesterday that it’ll cut prices on its electric Mustang Mach-E models by as much as 8%, putting the price range at about $46,000 to $64,000—which means it’ll be selling some of them at a loss.

The move follows the unprecedented and sweeping discounts that rival EV manufacturer Tesla rolled out earlier this month. Both companies hope that making the cars cheaper will convince more customers to buy them.

Why discount now?

Demand for pricey EVs is under threat as high interest rates make financing auto purchases more expensive and recession fears leave people less willing to crack open their piggy banks to snag dream cars. Ford and Tesla may also be considering the government tax credits, worth up to $7,500, for EVs priced under a certain threshold (some Tesla and Mach-E models will now be eligible). And there’s more competition <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQnQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C48e972e2> from automakers like Nissan and Chevrolet producing increasingly cheap EVs.But it’s not just EVs becoming more affordable:

New car prices have been slowing their ascent, and used cars were 9% cheaper last month compared to a year prior, when your 200k-miles-strong 2006 Corolla was a hot commodity amid supply chain issues and parts shortages.

Not everyone is celebrating

Many people who purchased a Tesla shortly before the price cuts are not thrilled about having to make hefty loan payments on what is now a less valuable depreciating asset. Some disgruntled Tesla buyers signed a petition demanding free or discounted software downloads for their vehicles, while others have inquired about refunds, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Big picture: Major automakers, which enjoyed soaring profits last year, are now bracing for a reversal of fortunes and looking at ways to cut costs. But difficulties notwithstanding, many companies are still ramping up EV production and legacy car manufacturers are pushing forward with electrification goals.—SK

Although Hemphill’s lawyer told the Associated Press he was not present during the violence that killed Nichols, the officer was present for the traffic stop that preceded it, and body cam footage appears to show him saying he had tased Nichols and “I hope they stomp his ass.” In addition, three employees of the Memphis Fire Department were fired yesterday for their involvement. Nichols’s funeral tomorrow will be held tomorrow.

The White House disclosed the plan yesterday while opposing efforts by Republican lawmakers to end the emergency declarations immediately with a bill called the Pandemic Is Over Act. The end of the emergencies will mean that many Americans will have to start paying for Covid tests, treatments, and vaccines. It also signals a shift in how serious the government considers the pandemic to be.

Luxury retailer Hermès and non-fungible token designer Mason Rothschild faced off in court yesterday in the first major test of how trademark law applies to NFTs and other digital designs.

Hermès claims Rothschild infringed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQkE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C38c0d6c6> on its trademark by digitally depicting furry versions of its iconic Birkin bag in his collection of 100 “MetaBirkin” NFTs. But Rothschild argues that MetaBirkins are a lawful, artistic interpretation of the brand’s product—similar to Andy Warhol’s prints of Campbell’s soup cans.

Dolce & Gabbana sold nine NFTs for about $6 million in September 2021.

Gucci bagged $25,000 on one short-film NFT two months prior.

MetaBirkens debuted at Art Basel in December 2021, and were sold and resold for tens of thousands of dollars. The platform they were originally listed on, OpenSea, pulled the collection at Hermès’s request, but copies continued to sell elsewhere.

Riseborough’s nomination for her performance in To Leslie surprised Hollywood when it was announced, as the film had seemingly less heat than some Roku originals. To Leslie made less than $28,000 at the box office in a limited theatrical run. But in the waning days of the nominations voting period, endorsements poured in from stars like Jennifer Aniston, Kate Winslet, and Edward Norton. Cate Blanchett (also a nominee) even mentioned Riseborough in her Critics Choice Award acceptance speech.

What’s the issue? Well, there are many rules involved in Oscars voting, and in its campaign to receive votes, To Leslie may have violated a few. Potential issues are: a rule against contacting voters directly and encouraging promotion, and a rule against singling out competing nominees by name.

Zoom out: Most insiders predict that Riseborough’s nomination will be upheld, but some in the industry are upset that it takes away a place for lauded performances from Black actresses, like Danielle Deadwyler and Viola Davis, to be celebrated. Nominations have only been rescinded nine times in the history of the Oscars, and never for an acting nomination.—MK

Good morning. Scratch that, great morning because the Eagles are going to the Super Bowl . After dispatching the 49ers, the Birds will square off against the Chiefs, who beat the Bengals in a thrilling game.

And for the cherry on top: Unlike the Phillies, the Eagles winning a championship has not been found to be correlated with a recession.

Thirty years ago yesterday, the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US launched. In the decades since, these once-niche investment products have become ubiquitous on Wall Street, disrupting the mutual fund industry and transforming people’s relationship with the stock market.

You always remember your first

On Jan. 29, 1993, a dumb-looking spider decoration hanging in the American Stock Exchange heralded the arrival <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbe385e70> of the first US ETF—what’s now called the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. It had a measly $6.5 million in assets and no one really paid much attention to it.

That’s changed. The first US ETF is now the world’s biggest, with $375 billion in assets, and the ETF sector in total had amassed $6.5 trillion in assets by the end of 2022. While mutual funds still have 3x the amount of assets that ETFs have, the tide is turning: Investors poured $600 billion into US ETFs on a net basis last year, but pulled out almost $1 trillion from mutual funds.

So, how does an ETF work and why have they become so popular? An ETF is simply a security that tracks the performance of a particular basket of investments, like stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, for example, tracks the performance of companies in the S&P 500. Many other ETFs also track indexes, allowing people to park their money in funds that follow the ebbs and flows of the broader market.

If that sounds like a mutual fund…it’s similar. But ETFs have a few advantages <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca0b5a3d0> over its stuffy, older cousin.

ETFs generally have lower fees than mutual funds.

They have built-in tax benefits.

They’re accessible to anyone with a brokerage account—you can buy or sell them like you would a stock.

Zoom out: All these advantages aside, the rise of ETFs has been also fueled by the growing recognition that trying to invest in individual stocks is foolish. Passive index funds, which aren’t designed for frequent trading, have surged to represent almost half <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbe4b1243> of US fund assets, compared to less than 2% in the early ’90s.

Authorities are frantically combing the desert in Western Australia to locate a tiny but highly radioactive capsule that was lost <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd0U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6675498c> in the vast, arid expanse.

The capsule seems to have fallen off a truck that was transporting it from a mine in the northern part of Western Australia to a suburb of Perth, the region’s largest city. And finding it won’t be simple: The route was 870 miles long and the capsule is smaller than a penny.

But what it lacks in size, the capsule makes up for in radiation. Containing the radioactive isotope cesium-137, the capsule emits the equivalent of 10 X-rays in an hour. Contact could cause burns, radiation sickness, and skin damage, and prolonged exposure could lead to cancer.

So, what’s it even used for? Mining companies deploy these capsules as sensors to calculate things like the thickness of pipes. The mining company that managed to lose this capsule, industry giant Rio Tinto, apologized and said it was launching an investigation into the perplexing circumstances of how this tiny object fell off a truck.

The week ahead Fed Chair Jerome Powell Dianna “Mick” McDougall, Sources: Getty Images
A huge week for the economy: Following its first meeting of the year on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates by just 0.25%—a sign that its campaign to slow inflation is working. Also, the January employment report drops on Friday, which is projected to show sustained job growth despite all the layoff headlines.

Big Tech earnings: There’s an earnings report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd0k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C39ef37ed> for everyone this week, whether you’re curious about hardware (Apple), retail (Amazon), or saturated fats (McDonald’s). Plus, Meta and Alphabet will give us crucial insight into the teetering digital ad market.

It could be visible to the naked eye this week in the Northern Hemisphere, though binoculars will certainly help.

Everything else…

February, and Black History Month, begin on Wednesday.

Groundhog Day is on Thursday—and maybe on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday…who knows?

In a 413-page rebuttal of those allegations, Adani claimed it did nothing wrong and argued that short seller Hindenburg was the company committing fraud.

Good morning. Can ChatGPT write a funny comic? Max wanted to know. So he asked the chatbot to provide a topic for his Saturday Sketch, and then faithfully drew up the response.

We’ll let you judge the quality of the joke yourself, but at least from our POV…Max shouldn’t lose sleep over AI taking his job. For now.

Goldman Sachs tightened its belt at the expense of its CEO’s wallet. The investment bank announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdlM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce327bb26> yesterday that CEO David Solomon received a 29% pay cut in 2022. But it’s unlikely that he’ll be staging a walkout, as his new compensation still came in at a not-too-shabby $25 million.

Solomon’s shrinking paycheck reflects the financial struggles that have been plaguing the bank under his leadership:

Goldman Sachs has lost $3 billion since 2020 on its troubled foray into commercial banking, and its profits declined last year amid a slowing economy.

The bank let 3,200 employees go this month, its biggest layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis, according to the New York Times.

But Solomon is not the only CEO to see his pay package get smaller. Rival bank Morgan Stanley, as well as Apple and Alphabet, have all recently cut CEO compensation (in most cases alongside layoffs).

Why are executive pay cuts so hot right now?

Slashing executives’ pay is a cost-cutting measure that doubles as a way to signal that bosses are weathering economic headwinds alongside rank-and-file workers.

A 2021 study from Oxford University showed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdlQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C32e0cb70> that companies that prioritize paying employees over managers in difficult times tend to get a better rep with customers. It can also be a way to placate disgruntled shareholders who are not too pleased to sponsor the caviar-filled lifestyles of company leaders as they watch their investments dip into red territory.

Zoom out: CEOs still aren’t exactly hurting. The heads of the biggest US companies made 399 times more than the average worker in 2021, according to the Economic Policy Institute, an almost 20-fold increase in the pay ratio since 1965.—SK

Though the stock only ended up falling 6.4% by the time the market closed yesterday, Wall Street definitely took notice of the company’s troubles: Twenty-one analysts slashed what they thought it was worth, and many did not hold back in describing the chipmaker’s fall. “No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,” one said.

The timing is particularly bad for Adani, as yesterday marked the beginning of a planned $2.45 billion share sale.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it can’t vouch for the safety of cannabidiol <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdi0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3621215c> (CBD)—a nonpsychoactive compound found in marijuana and hemp plants—and because of that, it can’t regulate it. Instead, it’s calling on lawmakers to help supervise $12 CBD lavender sodas.

Why? The FDA said that CBD doesn’t fit the mold of the dietary supplements and food additives it typically monitors, such as ginseng and caffeine. The agency claims the science is lacking on the safety of long-term CBD use, let alone on any potential perks—like preventing diabetes or aiding sleep.

This game of legal Hacky Sack is a major drag for CBD advocates

Congress legalized hemp four years ago, and most CBD is derived from hemp, not marijuana. As a result, CBD got kicked off the controlled substances list and got lobbed from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s desk to the FDA’s.

Since then, the FDA’s been less active in regulating CBD than a teen in a ’90s anti-marijuana ad. That’s resulted in a chaotic and confusing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdl8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C784f2c52> marketplace, and CBD industry players were hoping the FDA would soon start reining it in.

Looking ahead…while CBD advocates expressed frustration at getting sent back to square one, some members of Congress are optimistic that they can finally sort the issue out.—JW

Oh, to be an Amsterdammer—free from finessing a U-lock onto a frozen street sign. A new $65 million bike parking garage <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdzQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb1510da4> opened Wednesday in the largest city in the Netherlands, and it is all underwater.

Going under…the facility is at Amsterdam’s Centraal Station, which sees roughly 200,000 travelers arrive per day—about half by bike. To access the new parking facility, you can bike right up to the moving walkways that take you and your wheels into the depths of what used to be just canal water. The structure took four years to build and can hold 7,000 bikes. Its capacity will increase to 11,000 when a second structure opens in February. (Here’s a pretty sick time lapse <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdzU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C37d934f0> of how they drained all that water and built the garage.)

While it cost a lot to build, the parking is cheaper than most bus fares in the US: Parking is free for the first 24 hours and roughly $1.46 per day after that.

Big picture: This new facility is a logical investment for a country in which bicycles outnumber the residents. Dutch people are the most physically active on the planet primarily because biking is such a huge part of their daily lives, according to a 2021 study from global research firm Ipsos.—MM

Good morning. TIL there is such a thing as “burrito season.” Chipotle said yesterday it’s hiring 15,000 employees to prep for “burrito season”—the period from March–May that represents its busiest sales stretch on the calendar.

So if we’re getting this right…

March–May: burrito season

June–August: ribs season

September: soup season

October: spooky season

November: Soup Season 2: The Return of the Soup

ECONOMY

How’s the economy doing? <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D5efcc8d3> Larry David saying <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E5efcc8d3> Curb Your Enthusiasm/HBO via Giphy
Larry David’s favorite tagline also happens to be an apt description of the economy right now: It’s pretty, pretty good.

US gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at a 2.9% annualized pace <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C91286dd9> in Q4 2022, which topped expectations. And it’s rock-solid proof that the recession we’ve been warned about for months ain’t here yet.

Not only has the US economy regained <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C840b50c3> all the lost output from the Covid recession, but it’s also returned to its growth trajectory from before the pandemic. Real GDP per capita, which factors in inflation, has reached its highest level ever.

Is this a sign of a “soft landing”? Q4’s strong GDP numbers add fuel to the argument that the Fed could actually pull off the tricky “soft landing”—where it knocks down inflation through interest rate hikes without sending economic growth into reverse. The resilient labor market is cooperating: Despite all the headlines about layoffs, jobless claims fell last week to their lowest point since April 2022.

But don’t write off a recession just yet

Economists combing through the GDP report found a few warning signs that indicate a recession remains a clear and present danger. Here are a few:

Consumers are pulling back. Personal consumption, which represents about 70% of all US output, came in below forecasts, signaling Americans aren’t reaching for their wallets like they had been earlier in the pandemic. Growth in business inventories also suggest a more cautious consumer.

The housing market got pummeled. The sector shrank at a 27% annualized pace last quarter as higher mortgage rates put home-buying and construction on ice.

Companies are slowing down their spending. In Q3, business investment grew 6.2%; in Q4, just 0.7%.

Bottom line: The US economy is in a fluid state right now, being tugged in different directions by large, complex forces. Even the people who study it 50 hours a week only speak in probabilities (e.g., “there’s an X% chance Y will happen”). When execs and economists say the outlook is “uncertain”—they mean it.—NF

Big picture: SmarterChild 2.0’s success has educators debating AI’s role in the classroom and how to best assess student learning in the new ChatGPT era.

“If you sue me, I’m not going to let you see Billy Joel live.”

That’s essentially how James Dolan, the CEO of Madison Square Garden Entertainment and billionaire owner of the Knicks, defended <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xc28_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce3e4996c> the company’s controversial use of facial recognition at its venues.

In a rare TV interview yesterday, Dolan claimed that “the Garden has to defend itself,” and threatened to halt alcohol sales at Rangers hockey games to generate negative publicity for regulators. “I don’t need the liquor,” he said.

What’s Dolan so riled up about?

It’s about that—and broader backlash over MSG’s alleged practice of using facial recognition tech to identify and ban lawyers employed at firms involved in MSG-related cases from entering its venues.

New York has launched an investigation into MSG’s use of facial recognition tech, which has impacted 90 law firms, according to NY Attorney General Letitia James.

If it feels like recent US mass attacks have startlingly similar details, it’s because many of them do. A new study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1A_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5e8cb06> from the Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center examined 173 public attacks occurring from 2016 to 2020 and found patterns that repeated from Uvalde, TX, to the back-to-back shootings in California this past weekend.

Some commonalities:

Who: Almost all attackers acted alone and were men. Though attackers ranged in age from 14 to 87, the average age skewed younger at 34.

What: Nearly 73% of attacks involved firearms, and most of those were fatal. The remaining attacks that didn’t involve firearms were mostly nonfatal.

Why: Nearly all attackers experienced a significant stressor, such as a loved one dying, in the five years prior to the attack, and 77% of them experienced one within a year. Half of the incidents were motivated by “perceived wrongs” in the workplace or at home.

The killing of seven people in Half Moon Bay, California, on Monday was described <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfcdcf654> by officials as an act of “workplace violence.”

Most attackers had similar red flags

The study says that nearly half of attackers had a history of misogyny and/or domestic violence—and that those behaviors “deserve increased attention” from law enforcement. Violent online posting and chatting can also signal an individual may commit an attack. The Uvalde, TX, shooter, for example, threatened <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1I_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C49ce0464> women online and shared graphically misogynistic content.

Nearly two-thirds of attackers said or did things so “objectively concerning” that the report says they “should have been met with an immediate response.” Many of these were even reported to law enforcement, employers, and others prior to the mass attack.

The report’s big takeaway? Recognizing shared patterns among past mass attacks early could help prevent future incidents.

Zoom out: Over 39 incidents of mass violence have already occurred in the US this year, and two incidents happened in California just this past week. Legislators are debating what laws they can pass <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cefcd33cf> to slow or stop the momentum.—JW

Ukraine is getting new tanks. Both the US and Germany agreed yesterday to send tanks <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca50bfcf3> to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion—something Ukraine has said it needs to win the war. The US will send 31 M1 Abrams tanks, while Germany will provide 14 Leopard 2 A6 models. Though Western allies have been arming Ukraine since the war began nearly a year ago, there was hesitation over whether sending tanks would be considered an escalation. And while President Biden stressed this move was “not an offensive threat to Russia,” Russia has stated that sending tanks will make the possibility of talks to end the war less likely.

Trump can shop on Facebook Marketplace again.

Meta said Trump’s risk to public safety has “sufficiently receded” since then. Before being banned, Trump was the most followed person on Facebook. It’s not the only social network to welcome him back: Trump’s Twitter account was reinstated in November (though he has yet to post there, sticking to his own competitor, Truth Social…for now).

More than half of all US abortions are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and questions concerning the legality of these abortions have proliferated since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. A separate suit also filed yesterday by a North Carolina doctor challenges that state’s ban, but abortion opponents have their own suit pending in Texas to try to overturn the FDA’s drug approval.

A US-based short seller has set its sights on a Goliath-sized target. The firm, Hindenburg Research, released a 100-page report on Tuesday alleging <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb24_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C61fc2f8e> that the Adani Group, led by the world’s fourth richest person—Gautam Adani—was “pulling the largest con in corporate history.”

According to Hindenburg, Adani Group (one of India’s largest business conglomerates that’s seen as “too big to fail,” given Indian taxpayers’ exposure to it) has run a “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme” for decades, using shell entities to siphon off taxpayer money. Adani Group companies lost $12 billion in market value after the report’s release—something that, if you own a conglomerate, you don’t want to happen.

Adani himself dropped a whole spot on the world’s richest list, falling below Jeff Bezos and just out of the top three.

In response, Adani Group dismissed the allegations and accused Hindenburg of timing the report’s release in bad faith to undermine an upcoming stock sale.

What's at stake: This report makes Adani Group the largest target of Hindenburg Research, and it’s a test of the firm’s power. Hindenburg was relatively unknown until 2020, when its report on then-hot EV maker Nikola became a pillar in the government’s fraud case against the company’s founder.—MK

A $1.5 million Tennessee mansion went viral this week…despite its Zillow listing using a photo of it literally on fire. And in case you were wondering if buying homes is still hard: It’s already under contract <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb3M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb60f11d1>.

The hopeful buyer, Mike Thakur, plans to vlog his restoration process, riding the property’s wave of internet virality and milking that charred house for as much content as possible.

The burnt home…sits on almost five acres of land in Franklin, TN, and includes a bunch of grand staircases, an outdoor kitchen, and a detached guesthouse—where Thakur and his family will live while they fix up the main manor. The house had a fire in September that caused significant damage, but in 2020 (pre-fire) it sold for $10 million, according to a press release from Newswires.

We don’t know how much the self-described content creator/serial entrepreneur is paying for the house, but it was only listed last Tuesday and had a lot of interest from potential buyers, according to the realtors.

Big picture: There’s also growing interest in non-burned down homes. Redfin data found that pending house sales in the US rose 3% last month, the first increase since October 2021. After a tumultuous year, housing demand seems to be rising slowly from the ashes.—MM

Stat: Corporate America may not be fully on board with pay transparency just yet (or maybe there are just a ton of jobs available right now in the $90,000 to $900,000 range), but the newest entrants to the workforce aren’t keen to put on real pants for multiple rounds of interviews only to discover the job pays less than their teenage babysitting gig.

Good morning. Today is National Compliment Day, which…isn’t a real holiday, but it is an excuse to say something nice to someone today.

But not all compliments are created equal. While procrastinating writing the newsletter, we discussed the best types of compliments you can get. A few we came up with:

When someone asks for your recipe at the potluck

When a high school friend’s parents remember your name (or pretty close)

“I see you've been flossing!”—your dentist

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list. Reply with the compliments that give you an especially potent dopamine high.

The corporate podcasting boom may be ending, not with a too-long preamble before the guest, but a whimper. Spotify announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30336596.3021342/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xaFU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMzNjU5Ni4zMDIxMzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce18f8052> yesterday that it will lay off about 600 employees, or 6% of its workforce, in the latest Big Tech recession hedge. The shakeup could signal a pivot in the company’s podcast strategy.

Like most of the other major tech companies making cuts, Spotify cited overly ambitious pandemic growth as the primary cause, and CEO Daniel Ek took “full accountability” for the move. Along with the layoffs, Ek announced a major departure from the audio streamer: Chief Content Officer Dawn Ostroff, who was the driving force behind the company’s $1+ billion podcasting arms race to sign deals with companies like Gimlet and high-profile talent like Barack and Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Joe Rogan.

Although the layoffs don’t specifically target Spotify’s podcasting staff, the departure of Ostroff is yet another sign that the company is slowing down its full-steam-ahead approach to the space. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported the company froze its US budget for new podcasts. The company also didn’t re-up its exclusive deal with Brené Brown, and back in October it pulled 11 originals from the platform.

Overzealous for pods

The tech industry megadeals of the pandemic may have been premature—podcasting made up just 7% of total listening on Spotify in Q1 2022, the company said, despite the massive investment in tentpole shows. And the exclusive show model that makes popular shows available only to subscribers of a given streamer hasn’t proven wildly successful—the Gimlet and Parcast unions announced that making certain shows Spotify exclusives reduced their listenership by, in some instances, as much as 75%.

First, a quick lesson.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) own real estate properties that generate income, equity, or both. There are public and private REITs, which trade on and off the stock market.

And there are public, non-traded REITs. These aren’t traded on the stock market, but are SEC-qualified and regulated to give investors more transparency.

As with the flu, a group of experts would meet yearly to determine which variants should be targeted, and then a once-a-year shot would be made available to the public. The agency is mulling the shift at a moment when only 15% of Americans who are eligible for the most recent Covid booster shot have gotten one. On Thursday an FDA committee will vote on whether to recommend the plan.

Alex Murdaugh, a prominent lawyer and the scion of an important South Carolina legal dynasty, is accused of murdering his wife and son. The trial is happening in Walterboro, SC, a small city located in the jurisdiction where three generations of Murdaughs had served as prosecuting attorneys.

Murdaugh’s alleged crime resume

In 2021 Murdaugh’s wife and son were shot and killed at the family’s hunting property, and a year later prosecutors charged him with the crime. They contend he committed the double murder to win sympathy and divert attention from his shady financial dealings and the legal troubles from a fatal boating accident involving his son. Murdaugh maintains his innocence.

In total, there are more than 100 indictments against Alex Murdaugh. In addition to the alleged murders, he had also been accused of a litany of financial crimes, including:

A multimillion-dollar fraud scheme that siphoned money from his family law firm and its clients

Diverting of funds from the estate of his housekeeper who died at his home from a “trip and fall accident”

Insurance fraud related to an alleged attempt to have his cousin murder him so his older son, Buster, could claim a $10 million life insurance payout

Looking forward: Murdaugh faces life behind bars if convicted of the murder charges.—SK

Layoffs are hitting the confectionary industry: M&Ms announced yesterday that it’s sending its colorful cast of candy characters into “indefinite <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30336596.3021342/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xaTU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMzNjU5Ni4zMDIxMzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2db69529>” retirement.

It appears these characters became too much of a PR headache for the company over criticism that they had lost their sex appeal.

The backstory: Last year, M&M’s began to make changes to its candy spokespeople to be more “representative of the customer” and to keep up with cultural trends—for instance, by replacing the green M&M’s high heels with sneakers.

To some right-wing commentators, these changes reflected the “woke” movement’s hijacking of American culture. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been the most vocal critic of the M&M’s makeover, saying on his show last January that “M&M’s will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous. Until the moment you wouldn’t want to have a drink with any one of them.”

In its statement, a defeated-sounding M&Ms acknowledged “even a candy’s shoes can be polarizing.” It said it will replace its spokescandies with former SNL star Maya Rudolph.—NF

The attack <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C363214bf> occurred as thousands celebrated Lunar New Year’s Eve in this majority Asian American city just east of Los Angeles.

Yesterday, police found <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZUQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3bf64ca0> the suspected gunman, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a white van in Torrance, a city about 30 miles from Monterey Park.

That van fit the description of a vehicle used in another attempted shooting Saturday night in the city of Alhambra, when people at a dance hall disarmed a gun-carrying man before he fled the scene. Officials believe there is a connection between the shooting in Monterey Park and the thwarted incident in Alhambra, but have not yet discovered a motive.

It is the deadliest mass shooting in the US since 21 people were killed at a school in Uvalde, TX, last May, and the 33rd mass shooting so far this year.

“The first suburban Chinatown”

Monterey Park was the first city in the continental US to have a majority of residents with Asian ancestry: Of its current 60,000 residents, 65% are of Asian descent, and they’ve established Monterey Park as a hub of Chinese culture in the San Gabriel Valley. The city is dotted with Asian American restaurants and grocery stores, and Chinese films are frequently screened there, per the AP.

Monterey Park, decked out with red lanterns, had been looking forward to hosting its Lunar New Year fair this weekend after Covid canceled it in the last two years. Historically drawing crowds of more than 100,000 people, its Lunar New Year celebration is one of the largest free street fairs in Southern California. The second day of festivities, which was set for Sunday, was canceled following the attack (though authorities said there was no connection between the two).

Big picture: The Asian American community was approaching this Lunar New Year’s celebration with both an eagerness to gather IRL again, but also trepidation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZTg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4adfd0c9> over the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. Advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said in a statement that this attack, “on one of the most important days of the year for many Asian Americans…is sending shockwaves through our community.”

On the Sunday talk shows, both Democrats and Republicans said they were concerned about these and other findings of classified docs that have dripped out in the past few weeks. Biden said he has “no regrets” about his handling of the situation, and his team and other Dems have tried to emphasize how Biden has cooperated with authorities in their investigation.

It’s James Cameron’s world; we’re just swimming in it.

The director’s film, Avatar: The Way of Water, topped $2 billion <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZWY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cee3e9352> at the box office this weekend, becoming just the sixth movie in history to reach the milestone. Cameron is responsible for three of those six—Avatar, Titanic, and Avatar 2 (the others are Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Avengers: Infinity War).

It will be just a matter of days until Avatar 2 climbs from No. 6 on the list to No. 4, leaping over Infinity War ($2.04 billion) and The Force Awakens ($2.07 billion) as it heads into its seventh week in theaters.

When that happens, the movie could earn another accolade: being profitable. Before the release of the uber-costly Avatar 2, Cameron said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZWc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6a6f0efb> it was the “worst business case in movie history” and would need to become the third- or fourth-highest grossing film of all time to break even.

Zoom out: James Cameron is the movie theater equivalent of Shohei Ohtani—a superstar playing on a sorry team. Cinemas are not in a good place right now: Last week, Regal (whose parent company went bankrupt) said it was closing 39 locations in the US, and AMC has lost all of its meme-stock juice.

Good news for them, though, is that ol’ reliable Cameron plans to release three more Avatar installments in the next five years.

Good morning. We did it, folks—we made it through the darkest timeline. The sun will set at 5pm in New York City tonight, and the next pre-5pm sunset won’t be until November 6. It’s basically pool weather.

Across the United States, tens of thousands of tech workers are waking up to the longest weekend of their professional lives.

Google parent company Alphabet became the latest tech giant to conduct mass layoffs <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C378dd98e>, beginning to let go of 12,000 employees (~6% of its workforce) yesterday morning. And while layoffs have been hitting tech for months now, this week felt particularly painful: Three of the biggest tech companies in the world—Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon—all announced job cuts that affected 40,000 employees combined.

That brings total layoffs in the tech industry to more than 200,000 <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3a13fbc9> over the last year, the FT notes.

That’s a huge number

But it only underscores Big Tech’s breathtaking hiring spree during the pandemic. Believe it or not, most Big Tech workforces are up—way up—since the beginning of Covid. Let’s take a look at the numbers:

Microsoft hired 40,000 people from June 2021 to June 2022. So after the recent layoffs, it’s still up 30,000 employees (or more than one Visa) in 18 months.

Alphabet’s 12,000 layoffs represent ~33% of the 36,751 staff it hired in the single year to September 2022.

Meta hired more than 26,000 employees in 2020 and 2021; it recently cut 11,000 jobs.

So what’s going on? Big Tech companies feasted during the Covid boom times, believing they’d never get heartburn later on. Now, facing a deteriorating economic environment, they’re letting go of some “moonshot” ideas, promoting efficiency <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf4fa9dc9>, and being more surgical about their investments (like in AI).

Finally, there’s one elephant in the room: Apple. Maybe it got lost while using Apple Maps, but the iPhone maker remains the only Big Tech company that hasn’t yet announced layoffs. One factor, CNBC suggests <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc134002b>, could be that it hired far more methodically than its peers during the pandemic. Apple increased its headcount by just 6.5% in the year to September 2022—about the same growth rate it’s had since 2016.—NF

Ukraine’s hopes of getting German tanks have tanked (for now). Its allies met in Germany yesterday and agreed to send more weapons aid to the country, but failed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZGc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8e7aa5e1> to reach an agreement on supplying tanks.

Why are tanks still a big deal in the age of drones?

Drones and surface-to-air missile systems may be more modern, but Ukraine says it’s got to have the good ol’ armored beasts to mount a counteroffensive against Russia.

The armored vehicles equipped with heavy guns are the go-to when breaking enemy lines in a ground offensive.

Both sides are preparing for a major forward push in the spring, and state-of-the art tanks would be ideal for the flatlands in the east of the country, where much of the anticipated combat will likely take place.

Ukraine is currently fighting with Soviet- and Russian-made tanks, but they are not the next-gen machines its war effort requires. The UK recently agreed to supply 14 heavy-duty tanks, but Ukraine says it needs 300 of them.

Zoom out: While the tank situation remains uncertain, Ukraine’s allies consented to send it an assortment of weapons including air-defense systems, rockets, and artillery rounds. The US is planning a $2.5 billion arms shipment that for the first time includes the powerful Stryker armored combat vehicles.—SK

Space is yet again throwing a once-in-a-lifetime viewing experience at us.

What makes it green? The comet, nicknamed ZTF, is similar to other giant hurtling balls of dust and frozen gas, but produces a unique glowing green light. How? The sun’s ultraviolet radiation hits the diatomic carbon in the comet (which is actually just two carbon atoms fused together) and…we would go more into that, but this isn’t Space Brew.

Scientists first spotted ZTF last March, and now it’s your turn: For northern hemisphere residents, your best bet is to look north this weekend, either late in the evening or early in the morning in a place with little light pollution. The comet will be close to the Draco constellation starting tonight. You have until about early February when ZTF heads to the southern hemisphere.

Besides just looking cool…Astronomers will study the rare comet over the next month to hopefully get a better glimpse of the phenomenon that may have helped create life on earth, before it leaves our solar system.

Prosecutors announced yesterday that actor Alec Baldwin and Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN04_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5f2b503b> for the on-set shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza in 2021.

The charge, filed in New Mexico, is a fourth-degree felony, which means that Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed could face up to 18 months behind bars and a $5,000 fine. But prosecutors also tacked on a provision that could result in five years of prison time because a gun was involved.

Baldwin’s attorney responded, “This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice…we will fight these charges, and we will win.” Baldwin also sued crew members including Gutierrez-Reed and Rust assistant director David Halls in November, alleging they were negligent in handing him the gun.

How we got here

During a rehearsal for the movie Rust in October 2021, Baldwin’s gun—which was pointed at Hutchins—fired live ammunition and killed her. Baldwin has repeatedly denied pulling the trigger, saying that he had started to cock the gun and released the hammer. Gun experts have been hesitant to support Baldwin’s claim, arguing that would be essentially impossible.

So, how did this happen? Investigators for the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Department haven’t released information on how live ammunition ended up on a film set, but a separate investigation by the state’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau found that firearm procedures on the set were lax. The agency fined Rust’s production company the maximum amount ($137,000) for not following proper safety precautions.

The report also uncovered <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN08_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C33b69e37> emails and texts that producers sent to Gutierrez-Reed urging her to spend less time on her gun-handling and training tasks to make time for her other props duties.

Two firearm misfires five days before the fatal shooting went ignored by Rust management, per the report.

Big picture: The tragedy on the Rust set renewed long-standing safety concerns in the film industry over fatal prop gun mishaps on sets, as well as the minimal training required to become a firearms specialist for film and TV.—MM

Many workers also went on strike, resulting in the closing of schools and the cancellation of transit routes and flights. But the battle over the retirement age is just getting started, as major French unions announced a second day of strikes on January 31. Macron says lifting the retirement age is necessary to keep the country’s pension fund from drying up.

What does that actually mean? These measures are a series of deep-cut accounting moves <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN1k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C24f23c7f> that allow the Treasury to continue making its payments. They include:

Suspending reinvestments into government funds for retired federal employees, such as the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

Selling existing investments in those funds to free up more outstanding debt.

And while these measures definitely aren’t ordinary…they probably aren’t so “extra,” either. The Treasury has resorted to them more than 12 times since 1985, including during the last debt-ceiling standoff in 2021.

Still, these steps amount to chugging water after eating a ghost pepper—the pain will return. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her extraordinary measures will last through early June, giving lawmakers about five months to work out a deal to raise the debt ceiling.

Big picture: The US has never defaulted on its debt, but even the threat of it could be disastrous. The country’s first credit downgrade in history came during a debt-ceiling showdown in 2011.—NF

With the sheepish energy of someone requesting a refund from the Girl Scouts because their Thin Mints box is dented, Amazon on Wednesday announced that it will shutter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xODE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfc26854b> its charitable donation program, AmazonSmile, by Feb. 20.

AmazonSmile was launched in 2013 and donated 0.5% of eligible purchases to a charity of a customer’s choice. As of the end of December, the program had doled out about $449 million to a wide variety of charities over its existence. Still, Amazon claims AmazonSmile hasn’t been as impactful as it originally hoped. The sheer number of charities in the program (1+ million globally) spread its donations too thin, the company wrote in an email to customers.

The move is yet another entry in a string of measures the tech giant has taken in recent weeks to cut costs after a pandemic hiring spree doubled its global workforce to over 1.6 million.

Those other cost cuts: Amazon announced this month that it would lay off more than 18,000 workers in what likely is the largest workforce reduction in the company’s history. Amazon has also called it quits on riskier business ventures like its telehealth service and a video chat projector for kids.—MK

And they’re among the best in the NBA—two international players (Serbia’s Nikola Jokić and Greece’s Giannis Antetokounmpo) won the last four MVP awards.

ANSWER

13112221. This is a pretty diabolical set of integers known as the “Look-and-say sequence <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xOGs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C192debf5>.” To get the next number in the sequence, you read off the digits of the previous item.

For instance, “1” is “one one” so the next item is “11.” From that comes “two ones,” so you write down “21” and so on. So, to get the next term in the sequence above, it would be “one three, one one, two twos, two ones.”

Good morning. The countdown to economic catastrophe has officially begun . The US will hit its debt ceiling today, though Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she’ll implement “extraordinary measures” that will keep the government from defaulting on its debt until probably early June.

Still, June isn’t that far away, and Congress needs to work out a deal pronto to raise the government’s borrowing cap and avert almost assured economic turmoil and market chaos.

What were we saying again? Oh yeah, good morning.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP

The pandemic’s entrepreneurial boom isn’t over yet <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2De36b5957> Mark Cuban on Shark Tank <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ee36b5957> Shark Tank/ABC Network via Giphy
At the rate Americans are creating new businesses, Shark Tank is going to need to increase its episode count by about 4,000 to keep up with demand. More than 5 million new business applications were filed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2s_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7844788f> in 2022, according to new data from the US Census Bureau.

About 14,000 new business applications were filed in the US every day last year—although it’s still too soon to know how many of those aspiring Scrub Daddies will actually make it off the ground.

Whether this represents a testament to the country’s entrepreneurial spirit, an indictment of 9-to-5s, or simply a case of everyone seeing the same TikTok about the tax benefits of forming an LLC, it’s a sign that the pandemic-era startup boom may be here to stay.

And it was quite a boom

Despite the vast number of Steve Jobs biopics that were being created, the US was actually experiencing a 40-year decline in entrepreneurship before the pandemic, per the NYT. But then things changed: The number of new businesses created in 2020 increased by 24% from 2019 to 4.3 million as laid-off workers found their savings accounts boosted by stimulus payments and a bull market. Also helpful: rock-bottom interest rates.

The trend continued in 2021, ballooning to 5.4 million applications.

And now we know that the swell continued into 2022. But some areas saw more growth than others. The Southern US has had a 53% increase in new businesses since 2019, with the most growth coming from Florida and Texas, per Bloomberg analysis. New England, on the other hand, is falling below the national average.

Looking ahead…we’ll have to wait and see if these businesses thrive and the trend continues in 2023. A looming potential recession, high inflation, and personal savings dropping to near 60-year lows (per the Bureau of Economic Analysis) all signal turbulence ahead for new companies, which already have a roughly 50% failure rate during good economic times.—MK

These are just the latest tech company layoffs, many of which have begun thinning their ranks after rapidly expanding during the pandemic now that they’re facing rising interest rates, smaller digital ad budgets, and less consumer spending. According to the tracker Layoffs.fyi, the sector shed more than 154,000 jobs in 2022 and has already cut around ~37,500 this year.

Not even the powerhouse of dresses with weird cutouts has been spared by investors’ newfound skepticism toward exorbitant tech company valuations. Shein, the fast-fashion retailer that bills itself as a tech firm, is looking to raise <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM3M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca1b574c9> $3 billion more from its existing investors at a $64 billion valuation—a sharp drop from the $100 billion valuation the company had in April, according to the Financial Times.

Fast rise: Shein grew rapidly in the last few years, and was considered a no-brainer investment for backers flush with cash.

Fast fall: Now, after spending years throwing billions at any tech company whose slide deck had the word “disruptor” in it, VCs are getting stingy as interest rates rise and the global economy slows down. So, Shein (along with a lot of other companies) is stuck entering a “down round”—i.e., being forced to raise funds at a much lower valuation, the FT reported, though the company told the FT it “denied the accuracy” of some of the report.

The University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest public universities in the nation, banned <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9faD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb8084d01> TikTok from its wi-fi and across its wired networks yesterday—and not because someone made a call-out video of Bevo’s Shein haul.

The university is complying with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s recent decision to forbid state employees from having the app on government-issued devices. And it’s just the latest major US campus to confine its students to Instagram Reels: Public universities in at least five states, including Auburn University in Alabama, the University of Montana, and schools in the University System of Georgia, have banned the app.

The backstory: In the last few months, more than half of US states have barred TikTok from government devices, according to CNN. Government officials all the way up to President Biden—who last month signed legislation that included a TikTok ban for federal devices—are on edge about the national security and privacy concerns around the app, which is owned by China’s ByteDance. In the past year, ByteDance has admitted to tracking journalists who cover it, and accessing US TikTok user data from China.

These college bans will mostly be...annoying

When you tell a college student not to do something, they’re probably going to find a way to do it. Tech-savvy undergrads are skirting the bans by using their own data or personal wi-fi to access one of their favorite social media platforms.

Still, the bans are causing uncertainty, and everyone from communications professors to the people running university mascot accounts are wondering how these restrictions will affect their work. Think of the college improv teams trying to Impractical Jokers people, or the sorority rush chairs who use the app to hype recruitment.

But it goes beyond depleting DG’s follower count: Some critics also argue that banning TikTok on university wi-fi hinders <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9faT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C957bbe04> professors’ abilities to better understand the app and how it spreads the misinformation politicians are so concerned about.

Bottom line: It’s unlikely that most students at UT-Austin, Auburn, or any other school that decides to ban TikTok in the future will ditch the app. According to Pew, 67% of 13- to 17-year-olds have used the platform, making it the second most popular app behind YouTube.—MM

Protesters had been trying to defend the town, called Lützerath, for years, turning it into a symbol of government hypocrisy on climate change. But the energy crisis spurred by the war in Ukraine and Germany’s desperate search for more energy sources, lent new urgency to the coal mine’s expansion. Last week, hundreds of protesters who had been living in Lützerath were cleared out by police.

The last time this happened was in 1959–1961, when the abysmal Great Leap Forward economic initiative caused widespread famines.

Though it occurred sooner than demographers predicted, the current decline isn’t shocking—China's birthrate has been dropping for years, reaching a record low in modern history in 2022. Observers blame the high cost of parenthood, strict COVID lockdowns, and decades of the restrictive one-child rule. As a result of the country’s aging population, funerals outnumbered baby showers by about 850,000 last year.

Everyone–not just China–should be worried

An aging population usually creates a noxious economic cocktail of less working-age people available to fill jobs and more retirees requiring costly care. This can slow economic growth (any gains in the daytime television industry notwithstanding), which for various reasons <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9fcT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1f0970ad> in China was already at a multi-decade low of just 3% last year.

If things go south for the world’s second-largest economy, the rest of the world would feel it, too. Fewer workers in the exporting powerhouse of China could mean more expensive products for consumers globally, as well as reduced demand for goods and services that the country sources from abroad.

Zoom out: Some experts are staying optimistic about China’s future, pointing to its ongoing embrace of less labor-intensive industries like semiconductors and finance, while manufacturing shifts to countries with more abundant workers.—SK

Sales of canned seafood shot up by 10% (to $2.7 billion) in the US in 2022, according to Euromonitor International. The primary driver? TikToks in which aesthetic, photogenic tinned fish boards are prepared as part of a romantic date night charcuterie.

While some users claim the trend is “giving Great Depression,” it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Over the course of last year, users on the app posted their #tinnedfish dinners—some claiming to do this every week—and the hashtag now has more than 26 million views.

Companies are jumping aboard the cannedwagon, utilizing vintage design styles in packaging and developing new strategies, like selling pairing kits, to move fish. Scout Canning, a popular Vancouver-based brand, told the WSJ that its revenues jumped 82% in 2022.

Could be nice for Earth, too: Tinned fish’s long shelf life, lack of refrigeration requirements, and recyclable packaging make for a more climate-friendly protein than many other meats.—MK

ANSWER

A writing tip you can keep in your pocket (if it’s not already there) is that adverbs ending in -ly should not be hyphenated. Here “softly-enforced” should become “softly enforced.”

If Bernard Arnault had more than one daughter, this sentence would be correct. But he only has one, so “Delphine Arnault” should be offset by commas.

Here is a classic case of a misplaced modifier, as it sounds like the early days won a narrow majority in the House. The fix we went with: “With a narrow majority in the House, the GOP needs to optimize…”

The problem here is homonyms. We meant “defused,” which means to make less tense. “Diffused” means spreading out.

The ongoing tug of war between remote employees (who are feeling more productive and less burnt out) and their employers (who are feeling bad about paying for an office) could experience a balance shift in 2023. Major companies, aware of fears about a potential recession, are issuing directives <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XaT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C85e847b2> to come into the office for more days, sometimes under the threat of termination.

Last week, Disney CEO Bob Iger told hybrid staff that, starting on March 1, they must return to the office four days a week. Two days later, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced a similar three-day RTO requirement, expressing irritation at internal badge swipe data that revealed employees were not “meeting their minimum promise” regarding hybrid work.

Employees at Vanguard, Paycom, and News Corp have also received recent orders to phase out remote work in the new year. A survey from Resume Builder found that 90% of companies will require a return to the office this year, signaling a shift away from the softly enforced hybrid policies that became popular during the pandemic.

A controversial resolution

That doesn’t mean employees are excited to add commute time or “getting asked about weekend plans” back into their lives: According to a recent Gallup poll, 34% of remote-capable workers want to work from home permanently and just 3% want to work in the office full time. A Monster survey in September found that 40% of workers would quit if they had to come into the office even one day a week.

But there’s an issue with that: Remote work is getting hard to find. Between February and October 2022, remote job listings fell from 20% to 14% of all listings on LinkedIn. Now, even more employers seem empowered to demand <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XTT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C22719f95> in-office time.

Messina Denaro, who once bragged that you could “fill a cemetery” with his victims, is allegedly the head of the Cosa Nostra syndicate. Despite dodging authorities since 1993, he has been convicted in absentia and given life sentences for his role in various crimes, including the murder of two anti-Mafia prosecutors; bombings in Florence, Milan, and Rome that killed 10; and the slaying of the young son of a Mafioso who turned state’s witness.

Elon Musk heads to court over Tesla tweet.

In it, Musk (who never met a 4/20 reference he didn’t like) said he had secured funding to take Tesla private for $420 per share, and investors are suing Musk and Tesla since the deal never happened. So far, Musk is expected to testify this week, and his odds don’t look great: The judge already determined that the tweet was false and reckless, but now a jury will weigh whether Musk knew it was false and whether it was material to investors.

Art made by AI has won prizes, been displayed in museums, and taken over Twitter profile pics, but not everyone’s happy with how it turns users into elven princesses.

Three artists are suing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XcT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd1904dd4> Midjourney, Stability AI, and DeviantArt for their use of an AI art-generating tool called Stable Diffusion. The artists—Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz—allege the tool violates millions of artists’ copyrights.

How AI art generators work: Stable Diffusion has been fed billions of images scraped from the web in order to train its AI on how to do things like identify an “avocado.” So when a user types “corgi eats an avocado in space” into an AI art generator that uses Stable Diffusion, it creates new works <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Xcj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca06ef6f9> based on the images it’s analyzed.

But whether it’s derivative or plagiarism is up for debate

The suit claims that Stable Diffusion cobbles together pieces of copyrighted images, but creators of AI art-generating tools argue that their use of existing pictures to train the AI to make new ones is covered by “fair use” doctrine—which allows using copyrighted materials for “transformative” purposes.

Bottom line: This case could set an important precedent on training AI tools that could go way beyond the art world.—JW

Watch out, Zeus: Scientists haven’t completely mastered lightning, but they’ve successfully used a laser to divert its direction. A study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Xdz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce57548a5> published yesterday described an experiment in which a laser was shot at a storm cloud from atop a Swiss mountain to successfully direct lightning toward the ground.

This marks the first time the method worked outside a lab, and that’s a big step forward for public safety.

Lightning causes billions of dollars in damage and claims over 4,000 lives a year.

It would be much worse had Benjamin Franklin not invented the lightning rod, which to this day remains the go-to for protection from lightning. But the man would have turned 317 today, so it’s about time his invention was updated—especially since the Franklin rod is a godsend for your home, but it’s insufficient for bigger places like airports or wind farms.

So, how did we one-up a founding father?

Scientists unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of laser pulses at thunderclouds, creating a path of charged particles that lightning was more likely to follow. Four lightning bolts were steered toward a rod mounted on top of a telecom tower that is a frequent target of lightning strikes.

Looking forward: It’ll be a while before you’ll be able to catch regular laser-lightning shows in the night sky due to an eye-popping price tag: The system used in the experiment costs $2.17 billion.—SK

Good morning. Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Not only is it a federal holiday to honor the legacy of Dr. King, but it’s also the only federal holiday to be designated as a National Day of Service. So let this be a nudge to roll up your sleeves and get active in your local community—you can make a positive difference.

As more students realize that ChatGPT can write five-paragraph essays equally as good as—if not significantly better than—what they’re capable of, teachers are scrambling for tools that can detect whether they’re grading the writing of a young human or a young robot.

Several cheating-detection tools have sprung up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VWT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2d3c7817> in the few months since ChatGPT, a conversational language model from OpenAI, arrived on the scene. The most-talked about one is GPTZero <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VWj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cea1ab833>, which was developed by, of all people…a student.

Over winter break, 22-year-old Princeton student Edward Tian created an app that determines the likelihood that a piece of text was written by a human or by ChatGPT. While it probably didn’t make him the most popular dude on campus, the app is getting more than 7 million views as of last week.

Apps like GPTZero are becoming increasingly sought after as older cheating detection tools become obsolete in the ChatGPT era.

Remember Turnitin?

Many of us who’ve been tasked with explaining the green light at the end of The Great Gatsby have had to submit those essays to Turnitin.com to make sure we didn’t copy it from Wikipedia. That was effective…before ChatGPT. But what makes ChatGPT different is that it theoretically creates an original response of text every time you query it. That’s not what Turnitin is designed for: It cross-checks your work against an existing database of writing.

Turnitin, of course, is on the case: It says it’s currently testing a tool that can detect AI-generated text, and plans to open it up to the public later this year.

But as good as these apps get, ChatGPT and its fellow language models will also evolve—and some education experts say teachers will have to also rely on the oldest tool in the book to mitigate cheating: their noggin. Teachers will need to understand the differences (which do exist) between AI and human writing.

On Friday, Boston city officials unveiled <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9WNj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd088ab19> the latest monument to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—a $10 million bronze sculpture depicting the moment MLK embraced his wife, Coretta Scott King, after Dr. King learned he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It is called The Embrace.

The completion of the 22-foot-tall statue was highly anticipated: Five years in the works, it is the largest monument to racial equity in the country, and it’s located in the Boston Common, the oldest public park in the US.

Why Boston? That was where MLK met Coretta: He was a doctoral student at BU, while she was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. Boston Common was also the final destination of a 20,000-person-strong voting rights march Dr. King led from Roxbury in 1955.

But The Embrace hasn’t exactly been embraced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9WNz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C23e86aaa> from a critical POV. The design of the statue, which shows four arms intertwined, was bashed online for not depicting the couple in full and for potentially giving off inappropriate vibes. Corretta Scott King’s cousin, Seneca Scott, wrote in the online journal Compact, “Ten million dollars were wasted to create a masturbatory metal homage to my legendary family members.”

Cancer prevention is working. Overall mortality from cancer <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9QWj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3ec60548> has plunged by a third since 1991, according to a new report by the American Cancer Society. The drop, which the organization estimates has resulted in 3.8 million cancer deaths avoided, reflects improvements to cancer screening and prevention. For instance, cervical cancer rates for women in their early twenties dropped 65% following the introduction of the HPV vaccine. But there’s still more work to do: Rates of prostate cancer, which is the second largest cause of cancer death for US men, have started climbing and cases are frequently being caught in later stages.

But this one’s probably not a candidate to be our new digs if Elon Musk’s plans for Mars don’t pan out—the planet, named LHS 475 b, orbits a red dwarf star a whole lot closer than we do the sun, making it at least 200 degrees hotter than Earth. Still, the newbie adds to the list of 5,000+ exoplanets NASA has found so far.

They’ll both speak at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting in Davos this week, as economic and political elites from around the globe gather in the Swiss Alps to drink Glühwein in a ski lodge brainstorm solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.

According to the WEF <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C42260562>, these are: climate change, inflation, confrontation between countries, threats from technology, plus the prospect of these issues combining into a “polycrisis” (like wars over scarce natural resources brought about by climate change).

What happens in Davos every year is pretty straightforward: World leaders, billionaires, heads of international NGOs, celebrities, and Nobel laureates rub elbows behind closed doors. Meanwhile, journalists lurk around, hoping to catch them in a talkative mood.

But does the WEF really achieve anything besides organizing a glitzy get-together in Europe’s highest town?

First, what is the WEF?

It’s a not-for-profit foundation that’s been around since 1971. It aims to bring together the world’s most influential people to “shape global, regional, and industry agendas.” Aside from the flagship Davos event, it runs regional summits and publishes thought leadership on economic and social issues.

The WEF’s efforts center on stakeholder capitalism, the idea that corporations should not just be profit-maximizing machines but should also look out for customers, suppliers, and local communities.

Not everyone is a fan of the Alpine ski squad

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that an organization in the business of setting up schmooze fests for the global elite has more than a few critics.

Davos skeptics note that the WEF is funded by basically every major organization under the sun. Its 2022 annual report says over half of the ~$413 million it brought in that year came from its partners, mostly corporations like Nestlé and government-run entities like the Agricultural Bank of China. It’s been accused of engaging in capitalist virtue signaling while making it easier for sponsors to lobby for their interests and advocate for business-friendly policies.

The “Great Reset” initiative, the foundation’s global post-pandemic recovery plan, has been panned as a thinly veiled effort to tip the power balance in solving global issues away from governments and toward the private sector.

Why this all matters to those without a private jet

The WEF shapes the conversation (and policies) in areas like international food security and global vaccine distribution:

* It’s a prominent supplier of narratives to news organizations, with last year’s Davos meeting getting 48,000 media mentions (and it’s already notched at least one this year).

* Its influence transcends legacy media: Popular journalist Johnny Harris was once called out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C972d107f> for partnering with the WEF to promote shareholder capitalism on his YouTube channel.

Big picture: Curiously enough, this year’s Davos attendees nearly showed up to a ski resort without the ability to ski, as an unusually warm winter has left European mountains with little snow. It did snow in Davos at the last minute, but whether the WEF’s efforts can help blunt the impacts of climate change (or solve any other problems) remains to be seen. The WEF’s ability to produce vague proclamations and viral Greta Thunberg moments <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf1ac448c>, however, is certainly beyond question.—SK

While it may not be Australia’s largest city, Melbourne is the country’s hub for all things food, culture, arts, and sports—and starting tomorrow it’ll be the center of the tennis universe for the next two weeks when it hosts the Australian Open.

As you watch tennis players rally in the warm sun (it is summer Down Under, after all), you should know that outside the courts, there’s a metropolis of 5+ million people with some unique characteristics, starting with the city’s design. Melbourne’s central business district (CBD) is laid out in a grid, but tucked behind the major thoroughfares are “laneways” that in the Victorian era serviced the businesses on the main roads. It’s on these narrow streets that you can find some of the cafes, boutiques, restaurants, and street art that Melbourne is known for.

Some other fun facts:

* Melbourne is sports-mad. Not only does it host the Australian Open, but also a Formula 1 race and other international events. Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity: 100,000+) is one of the most famous sports venues in the world. And in 1956 Melbourne became the first city outside of Europe or North America to host the Olympics.

* Vegemite, that foul spread Australians like to eat with bread, is manufactured in Melbourne and the product turns 100 years old this year.

* In the 2010s, Melbourne was declared the most livable city in the world for seven straight years by the Economist Intelligence Unit. —NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd Work Last Sunday we asked you to predict what Merriam-Webster will select as its 2023 Word of the Year and why. For reference, this year’s was “gaslighting.”

Our favorite responses:

“In 2023, Merriam-Webster’s Word of the Year will be ‘artificial.’ AI will continue to make us ask questions about content like the ones we’ve been asking about our food: ‘This isn’t butter?’ ‘Yogurt?’ ‘This is meat? IMPOSSIBLE!’ Prince Harry’s Spare will expose the phoniness of the monarchy. Elon Musk will continue to make bots scapegoats. And making daylight saving time permanent will help us all realize how artificial anything can be—even time.”—Luke from Atlanta, GA

“‘Sus,’ because everything is.”—Brandie from Arkansas

“ChatGPT. Why? Because the phrase ‘ChatGPT it’ will replace the phrase ‘Google it’ as the means to obtain unknowns via the internet.”—Heather

“Gaslighting. Because what are you talking about? It was never the 2022 Word of the Year.”—Hanna from San Diego, CA (and a lot more of you jokesters)

This week’s question

Super high-end restaurant Noma announced that it will cease to be a restaurant in 2025. The Copenhagen establishment, ranked among the world’s best, was known to charge $500 for a meal. Design a meal that you would happily pay $500 for.

Here’s Matty’s response to get the creative juices flowing: The theme would be “Midwest Delicacies.” There would be three courses featuring various types of loose beef sandwiches and a fancy strawberry pretzel salad for dessert.

Good morning and Happy Saturday. Our fantastic design team was out at a summit yesterday, which left the inmates (us) to run the asylum (image selection for the newsletter).

When deciding which images to use for each story, Jamie jokingly floated the idea of using Simpsons GIFs for all of them. At first we laughed, but then thought…why the heck not? So, for no particular reason, we did.

Thank you most of all to Matt Groening for providing an infinite library of timeless scenes to choose from.

The sky began to slowly descend on Washington as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen kicked off the fight over the debt ceiling yesterday.

Yellen said that if lawmakers don’t raise the cap on government borrowing, the Treasury will start taking “extraordinary measures,” like pausing contributions to federal workers’ retirement funds, on Thursday.

So, what is all the fuss about? In order for the US to keep borrowing and paying its bills, lawmakers have to agree on a new debt ceiling. Currently the US is $78 billion away from maxing out the current $31.4 trillion limit (similar to your credit card sitch after the holiday season).

This is something Congress needs to do, but lawmakers have come to view the procedure as a bargaining chip. The negotiation is expected to be epic:

Ultraconservative Republicans only handed Rep. Kevin McCarthy the House speakership on the condition that a new borrowing limit gets coupled with deep cuts to government spending and a plan to balance the budget in the next decade. (According to the Washington Post, they’ve already prepared a plan for default.)

The White House insists that the new debt limit must be passed with no strings attached.

While the government can probably scrape by on the cash it has until early June, all the drama has people thinking about what defaulting for real would be like. Well, the reputation of the US as a borrower would start to resemble that of an unemployed uncle with a gambling addiction. Financial markets would likely enter a tailspin and the US economy would tank.

How do we avert the disaster?

Lawmakers have to reach a compromise. It could involve negotiations between top House Republicans and the White House, or the House entering a more protracted procedure that entails convincing moderate Republicans to vote with Democrats.

But if the traditional route doesn’t work, policy nerds have some workarounds (that are not Yellen-approved). One is minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin to meet the Treasury’s financial obligations.

Bottom line: While an unprecedented default on US government debt remains a remote possibility, some parts of the bond market (which holds government debt) are already angsty and preparing for a long congressional fight.—SK

Though bank lending is looking profitable right now thanks to higher interest rates, the institutions said they were socking away more cash than analysts expected to cover loan defaults in preparation for a recession. Both JPMorgan and Bank of America indicated that they anticipate the downturn will be a “mild” one but that they have to prepare for the worst anyway. They’re also probably psyched not to be Goldman Sachs, which hasn’t reported earnings yet but revealed that it lost $3 billion on its attempts to serve consumers since 2020.

Hasbro still plans to revamp the 23-year-old license, which allows smaller publishers and creators to make their own riffs on the game, but it’s backing down from some provisions that drove the pushback, including a royalty agreement, and has delayed the release of the new deal.

Leopard lost and found. The Dallas Zoo was closed yesterday after it discovered that a clouded leopard named Nova was not in her enclosure. Luckily, Nova—who despite sounding fearsome was described by officials as only 30 pounds and no threat to humans—was located near the enclosure hours later, and preliminarily found to be unharmed. Though zoo officials had faith she’d be found close to her home, Dallas police opened an investigation into the potential involvement of a cat burglar after determining that the leopard’s enclosure was intentionally cut rather than torn.

For a revolutionary tech company, Tesla is starting to act a lot like your average car manufacturer. After missing year-end delivery goals, the company slashed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30250159.3068198/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VcD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjUwMTU5LjMwNjgxOTg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cda25b213> its vehicle prices in the US and Europe Thursday.

The details: Tesla fell short getting cars into garages despite pulling out all the stops to move its vehicles in December, including $7,500 discounts and the promise of free charging. And this week it went even further and announced another round of price cuts, some as high as ~20%, to goose sales. The lower pricing also made more versions of its popular Model Y SUV eligible for Biden’s $7,500 EV tax credit.

What does this mean? The company that once bragged about its long waitlist now has too many vehicles sitting around collecting dust. Which isn’t great when you consider the 65% nosedive Tesla’s stock took last year thanks to supply chain problems, skyrocketing interest rates, the EV market becoming more saturated, and Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter ordeal.

Bottom line: Investors are getting nervous. Tesla will report its 2022 Q4 earnings January 25.—MM

National intelligence officials cataloged hundreds of new sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena since last year, according to the unclassified version <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30250159.3068198/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VdT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjUwMTU5LjMwNjgxOTg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C80513ad8> of a government report released Thursday. The report is part of a growing effort by the US government to investigate UFOs as a legit scientific and national security matter—not a conspiracy theory.

Some other nuggets from the report:

Over 366 sightings out of 510 total have been added to the government’s list since last year; more than half have been deemed “unremarkable” and “clutter,” and their self-confidence is now shattered. Many were just balloons and drones.

But 171 are special and have “demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities,” like little Tony Hawks of the sky.

Officials have said, repeatedly, that there’s no reason to suspect Kang and Kodos or any other aliens of operating the UFOs—but they also haven’t ruled it out.

Good morning. It’s once again time to revive the quarterly practice of lighting $50 on fire because the lottery jackpot got high enough to make it seem like a smart idea. After 25 whiffs over three months of drawings, the Mega Millions jackpot has risen to $1.35 billion, which is good for the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in history. The next drawing will be held Friday night.

The FAA created air travel chaos yesterday that highlights outdated tech in aviation again after a key bit of its software glitched harder than a Grand Theft Auto NPC. The agency grounded all flights in the morning over a problem it believes was caused by a “damaged database file,” renewing concerns that US travel infrastructure desperately needs an update.

This grounding is way bigger than when your parents realized the “cartoons” you rented from Blockbuster were hyperviolent anime: It may be the first time all flights have been ordered to stay on the tarmac since 9/11. Departures resumed at 9am ET, but as of yesterday evening, 10,000+ US flights were delayed and 1,300 were canceled as airlines struggled to sort out the morning mayhem <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9FdT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9eb7c460>.

Delays and cancellations could go on for days…meaning this MLK weekend could give deja vu of late December, when Southwest had to cancel thousands of flights after its software couldn’t handle weather conditions disrupting its itineraries.

What exactly caused this mess?

The FAA system that went down was created over 75 years ago. It's called NOTAMs (formerly “Notice to Airmen,” now “Notice to Air Missions”), and it alerts pilots to any hazards along their route and at their destination—such as flocks of birds and icy runways. It was rebooted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Fdj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd36a7e25> yesterday morning after some corrupted data was discovered, and it took longer than AOL dial-up to get back online.

The government system has been criticized for *surprise, surprise* not being very modern, and the UN’s aviation body has been pushing to bring NOTAMs into the 21st century. A single briefing produced by the system can consist of up to 200 pages of alerts, and pilots have to review the whole document before takeoff.

Looking ahead…the FAA has preliminarily traced the issue back to a damaged file and said that it does not appear a cyber attack was involved, but, whatever occurred, the outage signals that the system’s outdatedness may run deeper than its HTML. “America’s transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades,” Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association president, said. He called on <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Fdz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C64dcf877> policymakers to “modernize our vital air travel infrastructure.”—JW

It’s likely to put pressure on other companies during their annual spring pay negotiations, even if most won’t offer such a large increase.

Not satisfied with simply taking Elon Musk’s top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bernard Arnaut is also taking plot lines from HBO. The world’s richest person and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH named his daughter, Delphine Arnault, CEO of the fashion house Dior, setting up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9FRD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C769625df> a sibling battle for succession of his company.

Analysts see the move as a Logan Roy/George Bluth-eseque attempt to pit sibling against sibling, as Arnault’s son Antoine was named CEO of the holding company that controls the family fortune in December.

Luxury goods seem to be a passion for all of Arnault’s five children, as they all work for the company in various executive positions across its brands. Probably safe to assume there’s a Tom Wambsgans analog eating birds under a cloth in the mix, too.

But, like Succession, we may have to wait a few seasons to see how this all shakes out. LVMH recently changed its bylaws to increase the maximum age for a CEO to 80 (from 75)—an apparent sign that the 73-year-old Arnault patriarch isn’t planning on stepping down soon.

Dump your flaxseed and aquafaba: You might be able to afford baking with actual eggs again soon. Egg prices are finally starting to come down after hitting a record-high average of $5.46 per dozen in December.

A lot less chickens were crossing the road last year…On top of high inflation all around, more than 43 million egg-laying hens died last year due to the worst avian flu outbreak in US history (leaving ~375 million total). The death toll was so high partly because if one bird in a farmer’s flock gets infected, the FDA requires all remaining birds to be killed, real zombie apocalypse stuff.

Instead, South Korea’s Samsung got the most, while IBM came in at No. 2. But the company was quick to explain that it totally meant to drop off the top of the list after three decades of dominance, having made the decision back in 2020 to focus on collaboration over exclusivity to get the quantum computing industry off the ground.

The two go-getters can’t fetch anyone coffee, but they have already named themselves Aiko and Aiden and created their own uncanny valley-dwelling self-portraits.

A deadly barrage of storms has been dumping Olympic-sized pools of rain on California over the past few weeks. On Monday, millions across the state experienced an “atmospheric river” that dropped a month’s worth of rain in one day. And as the downpours continued yesterday, 90% of the state’s population (which equates to 10% of the entire US population) was under flood watch. Forecasters estimate more than 20 trillion gallons <Over%2020%20trillion%20gallons%20of%20water%20are%20expected%20to%20fall%20across%20California%20over%20the%20next%202%20weeks.%20> of water will have fallen on California by mid-January.

Surely all this water will cure the state of the devastating drought that’s parched it over the last few decades, right?

Not quite

In fact, most parts of California are simultaneously under drought and flood emergencies, a bizarre consequence of climate change that will likely stick around—despite more rainstorms projected to hit the state throughout the rest of the month.

Experts say California would need a lot more rain to completely reverse the drought that has put the Southwest in its driest condition in 1,200 years. One scientist told <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25hdGlvbi8yMDIzLzAxLzA1L2NhbGlmb3JuaWEtZHJvdWdodC1yYWluLXN0b3JtLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C18ef35f3> the WaPo that these storms are like getting a normal monthly paycheck after several months of not getting paid at all—the influx is welcome, but your bank account will still be depleted.

Another problem: Right now, there’s too much water and nowhere to put it. While California has gargantuan reservoirs to store rainwater and snow melt, most of the state has received rainfall anywhere from 400% to 600% above average since the storms began a few weeks ago. And once reservoirs are full, the water just flows into the ocean.

For instance, Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County was hovering around 30% capacity in early December. After rising 34 feet yesterday, it’s expected to start overflowing Friday or Saturday.

Plus, in cities like LA (which has received around three inches so far), rainwater can’t be collected because it’s been contaminated by road runoff.

The current state of the storms: Around 146,000 customers were left without power as of 7pm ET yesterday and the death toll has risen <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzEwL3dlYXRoZXIvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1mbG9vZGluZy1hdG1vc3BoZXJpYy1yaXZlci10dWVzZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C018290c4> to 17.

The bank has been hit hard by the market downturn and dealmaking drying up, plus its highly anticipated plans to build a consumer business failed to find…any consumers. We’re sure CEO David Solomon will have more to say about his restructuring plan on Goldman’s earnings call next Tuesday.

This proposal would change the rules of existing income-driven repayment plans to slash the payments millions of borrowers need to make on their loans by more than 50%, allowing them to pay off their debt more quickly. As for the broader student loan cancellation plan, the Supreme Court is expected to hear the case next month.

France could make you work longer, and unions are angry.

But French unions, which staged massive protests the last time this plan was floated, have already made plans to strike on Jan. 19 in opposition to the move, which they call unjustified. Even at 64, the retirement age in France would still be lower than it is in other higher-income countries.

While this represents a victory for the burgeoning right-to-repair movement, advocates are wary of the MOU’s lack of enforcement measures and certain sections in the agreement, including one that gives John Deere (or the AFBF) the ability to withdraw from the deal if any federal or state right-to-repair legislation is enacted.

Zoom out: This isn’t the first time a deal like this has been made in the private sector. In 2018, a similar agreement was reached between a lobbying group representing Deere and the California Farm Bureau, but many of the promises didn’t come to pass.—MK

Stat: Chicagoans have a lot of time to contemplate what the Bears should do with the No. 1 NFL Draft pick. That’s because Windy City drivers wasted an average of 155 hours sitting in traffic last year, making Chicago the worst US city <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjMvMDEvMTAvdHJhZmZpYy1jb25nZXN0aW9uLWlucml4LWNvdmlkLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3216fe67> for congestion, according to INRIX’s global traffic scorecard. Traffic picked up in cities all over the world last year, to match (and in some cases exceed) pre-pandemic levels. London was found to be the most congested city globally.

In a speech in Stockholm, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it’s not his job <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MtamVyb21lLXBvd2VsbC1zd2VkZW4tc3RvY2tob2xtLWNsaW1hdGUtYW5kLWVudmlyb25tZW50LWMzZTU4NzVmNGI2ZDdlZmEwNzljODcwZmRjNzc5ZDc0P3JlZj1iaXp0b2MuY29t/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cdae93fb6> to play climate cop for the global financial system. Powell has heard from critics in both directions that the Fed should play a larger (or smaller) role in promoting environmental sustainability in the financial world. Powell also emphasized the need for the Fed to maintain its independence, since political influence could disrupt necessary—but unpopular—interest rate hikes to stamp out inflation.

Good morning. What can you expect from Super Bowl commercials this year? Less crypto, more Gronk. FanDuel announced yesterday that in an ad during the game, Rob Gronkowski will kick a 25-yard field goal live. If he makes it, anyone who placed a Super Bowl bet of $5 or more on FanDuel will split $10 million in free bets on the platform.

Still, recently hard-hit tech stocks like Tesla and several semiconductor companies started getting scooped up once again, pushing the Nasdaq into positive territory.

A bit of good news for the Earthlings reading this: The ozone’s layer is set to be fully restored <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zND9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0728e10a> over most of the world within the next two decades, according to a new UN report.

Trends indicate a full ozone layer recovery by 2040 will take place across the planet, excluding the poles: Ozone bounce back (to 1980, precrisis levels) over the Arctic is expected by 2045, and over the Antarctic by 2066. So keep holding, South Pole property owners, good times are just over the horizon.

So, why does it matter?

Science class refresher:

The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth’s stratosphere, about nine to 18 miles above its surface. This layer shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays linked to cancers and crop damage. In 1985, scientists identified a hole in the ozone layer caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the ozone-depleting chemicals found in air conditioners, refrigerators, and deodorants.

The loss of the ozone layer was one of the most feared environmental issues through most of the 1980s and ’90s, culminating in a poetic reference in Smash Mouth’s 1999 banger “All Star.” Perhaps due to the easily digestible urgency of the problem (a hole that was getting bigger), an international agreement to phase out CFCs known as the Montreal Protocol was reached quickly in 1987.

And, despite a few hiccups—including a 2018 discovery that factories in China were emitting large amounts of banned chemicals—the Montreal Protocol has proven successful. Yesterday’s report found that the primary ozone-depleting gasses in the stratosphere were on the decline from their peaks:

Chlorine decreased 11.5% from its peak in 1993.

Bromine decreased 14.5% from its peak in 1999.

In a bit of a full circle moment, the defunct Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, which helped confirm the ozone layer’s decline in the ’80s, fell back to Earth on Sunday night.—MK

Storms keep slamming California. President Biden declared an emergency <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zOT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0adb160e> in California yesterday after a slew of winter storms drenched the state, causing at least 12 deaths, widespread power outages, and flooding. The declaration will allow federal agencies to coordinate relief efforts as atmospheric rivers and cyclones keep pummeling the northern part of the state. As of yesterday, about 34 million Californians, or ~10% of the US population, were under a flood watch, according to CNN, and Montecito was ordered to evacuate.

Unlike the documents that were seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, however, it appears that Biden’s own attorneys found them and alerted the government, returning them the next day. In other political news yesterday, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy made it through the first test in his hard-won speakership when the House passed the rules it will operate under, as well as a bill rescinding new funding for the IRS that’s unlikely to succeed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Meanwhile, the situation is getting awkward for President Biden, as members of his own party are pressuring him to expel Bolsonaro, who’s been in Florida since days before his successor was sworn in. As for Bolsonaro himself, his wife said yesterday he was in the hospital with abdominal pain.

Windsor watchers who have yet to overdose on British monarchy drama are queuing up at their nearest bookstore. Prince Harry’s memoir, Spare, hits shelves <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zYz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd36a024f> today and bombshell pre-release leaks suggest that it’s a juicy one (we already know more than we want to about royal circumcision).

Royalties for royalty

Celebrity narratives are big business: A four-book deal (allegedly) earned Harry and his wife Meghan up to $40 million. And though literary accolades are likely not on the horizon for Prince Harry (or his ghostwriter), Spare already clinched the No. 1 bestseller spot at both Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

Its publisher, Random House, says it printed 2.5 million copies for North America, betting at least that many readers will be willing to shell out $25 to get further details on how Harry lost his virginity in a field, behind a pub.

Zoom out: Harry and Meghan have not shied away from getting paid to publicly air grievances with family members turning themselves into a powerful media brand after walking away from royal duties. Together they launched a Spotify podcast and a Netflix docuseries. It’s no doubt made them bank, but it’s also made Prince Harry less popular—at least in the UK, where his approval ratings plummeted the most with older people who tend to support the monarchy, according to a recent YouGov poll.—SK

Its creator and head chef, René Redzepi, told the NYT that the way fine dining currently operates is “unsustainable.”

If you couldn’t relate to anyone in The Menu except Margot and wouldn’t shell out $500 for a meal, here’s why this is a BFD:

The Copenhagen-based restaurant has three Michelin stars and has topped the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list so many times (five) that it became ineligible to nab No. 1 again.

Redzepi, who’s been called the greatest chef of his time, co-created “New Nordic” cuisine—which highlights the naturalness of foraged ingredients. If you’ve ever been served an entree on a log, that’s Noma’s influence.

But a lot of unpaid interns had to tweeze fruit leather into the shape of a beetle (seriously <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zaj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C44cd9237>) to get Noma to the top. Grueling hours, low pay, and a workplace culture that would get zero stars on Glassdoor has become the norm in fine dining restaurants.

Redzepi told the NYT, “Financially and emotionally, as an employer and as a human being, it just doesn’t work.”

Looking ahead…in 2024, Noma will be converted into a culinary lab where Redzepi will pickle and ferment foods we’ve never heard of.—JW

Last week’s historic, bare-knuckle brawl to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker was a sign that in this 118th Congress, we’ve ain’t seen nothing yet. Concerns grew over the weekend that the chaos and brinkmanship that characterized the 15-round speaker vote could foreshadow nasty infighting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3VzLXBvbGljeS8yMDIzLzAxLzA3L2dvcC1idWRnZXQtZGVidC1saW1pdC1rZXZpbi1tY2NhcnRoeS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C78246370> around the biggest legislative issues of the year.

After all, electing a House speaker in just one ballot has been mostly a foregone conclusion since the Civil War. So if you can barely dice the onions, how are you supposed to make the entire chili?

The No. 1 issue: debt ceiling

The biggest challenge for Congress to tackle in 2023 is raising the debt ceiling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wNy91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9zcGVha2VyLWVsZWN0aW9uLWRlYnQtbGltaXQtcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMuaHRtbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1d75b5cf>.

What is the debt ceiling? It’s a limit on what the US government can borrow to pay its bills. And since the government runs on budget deficits, it regularly needs to borrow more money to avoid a credit default, which would be a disastrous scenario. Should a potential default materialize due to congressional paralysis, it could crater global markets and plunge the US into a recession.

So, what’s the status? In 2021, Congress raised the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion—but that will only get us to August, when Goldman Sachs predicts that lawmakers will need to raise the roof again to avert a default.

Here’s where the McCarthy vote comes into play: The small faction of hardline Republicans who held up McCarthy’s election as speaker could, in effect, hold the debt ceiling “hostage” by getting their demands—specifically, spending cuts to domestic programs and the military—into any debt limit bill. Given their outsized leverage in the Republican Party’s slim majority in the House, this group could bring debt ceiling negotiations perilously close to the expiration date, which is worrying economists over the downstream effects on markets.

Looking ahead…the concerns about gridlock may become real starting today, when the House will vote on a rules package that determines how the chamber will operate during its term. Some Republicans expressed hesitation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy9qYW4vMDgva2V2aW4tbWNjYXJ0aHktaG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci1uZXh0LWZpZ2h0LXJ1bGVzLXBhY2thZ2U_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cad4ff5ce> this weekend about approving these rules due to the still unknown concessions McCarthy must have granted the hardline faction to secure his speaker seat.

Many called for the removal of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sworn in last week, piggybacking on Bolsonaro’s baseless attacks on the legitimacy of October’s election. Leaders across the world, including in the US, condemned the riots as undemocratic. Security forces said they took back control of the buildings.

Travelers still need to show a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of entering China, but that’s nothing compared to the up to three weeks of isolation that were imposed on visitors during the pandemic. The tens of thousands of people traveling to and from Hong Kong yesterday cheered the opportunity to see loved ones again.

The “robot” is actually an artificial intelligence algorithm created by the company DoNotPay. It’ll run on a smartphone located in the defendant’s pocket and, through an earpiece, will advise them on what to say after hearing the arguments presented during the hearing.

DoNotPay is keeping the specifics of its “experiment” mostly under wraps, since what it’s doing violates courtroom protocol, but we do know the hearing involves a speeding charge <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXptb2RvLmNvbS9kb25vdHBheS1zcGVlZGluZy10aWNrZXQtY2hhdGdwdC0xODQ5OTYwMjcyP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C135ff807>. Interestingly, no one in court other than the defendant will know that an AI lawyer is even involved (DoNotPay will use a hearing accessibility loophole to get the defendant to wear AirPods).

DoNotPay said it’ll cover any fines or fees incurred by the defendant if its AI gets stage fright in court or if they otherwise lose the challenge.

Will inflation continue its decline? We’ll find out on Thursday, when the latest consumer price index report drops. Inflation had been on the comedown toward the end of 2022, but some Fed officials warn it’s too soon to declare victory—and that inflation remains far too high above typical levels.

Most people don’t toast to government data on a Friday night, but a report on the job market that dropped yesterday inspired cautious optimism: There might be a way out of our current inflation hellscape without bringing the economy to the brink of collapse after all.

The big numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics report:

The unemployment rate dropped <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMDEtMDYvdXMtaGlyaW5nLXRvcHMtZm9yZWNhc3RzLWpvYmxlc3MtcmF0ZS1mYWxscy1hcy13YWdlLWdhaW5zLXNsb3c_c3JlZj1La1B6cFp2eg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1e3d2005> to 3.5%, the lowest it’s been in 50 years.

The US added 223,000 nonfarm jobs in December. Though job growth slowed from the previous month, the labor market is still going strong.

In 2022, 4.5 million total jobs were added, compared with 6.7 million in 2021.

But the number that really got people talking was the lower-than-expected month over month wage growth, which slowed to .3% in December and 4.6% annually.

While that might not sound like welcome news to anyone who doesn’t live off a fortune inherited from their robber baron granddad, the folks at the Federal Reserve are most certainly pleased. Rapidly growing paychecks are seen as one of the key drivers of inflation, which the Fed has been trying to tame with aggressive interest rate hikes since early last year.

Economists have dubbed the jobs data a “Goldilocks” situation—not too hot, and not too cold. Since the labor shortage and the strident wage growth it drove seem to be abating, the hope is that inflation will continue to decline. At the same time, a strong labor market (fingers crossed) might just allow the economy to avoid a recession caused by the interest rate increases.

Zoom out: Experts expect slowing wage growth to signal to the Fed that it’s time to chill with the aggressive rate hikes. And it’s not just speculation: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said yesterday that he’d lean toward just a 25 basis point increase (as opposed to 50 basis points) for the next interest rate hike if the labor market continues to cool.—SK

The final weekend of the NFL’s regular season is typically among the most exciting dates on the sports calendar each year, featuring high-stakes games where teams jockey for playoff spots and higher seeds in the postseason.

And that’ll happen again today when Week 18 kicks off, albeit under the giant cloud of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest during a game Monday—a horrific injury that has shaken players, coaches, and fans of the game.

Hamlin update: He had his breathing tube removed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmZsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzUzOTE4MTIvYmlsbHMtZGFtYXItaGFtbGluLWJyZWF0aGluZy1vd24tdHViZS1yZW1vdmVkP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7378db86> and has been talking and FaceTiming with family and his teammates. “I love you, boys,” he told his fellow Bills players yesterday.

Meanwhile, the NFL has announced a few tributes and changes in light of the incident:

Teams have been given a number of options to support Hamlin, including painting “3” (his jersey number) in Bills colors on their 30-yard line.

After canceling the Bills–Bengals game in which Hamlin collapsed, the NFL unveiled a complex set of scenarios for the playoffs, which include the AFC Championship Game potentially being played at a neutral site.

In the biggest scandal to hit Facebook since we got banned for offering a bag of half-eaten tortilla chips in our neighborhood Buy Nothing group, indie romance author Susan Meachen posted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnV6emZlZWRuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2tlbHNleXdlZWttYW4vc3VzYW4tbWVhY2hlbi1hdXRob3ItYWxsZWdlZC1kZWF0aC1ob2F4P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C65d66de9> that she’s actually alive.

She faked her own death for over two years. Meachen is/was/??? known in the romance writing world for self-publishing over a dozen books and running a successful niche Facebook group. In 2020, a post supposedly written by her daughter claimed that she had died by suicide because of bullying from other authors.

Then, on Monday, Meachen posted in the same Facebook group that was used to announce her death that she was alive and ready to start writing again, ending her post with “Let the fun begin.”

While her friends and fans were glad to find out she was alive, they were also horrified. Some asked where the money they crowdfunded for funeral costs went. After Meachen’s supposed death, the community even edited her final novel for free and helped promote it in her honor.

What the twist? No one’s quite sure why Meachen did this. The only explanation she offered in her post was, “My family did what they thought was best for me.”—MM

The fire started in the facility’s butter storage room, sending melted butter flowing “three inches thick” down the stairs that led to it—which firefighters struggled to crawl up while hanging onto a slippery hose. Nobody was hurt in the blaze, but the butter river did make its way into storm drains, clogging a historic canal.

Good morning. The US House of Representatives still does not have a speaker since a small faction of rebels in the Republican party keep blocking Rep. Kevin McCarthy from securing the 218 votes needed to clinch the position.

And after going 0–11 in votes so far, McCarthy is racking up a losing streak that’s verging on Process-era Philadelphia 76ers territory. In fact, the only times the House has needed more ballots to choose a speaker was before the Civil War.

Will today be the day for a breakthrough, or just another scene from Groundhog Day? We’ll find out when the House reconvenes at noon ET today.

The potential rule would ban noncompete agreements, a common mechanism used by companies to keep employees from jumping ship and working for competitors.

It’s been a long time coming

In a 2021 executive order, President Biden asked the FTC (led by antitrust shark Lina Khan) to target noncompetes. And the proposal the agency came up with flexes more muscle than it has in the past: The plan would make all new and existing noncompetes illegal, as well as require companies to inform employees that any previous noncompete agreements are void.

Why are noncompetes a thing? They’re pitched as a way to protect trade secrets so someone working at Domino’s doesn’t leave and design a pizza tracker app for Pizza Hut (okay, not a bad idea). But as noncompetes have flooded industries across the board, the FTC—and even the Treasury Department <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30167710.3067832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMtcGF5LXdvcmtlcnMtbGVzcy10aGFuLXdvcnRoLWJpZGVuLXdhbnRzLXRvLWNoYW5nZS0yMDIyLTM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7b584225>—say these clauses are essentially trapping workers in lower wages. Putting an end to the practice could boost wages by $300 billion every year, and release workers from career inertia, per the FTC.

Noncompetes are truly everywhere: In one high-profile case in 2016, Jimmy John’s settled a lawsuit with the Illinois state attorney general’s office, saying it would not enforce its noncompete that barred workers from making subs (and sub-adjacents) within a three-mile radius of any JJ shops for two years. As if Jersey Mike’s would even need those dry sandwich secrets.

Looking ahead…the FTC’s 3–1 vote in favor of the proposed rule is the first step of the agency’s rulemaking process. Next up is 60 days of public comment. But there’s no date set for a final vote, and the plan is sure to face challenges even if it does cross the finish line. The US Chamber of Commerce—which represents a lot of big, powerful corporations—threatened legal action against such a change in 2021.—MM

Big January-in-the-Northeast vibes out of Bed Bath & Beyond yesterday, as the company announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30167710.3067832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wNS9idXNpbmVzcy9iZWQtYmF0aC1iZXlvbmQtYmFua3J1cHRjeS5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce6c88968> in a public filing that it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue and could potentially file for bankruptcy.

BBBY expects to report a 33% sales decline compared to Q3 last year (which included Black Friday). The company anticipates losses to reach $385.8 million—a 40% spike from last year—and warned that it may not have cash for suppliers and lease agreements in the coming months. In response, shares fell to their lowest level in ~30 years, marking a 96% decline from the stock’s recent peak during its period in the memestock limelight (more on that in a bit).

What happened? Maybe shoppers are just less impressed by towels these days. But more likely the retailer also committed a self-own by replacing big brands with private labels amid supply chain snarls and at a time when pandemic-era shoppers wanted to shell out for a Kitchen-Aid.

But it turns out that drinking 0% ABV lagers has turned into a year-round phenomenon for health-conscious customers.

Retail sales of nonalcoholic beverages grew more than 20% last year, and 120% over three years, per Nielsen.

Meanwhile, sales of alcoholic beer and wine have declined year over year, and alcoholic spirit sales grew less than 1% annually.

That’s not to say people are teetotaling. Actually, over eight in 10 people who buy nonalcoholic drinks also buy alcoholic drinks. Plus, the nonalcoholic drinks sector, despite its recent growth, is a shot glass to Big Alcohol’s das boot, with the former representing a tiny 0.47% of the broader buzzed industry.—JW

These astronomical prices were fueled by three uber-expensive gene therapies approved by the FDA—one of them, from Hemgenix, costs $3.5 million, making it the most expensive drug ever. Congress did cap annual drug price increases via the Inflation Reduction Act, but that doesn’t cover the cost of new medications. Drugmakers, meanwhile, say the cost of their drugs doesn’t reflect what patients pay out-of-pocket for them.

Last year, the retailer warned that increased theft (or “shrinkage,” in industry terms) would account for a meaty 3.5% of sales, so it hired private security guards and barricaded toiletries like they were the “Mona Lisa.” But apparently the level of shrinkage hasn’t been significant and those guards weren’t effective, so it’s winding down its use of private security companies.

Friday puzzle

This is an unusual paragraph. I’m curious as to just how quickly you can find out what is so unusual about it. It looks so ordinary and plain that you would think nothing was wrong with it. In fact, nothing is wrong with it! It is highly unusual though. Study it and think about it. You still may not find anything odd. But if you work at it a bit, you might find out. Try to do so without any coaching.

Good morning. Sometimes workplace dreams do come true. In an attempt to “purge” employees’ calendars, the e-commerce company Shopify said it’s banning recurring meetings with three or more people, limiting big meetings to one per week, and urging staff to turn down other meeting requests.

Maybe something to bring up at your next meeting during the 15 seconds of heavy breathing after you ask how everyone’s weekend was.

The newly elected 118th Congress convened for the first time yesterday, getting back to work after some holiday time off. Unlike the rest of us, though, Congress has the added benefit of getting to vote for who their boss will be.

This time around, the process is going—well—historically bad.

GOP leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy failed to win his bid to become the speaker of the House yesterday, falling short of the 218 votes needed to secure the position. While multiple voting rounds for House speaker might sound somewhat ordinary, it’s actually an extremely rare event—it’s only happened 14 times in US history, with the most recent time being 100 years ago and the 13 other instances occurring before the Civil War. Later in the afternoon, McCarthy again fell short in two more rounds of voting.

Why it matters

With a narrow majority in the House, the GOP needs to optimize these early days by organizing and setting the stage for their agenda leading up to the 2024 general election. But, since the speaker administers the oath of office to House members-elect, no business can be done until the position is filled.

Also on hold: appointing chairs and members to key committees (delaying the preparation of bills and hearings), adopting new House rules, and voting on legislation (such as raising the nation’s debt ceiling to keep the government funded).

Coming up…once the dust settles, which hopefully happens faster than it took the 34th Congress to choose a leader in 1856 (133 rounds of voting over a roughly two-month span), the new GOP majority has some plans. Republicans say they want to take on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and probe vaccine mandates and the origins of Covid. They’ve also pledged to change pandemic-induced rules about proxy voting and scale back the IRS expansion included in the Inflation Reduction Act.—MK

Politicians who supported the law are hoping the pause on nonresidents purchasing condos will help cool the blazing housing market that peaked in February with average house prices hitting $800k (CAD). The Canadian Real Estate Association isn’t too happy, though—it claims the measure could force other countries to retaliate and bar Canadians from buying second homes outside of the country.

Good news for anyone who was busy shorting Tesla instead of making New Year’s Eve plans: Tesla’s stock plummeted more than 12% yesterday for its worst trading session in more than two years.

Tesla’s brutal selloff was the continuation of a dramatic downward trend: The most valuable automaker in the world lost 65% of its value in 2022.

And while it may be easy to pin the blame on CEO Elon Musk’s fascination with his shiny new toy, Twitter, the problems lie deeper than a distracted boss:

Production has slowed down due to Covid shutdowns in China.

Demand has cooled for its vehicles due to lower gas prices, interest rate hikes, and increased competition.

It has suffered from logistical issues that were at least partially to blame for its inability to deliver all of the vehicles that it produced.

Tesla has tried to take steps to boost business, to apparently little effect so far. It recently tried luring lovers of clean-tech luxury with a $7,500 discount in the US. It’s also offered price cuts to customers in China.—SK

Turns out that Snickerdoodle Haze pot laced rice crispy treat is pretty appetizing to kids. Reports of children under the age of six accidentally consuming edibles with marijuana in them have jumped <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30146320.3043546/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbWFyaWp1YW5hLWVkaWJsZXMta2lkcy1yaXNrcy1iZjU1Yzg1YmUyYzI3MjBhNDk4OGU2ZWNlZGFmZGI5NT91dG1fc291cmNlPWhvbWVwYWdlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09VG9wTmV3cyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cG9zaXRpb25fMDk/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6daef814> 1,375% between 2017 and 2021, according to a new study in the academic journal Pediatrics.

The details: In 2017 there were 207 cases reported to poison control centers in the US. But by 2021 that number jumped to 3,054, totaling 7,043 such incidents in the five-year period. Over half of those reports involved toddlers aged two or three. But before you retweet the “pot smokers are giving my kids edibles for Halloween!” stories, know that 91% of the cases stemmed from kids getting the edibles in their own home.

Why the spike? Medical professionals say the numbers likely spiked as legalization proliferated (37 states + Washington, DC, allow medical marijuana use, and 21 allow recreational use). Plus, some edibles packaging mimics that of non-THC candy or desserts and isn’t childproof.

Big picture: Cannabis ingestion is still just a sliver of the total 850,000 annual poisonings in the under-six age group, but its rapid growth has doctors worried, especially since THC can cause serious complications for kids. Researchers tracked 5,000 specific cases and found that 8% of the kids were put in critical care units at hospitals.—MM

That comes out to an average of at least one of the trucks selling every 49 seconds in 2022, Ford said.

Markets: One of the best things about New Year’s is the opportunity for a fresh slate. Let’s hope this empty-for-now Markets graphic fills up with more green than in 2022, when the S&P suffered its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008. This week will be a short one for investors, since markets were closed yesterday for the New Year’s holiday.

Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is in critical condition <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30137291.3482340/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmZsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzUzNjgzNzIvZGFtYXItaGFtbGluLWNvbGxhcHNlcy1maWVsZC1iaWxscy1iZW5nYWxzLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LXN1c3BlbmRlZD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8842d913> at a Cincinnati hospital after he suffered cardiac arrest in the first quarter of last night’s NFL game, according to the Bills. The game, a highly anticipated Monday Night Football matchup between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals, was suspended by the league just over an hour after the incident occurred.

What happened: After Hamlin took a hard hit while tackling Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins, he stood up for several seconds and then fell to the ground. Medical personnel rushed to attend to Hamlin, administered CPR, and gave him oxygen before he was taken off the field in an ambulance, per the ESPN broadcast.

During those moments, “this went from a sports story to a news story, from a sporting event to a matter of life and death,” announcer Joe Buck said on ESPN. Players became emotional on the field, praying together for Hamlin’s health.

The NFL also drew criticism for its handling of the situation

The ESPN broadcast booth said that shortly after the incident, players were given five minutes to warm up before play would restart. Then, the coaches of the two teams met and the players left the field. Many sports analysts and fans questioned why it took so long for the NFL to postpone the game, arguing that the players were clearly in no condition to resume playing after witnessing Hamlin receive CPR on the field.

Big picture: This frightening moment was a reminder of the violence inherent in one of the world’s biggest entertainment properties, and how the players are, in the end, humans—not just items on a fantasy football roster. And Hamlin appears to be a person who’s especially generous. Starting in 2020, Hamlin raised money to run a toy drive for children in his Pennsylvania hometown. In the hours following his collapse, fans found the original GoFundMe <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30137291.3482340/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29mdW5kbWUuY29tL2YvbXhrc2MtdGhlLWNoYXNpbmctbXMtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1jb21tdW5pdHktdG95LWRyaXZlP3FpZD0zZmI3N2ViMWQ1OWY0MzQwM2JmOGQwZTZkYmUxNzllYw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cda08d4ea> for the event (initial goal: $2,500) and contributed more than $3 million in donations.

The headline stat: Global equities lost a record $18 trillion in 2022 amid nearly 300 interest rate hikes from central banks around the world.

But not all stocks were clobbered equally by Jerome Powell and Co.: High-growth tech companies that got a boost from an era of low interest rates got rocked the most in what some are calling the sequel to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000–01. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted four straight negative quarters for the first time since that crash.

Others survived unscathed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30137291.3482340/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGUteWVhci1iaWctdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtZmVsbC1mcm9tLWdsb3J5LTExNjcyNTQzOTUyP21vZD1ocF9sZWFkX3BvczM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb0e0c63e>. The energy sector soared 59% last year thanks to a boost from surging oil prices. Exxon Mobil finished the year as the eighth-most valuable public company in the US, despite starting 2022 outside the top 25.

So what will this year hold?

No one really knows, but analysts generally think stocks will go sideways, weighed down by more rate hikes and a potential recession. The average Bloomberg projection for the S&P at the end of 2023 is 4,009 points (the index closed 2022 at 3,839.50).

Another down year would be extremely rare: The S&P has dropped for two consecutive years in just four instances since 1928.

New year, new Congress: The 118th Congress will convene today. In a switch-up from the last two years, the GOP has control of the House (but the Dems retained their majority in the Senate). Some key things to watch: whether Kevin McCarthy will be chosen as Speaker of the House today, all the investigations to be launched by Republican lawmakers, and what happens to GOP Rep. George Santos, who admitted to falsifying a significant amount of his background.
