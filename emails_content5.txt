Another company goes after FL’s ‘anti-woke’ agenda <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6MZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Books disappearing from bookshelf <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6MZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Francis Scialabba
Publisher Penguin Random House and advocacy group PEN America sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6M-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> a Florida school district yesterday over book bans, joining Disney in pushing back against the state’s “anti-woke” policies that critics say censor free speech and infringe on civil rights.

The details: PEN America, Penguin, and five authors of banned books filed a federal lawsuit against the Escambia County School District and School Board, claiming they violated the First Amendment by banning 10 books from its school libraries. The suit also alleges the groups violated the constitutional equal protection clause because most of the books targeted included themes of race, sexuality, or gender.

A number of books including George M. Johnson’s All Boys Aren’t Blue, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, and Judy Blume’s Forever… were challenged by one single language arts teacher, according to the suit. And it claims that despite a review committee ruling the books were OK for young readers, the school board still removed them. The lawsuit wants the banned books back in libraries. Escambia County School District has declined to comment.

What’s so special about Escambia County’s book bans? PEN America said this specific school district has attempted to ban or restrict almost 200 books.

It’s also in Florida…

...which has been churning out laws restricting what educators can say and teach, including at the collegiate level <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6M_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628>. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president, signed four bills limiting LGBTQ+ rights yesterday, one of which expanded the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law to prohibit teachers from discussing gender or sexual orientation with students through eighth grade (up from third grade).

That’s the law at the center of the bitter dispute between Disney and DeSantis. Disney, one of the biggest private employers in Florida, criticized the legislation and has sued DeSantis over what it called an “anti-business, and patently unconstitutional” effort by the governor to punish Disney for its criticism.

Looking ahead…it remains to be seen whether DeSantis’s spat with Disney and his broader “anti-woke” agenda will be popular among voters as he gears up to run for president. He took an L this week when Jacksonville, the largest city in Florida, elected a Democrat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> as its next mayor over DeSantis’s candidate.—MM

Tour de headlines TikTok lock ban bad Francis Scialabba
Montana bans TikTok. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a law that makes Montana the first US state <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> to comprehensively ban the Chinese-owned app. While other states have banned TikTok on government-issued devices over national security concerns, Montana’s law blocks the app from operating inside its borders and penalizes app stores from making TikTok available for download in Montana. The ban goes into effect on Jan. 1, but you can bet opponents (like TikTok and free speech advocates) will take Montana to court over this major escalation.

Things are about to get heated. The World Meteorological Organization estimates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> that there’s a 66% chance the world will experience warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, at least temporarily, by 2027. The number has long been considered a breaking point for keeping climate change in check. The group expects that the extra heat from the natural El Niño weather phenomenon coupled with human-caused warming will likely make the next five years the hottest on record.

Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Markle’s mom were involved in a “near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi” for over two hours on Tuesday night after leaving a gala in New York City, according to the couple’s spokesperson. As the news hit yesterday morning, everyone was reminded of the paparazzi chase that Harry blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana.

But police painted a different picture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N8?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> than the “near catastrophic” episode described by Harry and Meghan. The NYPD said that there were no collisions or injuries reported, while police sources told ABC that the amount of paparazzi involved was not at the levels described by the couple’s spokesperson.

At one point in the night, the couple got into a taxi. The driver didn’t feel threatened by the photographers: He told the Washington Post <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6N9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> that his passengers “were quiet and seemed scared, but it’s New York—it’s safe.”

Prince Harry versus the tabloids

This isn’t the only tangle Harry has going on with the tabloids. He and Meghan are actively involved in three lawsuits against newspapers in the UK, alleging unlawful information gathering via phone hacking.

And Harry is serious about controlling the narrative: He’s expected to testify in court next month. The last time a senior member of the royal family appeared in court was in 1891, when Edward VII served as a witness to an alleged card-cheating scandal.—CC

CRISPR lettuce for your summer salad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Nd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Scientists at Pairwise have gene-edited mustard greens to be less bitter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Nd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628> Hannah Minn
Genetically edited mustard greens are coming for the salad base throne thanks to scientists who have figured out how to remove the trait that makes the nutritious vegetable taste so bitter.

The new and improved milder mustard greens from agriculture startup Pairwise will be the first food on the US market to have been tweaked using the revolutionary gene-editing tool CRISPR. The modified greens are already being served in a few restaurants and will begin hitting grocery stores this summer.

But you probably won’t know they’re anything special from the packaging. Unlike GMO foods that bend the laws of nature by incorporating genes from other species, gene-edited foods contain modified versions of their own genes, so the USDA doesn’t require the “bioengineered” label it slaps on GMOs.

The logic is that gene-editing merely speeds up a process that can occur naturally: Rather than using the centuries-old crossbreeding methods that can take a decade to alter traits, scientists used CRISPR to directly edit the mustard greens DNA for debittered lettuce in just four years, according to Wired <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ne?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31517464.2876628>.

New priorities: Until recently, gene editing and genetic modification had been used mainly to boost crop yields. Mustard greens 2.0 is all about getting consumers to substitute iceberg and other nutrient-lacking lettuce for a more nutritional vegetable.—ML

Markets: Stocks took a hit from disappointing retail sales data and, you’re never going to believe this, ongoing concerns about smashing through the debt ceiling. However, Capital One got a boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> after Warren Buffett said it’s in his wallet. Buffett’s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, has taken a nearly $1 billion stake in the bank, according to a Tuesday filing.

Debt ceiling update: Progress, maybe? After more negotiations, GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said a deal to raise the debit limit was “possible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ka?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432>” by the end of the week, while President Biden is leaving his upcoming trip to Asia earlier than planned to push through an agreement.

AI is in its regulation era <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Sam Altman at Senate hearing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Win McNamee/Getty Images
Typically when a tech CEO goes in front of a Senate committee, they end up explaining how to use email. Not so yesterday, when Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, testified <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> on Capitol Hill on the future of AI and how the field should be regulated.

What happened at the hearing? Setting an ominous tone for what was to come, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, read opening remarks that he later revealed were created by AI. The hearing continued with a discussion of the dangers presented by an unpredictable, evolving technology that can create and spread misleading information without us even realizing it (looking at you, drippy pope).

Lawmakers acknowledged past failures to implement timely regulation for advances in technology. Sen. Blumenthal said, “Congress failed to meet the moment on social media,” and hinted at wanting to avoid the same mistake again.

Regulating AI is like herding kittens on rollerskates Experts don’t agree on what regulation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6K6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> should look like for AI because it’s evolving much faster than other technologies. And moving quickly (or at all) isn’t exactly Congress’s strong suit, so it’s unclear whether traditional lawmaking can keep up with the regulation of a technology that is constantly changing.

But they’ll try. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is working alongside experts to create a framework that focuses on transparency within AI models. It would require that models disclose who trained them and their data sources, but the proposal will likely face resistance from AI companies.

Altman, who warned “if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” is also in favor of regulation—but came with his own ideas. He advocated for the creation of a new government agency with the power to license large AI models, create and monitor safety standards, and conduct independent audits. But he did not mention requiring transparency around model training or source data.

Looking ahead…expect the regulation talk to heat up as both Congress and tech leaders try to figure out how to manage the existential risk posed by AI.—CC

San Antonio won the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.

Wenbanyama combines a 7-foot-5 frame with skills no player of his height should have, like smooth handles and a 3-point-shot. The two times the Spurs had the No. 1 pick in the draft, they chose well, selecting all-time players David Robinson (1987) and Tim Duncan (1997).

Taco Bell wants to free T*co T*esday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Taco out of open cage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> Francis Scialabba
Normally the villain of your insides, Taco Bell is trying to be a hero by freeing the name “Taco Tuesday” from its IP prison. The fast-food chain filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6FT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31505854.2881432> a petition yesterday to cancel the trademark of the phrase owned by a smaller taco chain, Taco John’s.

Taco John’s, maker of the also-trademarked Potato Olés, has owned the trademark on Taco Tuesday in 49 states since 1989 and has not been shy about sending cease-and-desist letters to anyone who tries to use it to promote tacos…on Tuesday.

In the one state where Taco John’s doesn’t have the trademark—New Jersey—a restaurant and bar called Gregory’s owns it. Taco Bell filed to Baja blast away Gregory’s trademark as well.

The creators of the Crunchwrap Supreme (also trademarked) said in a press release that the phrase “should belong to all who make, sell, eat and celebrate tacos”—so it won’t be seeking damages or future trademarking of the phrase on its own. In response, Taco John’s announced…a Taco Tuesday deal.

Could Taco Bell win this thing? In 2019, LeBron James tried to trademark Taco Tuesday, and the US Patent and Trademark Office rejected his app, saying that the phrase was just too common (thereby kind of admitting no company should hold a trademark on it). Taco Bell might be hoping this precedent will work in its favor, but it will likely be a couple years until the beef is resolved.—MM

Good morning. Yesterday, Sports Illustrated announced that 81-year-old Martha Stewart will appear on one of the covers of this year’s Swimsuit Issue, making her the oldest SI Swimsuit cover model ever. Between this and hard-launching Pete Davidson’s current relationship, Stewart is having a productive 2023.

Fun fact: Which model did Stewart dethrone as the oldest SI cover star? Maye Musk, who appeared on last year’s cover at age 74. Yes, that’s Elon Musk’s mom.

If you’ve been dropping plastic a lot and hoping it’ll take care of itself later, join the club. Yesterday, the New York Fed released its Q1 report on household debt: Findings include a record-high debt level of $17 trillion, persistent credit card debt, and rising delinquency rates.

A typical first quarter sees credit card balances decline as people pay off what they spent over the holidays while trying to out-gift their in-laws. But, for the first time in 20 years, that isn’t the case, according to Bloomberg. Balances remained flat over Q1, suggesting that people aren’t cutting back and are probably using credit cards to finance daily spending due to the rising cost of…pretty much everything.

It’s not just that credit card balances are flat. Delinquency is rising, as is its intimidating older brother, serious delinquency, which is when a debt is 90+ days past due. The Fed’s report showed that 4.57% of credit card debt transitioned to serious delinquency last quarter, up from 3.04% in Q1 of 2022. And for credit card holders aged 18–29, 8.3% of balances were in serious delinquency.

Plastic isn’t the only thing to blame In addition to causing lots of folks to check their credit card balance real quick, the report had a few key takeaways:

Auto loan delinquencies are higher than they were before the pandemic for those under 40. The average monthly car payment is $729.

Mortgage debt increased by $121 billion in the first quarter, reaching a $12.04 trillion balance, likely as a result of the Fed’s rate increase extravaganza.

Student debt saw a slight decrease in the rate of serious delinquency, which went down to less than 1%—but that’s probably because repayment is paused for now.

Zoom out: Debt balances are almost $3 trillion higher than pre-pandemic, but Fed analysts see an upside; many households are still more financially stable than they were before thanks to the mortgage refi boom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BU?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> of 2020–2021 when rates were at their lowest.—CC

Virtuix has already raised over $35m. And if you add to that by investing just $1k, you’ll get 30% off your very own Omni One treadmill. That’s a $780 value.

Tour de headlines Illustration of a Call of Duty skeleton with Microsoft logo in his eyes Illustration: Dianna “Mick” McDougall, Photo: Call of Duty/Activision
At least the EU likes Microsoft’s $69b deal to buy Activision. In a win Microsoft needed to keep its deal with Activision alive, EU antitrust regulators gave its efforts to acquire the Call of Duty-maker the green light <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> yesterday. But Microsoft still has an uphill battle to get the deal through antitrust watchdogs in the UK and the US. UK regulators rejected the deal last month, and yesterday criticized the fixes accepted by its EU counterpart. And in the States, the FTC has sued to block it.

FBI comes under fire for Trump-Russia probe. Trump-appointed Special Counsel John Durham has finally released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6BZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> his report on the agency’s probe into allegations linking former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign to Russia, and he concluded that the investigation should never have happened. The 306-page report states that the agency rushed into the investigation based on “raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,” while being much more cautious regarding claims against Hillary Clinton. The report is unlikely to end partisan fighting over the issue, especially since Durham’s four years of work yielded few court victories.

Vice Media filed for bankruptcy. The company, which was valued at $5.7 billion in 2017, filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Co?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday and plans to sell itself to a group of creditors for $225 million. It’s the latest in a string of digital media companies to stumble recently after advertising revenue became harder to come by. Vice’s filing was also one of seven large companies to head to bankruptcy court in a 48 hour period—marking the largest number of filings during a two-day period since 2008, according to Bloomberg.

He’s about to secure <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6B_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> a $100 million funding round for an eye scan-enabled global cryptocurrency, worldcoin, according to the Financial Times.

It’s not totally unrelated to his signature project: Worldcoin’s goal is to verify whether users are human by scanning their irises to disburse universal basic income...to workers displaced by AI.

Finding investors for a crypto startup during crypto winter is just one of Altman’s side projects. The venture capitalist’s resume increasingly looks like a cyberpunk manga.

The Altman-backed nuclear fission startup, Helion Energy, recently notched a deal to supply electricity to Microsoft in 2028, even though most experts say that timeline for making the tech work is a long shot.

But so is expanding the average human lifespan by 10 years, a research effort by Retro Biosciences, which the serial entrepreneur plugged with $180 million.

Zoom out: This may all sound like the beginning of a dystopian sci-fi scenario, but Altman claims he’s aware of the potential dangers of his ventures and is concerned with more than just profit. Still, some worry that he won’t be able to build technology at a breakneck pace without unleashing chaos.—SK

Whoever has been making sacrifices to the free television gods just got their prayers answered. The hardware startup Telly is giving away 500,000 55-inch 4K flat-screens at no cost to your wallet.

But, like most free things, the TV comes with a catch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431>: constant advertisements and data collection.

A never-ending ad stream will live on the dual-screen TV’s lower “Smart Screen,” a nine-inch addendum that can also show weather, stocks, and other widgets. The main screen might also display ads when you’re not using it.

You’ll also have to answer some demographic and psychographic questions when you sign up to make the ads more targeted: “If Toyota wants to run an ad to people that currently own a Honda whose lease expires within the next 12 months, we pick and choose those individual TVs,” Telly co-founder Ilya Pozin, who also co-founded Pluto TV, told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> the Hollywood Reporter.

If you’re okay with all that, you can reserve a free TV on Telly’s website <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6C6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431>. They’re expected to ship this summer.

Zoom out: Marketers say it was only a matter of time before a free TV emerged, since prices for devices like Roku and smart TV sets have been coming down as ad sales have grown. Ad spending for internet-connected TVs rose from about $6 billion in 2019 to more than $21 billion in 2022, according to Statista.—ML

Key performance indicators An image from the Netflix show Queen Cleopatra Queen Cleopatra/Netflix
Stat: Netflix’s Queen Cleopatra was in the streamer’s top 10 television show yesterday, but any success came in spite of the show’s audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. The series, which debuted last week, had a 1% audience <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Ca?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> score over the weekend before ticking up to 2% yesterday with 2,500+ reviews in (by contrast, the Elizabeth Taylor version blamed for destroying multiple marriages has a 68% audience score). But the barrage of negative reviews likely stems as much from the backlash against the casting of a Black British woman as the iconic Egyptian queen as from anything to do with the Jada Pinkett Smith-produced series—though its score from professional critics is only 11%.

Quote: “The thing that I miss the most about being on the surface is literally the sun.”

University of South Florida Joseph Dituri, who also goes by Dr. Deep Sea, recently beat the world record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6Cb?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31491786.2900431> for time spent living underwater without depressurization by spending 74 days 30 feet deep in a Key Largo lagoon inside the Jules’ Undersea Lodge. And he’s not about to surface any time soon—he plans to spend 100 days there to complete his research. But despite ascribing to the philosophy that it’s better down where it’s wetter, Dituri admitted he misses seeing the sun rise. He doesn’t miss class, though—he’s still teaching online.

Markets: Despite the risk of the US defaulting on its debts next month, equity investors have kept calm and carried on <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ww?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>, sending the Nasdaq to a weekly gain last week. But over in the bond market, investors are sweating. The cost of credit-default swaps, which act as insurance over a default, is higher in the US than in emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil.

GEOGRAPHY

The suburbs are buzzing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> Suburban mall in Virginia <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> Robert Knopes/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
Have a few morning meetings, hit a Sweetgreen for lunch, finish up work, then go see your favorite band play a show—sounds like a day you could only pull off in a city.

Not anymore. As Axios reported, the rise of remote work has breathed new life <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> into America’s suburbs, drowning out the roar of leaf blowers with commercial growth, an influx of new residents, and increased cultural opportunities, like legitimately good restaurants <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>.

Retailers show the way

You’ve read headlines about major retailers closing stores in downtowns. But the reverse is happening in the suburbs, where retailers are opening new locations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to meet customers where they live and, increasingly, work. The availability of urban retail topped suburban availability in the second half of last year for the first time since at least 2013, the WSJ reported citing CBRE data.

Case study: Sweetgreen.

In 2019, 35% of Sweetgreen’s real estate footprint was in the suburbs.

As of last summer, half of its locations are rockin’ the suburbs.

Even suburban malls, which have been given their last rites for decades, appear to be recuperating. Shopping center landlords are setting leasing and occupancy records this year, according to the WSJ.

A trickle into a flood

The US suburban population had been increasing before the pandemic, growing 10.5% between 2010 and 2020, according to the Census. But lawns and patios became even more attractive during Covid, and the desire to live your best North Caldwell life has stuck around post-pandemic. Nearly half of millennials surveyed in a recent Bank of America report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> (43%–45%) said they expected to buy a house in the suburbs.

And as the suburbs have ballooned, they look a lot less like Leave It to Beaver. The populations of big American suburbs are now more diverse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> than the broader US population, according to Brookings.

Bottom line: The WFH-enabled rise of the suburbs may serve as a wake-up call <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to cities, where, in the case of NYC, 26 Empire State Buildings’-worth of office space now sits empty. According to Stanford’s Nicholas Bloom, the typical office worker is spending $2,000–$4,600 less annually in city centers.

​​ Turkish election is headed for a runoff. In the country’s most consequential election in a generation, neither the authoritarian-leaning incumbent, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, nor his challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu eclipsed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wI?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> the 50% threshold needed for victory, so the two men will likely square off in a runoff scheduled for May 28. If it’s anything like yesterday’s first round, it will be tense: Both candidates said the others’ vote counts were not to be trusted.

Sweden wins Eurovision. The Eurovision-obsessed country took home the top prize with Loreen’s performance of the power ballad “Tattoo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wJ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301>.” An estimated 160+ million people tuned into the famously over-the-top singing event, which took place in Liverpool, England, on behalf of last year’s winner, Ukraine (the show featured numerous tributes to Ukraine). Sweden’s win means it’ll host next year’s competition on the 50th anniversary of the most iconic Eurovision performance of all time: ABBA singing “Waterloo.”

Ja Morant suspended again. The Memphis Grizzlies star has been suspended <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wK?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> from all team activities after he appeared to be holding a gun on an Instagram livestream this weekend. It’s the second time in just over two months that Morant was suspended for seeming to hold a gun in a social media video. After the first incident, in March, Morant was suspended for eight games and lost out on $668,000 of his salary. When returning from that suspension, Morant said he sought counseling to help him better deal with stress.

Five years ago yesterday, the Supreme Court lifted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wM?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> a federal ban on sports gambling in the US, spawning a multibillion-dollar industry that’s transformed how Americans watch, talk about, and experience sports.

We plucked five numbers from the sports betting world to highlight five years of legalization.

$95 billion: That’s how much Americans bet on sports in legal jurisdictions with consumer protections last year, Sportico reported. It’s more money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wN?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> than the amount spent on ride sharing, coffee, and streaming.

71%: Two sports betting companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, control more than 70% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wO?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> of the US market, per gambling analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik. But despite taking in ~10% of wagers, these companies have struggled to turn a profit. FanDuel recorded its first quarterly profit last year, and DraftKings has yet to report a profitable quarter.

33: That’s the number of states, not including Washington, DC, that currently have legal sports betting. Another four states have legalized sports wagering, but don’t have any sportsbooks operating yet.

3: The three most-populous US states—California, Texas, and Florida—have not legalized sports gambling. They account for 26% of all teams in the major North American pro leagues, according to Axios.

45%: The number of women joining sportsbook apps jumped 45% last year, marking the third straight year that new women users exceeded men. Plus, the amount bet on women’s sports in 2022 increased 61% annually on DraftKings.

Quote: “I do not understand what is happening but I am incomprehensibly grateful to bigolas dickolas.”

It’s quite reasonable that writer Amal El-Mohtar doesn’t understand what is happening, because it is strange. A book she co-authored in 2019, This is How You Lose the Time War, has shot up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31480644.2876301> to the top 10 on Amazon’s bestseller list thanks to a tweet by an account called Bigolas Dickolas Wolfwood.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even win over your neighbor’s cat.

The financial dangers of looking on the sunny side. Spring is here, the sun is shining—and new research shows that’s likely to affect the stock market. A study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> that examined the weather’s impact on Chinese investors’ behavior in auction-style secondary equity offerings found that on days investors needed sunglasses, they were more optimistic and less risk-averse, driving bidding up and discounts down. Even one standard deviation in either sunshine intensity or duration made a noticeable difference. This adds to previous studies that found sunlight is associated with higher market returns and that fall and winter IPOs get priced lower.

Learn how to catcall more effectively. Cats are notoriously fickle, but French scientists have determined the best way to call <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> an unfamiliar cat to you and actually get it to come is by using a combination of audio and visual cues (rather than just one or the other). If you have to pick just one, a purely visual summoning gets a quicker feline response than a solely vocal one. The researchers discovered all this by testing out techniques on kitties from a cat cafe.

Get ready for Smell-O-Vision. One quick way to tell whether you’re in a VR simulation or the real world is to ask yourself whether things have scents. But that might change now that scientists have developed more efficient systems for integrating smell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ux?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> into the virtual world. Previous efforts involved messy aerosols and bulked-up headsets, but the new scent delivery method works by heating wax, so the user needs just a small under-nose patch or soft mask. The researchers have made 30 smells so far, including stinky durian fruit, and testers identifying them had a 93% success rate.—AR

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  How tech CEOs learned to hate remote work <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> Zuckerberg over zoom with office window in background <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781>Michael M. Santiago/New York Times Staff/Getty Images Can you guess what “one of the tech industry’s worst mistakes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6u_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781>” is, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman?

It’s not Quibi. It’s buying into the idea that 100% remote work wouldn’t cost startups creativity, as he recently said at an event organized by payment company Stripe.

The OpenAI CEO is the latest tech exec to argue that an 8:57am wake-up call and leisurely cold brew in bed might not be the optimal Tuesday morning routine for tech workers, despite many leaders having once hailed WFH as the way of the future.

Then vs. now

When the pandemic shut down the world, many tech leaders were quick to proclaim a permanent WFH revolution. But now, one after another, Silicon Valley bosses are trading remote work evangelism for remote work frustration, citing productivity concerns.

Here are a few examples.

Meta: In May 2020, Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6v0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> he wanted to mold Facebook into “the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale.” In the first months of the pandemic, he said employees could apply to make their job permanently remote and predicted that half of the company could work off-site in 5–10 years.

Fast forward to 2023: Zuck is saying that in-person engineers “get more done” and that Meta is reevaluating its distributed team approach.

Salesforce: In 2021, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff was seemingly at peace with the idea of never again seeing his company’s glitzy SF skyscraper bustling with workers. “They’re mostly at home, and that’s fine,” he said then.

Now, it might not be fine after all: Late last year, he wondered in an internal Slack if the “much lower productivity” of employees hired during the pandemic is “a reflection of our office policy,” according to CNBC.

What changed?

The US is experiencing the biggest decline in worker productivity since 1948, according to research from EY-Parthenon, and many executives have been quick to single out remote work as the main culprit.

This is what they cite to prove their point.

* A study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> published in Nature Human Behaviour found that working remotely made Microsoft’s remote workers miss important learning opportunities by not rubbing elbows with coworkers who aren’t part of their immediate team.

* More recent research <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> showed that interacting through a screen can make workers less likely to generate ideas. That’s a problem for tech companies needing to out-innovate the competition.

For many industry leaders, accessing a wider talent pool outside of traditional tech hubs isn’t enough to make up for those drawbacks. And as widespread labor shortages subside and layoffs sweep through Silicon Valley, companies are no longer in a perk war to recruit and retain the brightest minds.

Zoom out: The Big Tech office push mirrors broader white-collar labor market dynamics. In December, 13% of LinkedIn postings were for remote jobs, compared to 20% nine months prior.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Milwaukee’s haunted hotel Pfister Hotel on September 20, 2014 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Raymond Boyd/Getty Images It’s a big universe out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Los Angeles Dodgers star outfielder Mookie Betts isn’t spooked by a 100 mph fastball…but he sure as heck is scared of ghosts.

When his team traveled to Milwaukee last week to play the Brewers, Betts declined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uO?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> to stay at the downtown Pfister Hotel with the rest of the Dodgers and opted to shack up with some friends at an Airbnb instead.

Why? Because the 130-year-old Pfister Hotel is allegedly haunted by the apparition of its founder, Charles Pfister. And, while it’s unclear whether Pfister’s ghost is on the Brewers payroll (designated specter?), he’s relished the opportunity to disturb visiting baseball players who’ve stayed there.

* In 2001, visiting player Adrián Beltré said his TV inexplicably kept turning off and on, and he heard unexplained knocking on his door, according to Sports Illustrated. He ended up getting just two hours of sleep in three nights.

* Eight MLB players, including Bryce Harper and Giancarlo Stanton, reported spooky experiences <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uP?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781> when staying at the Pfister. “From the minute I walk in there, I’m freaked out,” Justin Upton told ESPN.

When its founder isn’t conducting psychological warfare against baseball players, the Pfister Hotel is considered one of the nicest hotels in Milwaukee and a historic landmark <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6uQ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31465963.3277781>. Every US president since William McKinley has stayed at the Pfister, and Elvis Presley checked in just four months before he died, according to WUWM.—NF

Good morning. The Social Security Administration released its list of the most popular baby names for 2022, and Liam and Olivia continued their reigns as the top names for boys and girls, respectively.

But look at the fastest-rising names, and you’ll see the impact of pop culture. Dutton, popularized in the TV Western Yellowstone, moved up the most spots of any name, jumping 986 spots from 2021 to No. 835 this year.

Hopefully the Duttons will fare better than all the poor Khaleesis out there.

Musk taps ad exec as new Twitter CEO <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Linda Yaccarino photo in Twitter logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vS?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images
It’s gotta be a culture shock to leave a multinational media conglomerate for a place that automatically replies to press requests with a poop emoji. Elon Musk announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> yesterday that NBCUniversal’s former chair of global advertising and partnerships Linda Yaccarino will succeed him as Twitter CEO, despite coming from the media world Musk despises.

Who is Yaccarino? She’s a heavyweight in the advertising industry, nicknamed “the velvet hammer” for her negotiating tactics. She formally announced leaving NBCUniversal yesterday after spending the last 11 years at the company. Yaccarino backed Musk’s professed views on free speech when she interviewed him onstage at a conference in Miami last month.

Yaccarino brings something Twitter has desperately lacked since Musk took over: credibility with advertisers. When Musk took over the platform, ad sales brought in more than 90% of Twitter’s revenue, but after a shaky takeover, advertisers bounced.

Monthly ad revenue from Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers dropped from roughly $127 million in October 2022 (the month Musk bought the company) to $48 million in January 2023, according to digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower.

Musk tried to replace some of those lost dollars by making people pay for their blue check marks with Twitter Blue, but that flopped. If Musk really wants to turn Twitter into an “everything app <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vU?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>,” a good place to start is getting the best in the biz to bring back advertisers.

Looking ahead…Musk will move over to the CTO and executive chairman positions, and Yaccarino isn’t necessarily set up for success. Becoming the CEO of Twitter kinda feels like inheriting a beautiful Victorian house that is rapidly flooding because every single pipe has been intentionally smashed by the previous owner. Also, a bunch of angry people (some wearing badges!) currently live there.

She’s got her work cut out for her wooing companies: Just yesterday, Twitter removed its autocomplete suggestion function after NBC reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6vV?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> the app was suggesting animal abuse videos to anyone typing “dog” or “cat” into the search bar.—MM

Jerome Powell may get a new No. 2. President Biden said yesterday that he would nominate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6v-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> economist Philip Jefferson, who is already on the Fed’s board, to become second-in-command at the central bank, replacing Lael Brainard. He also plans to nominate the current US rep to the World Bank, Adriana Kugler, to an empty board seat. She would be the Fed’s first Latina governor. If confirmed by the Senate, the pair will jump into their new roles as the Fed continues to try to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, so no pressure there.

Border update: The expiration of Title 42, the policy that allowed the US to expel migrants seeking asylum on public health grounds, was followed by relative calm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wt?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> at the southern border yesterday after border crossing surged earlier in the week. But the Biden Administration is facing legal challenges to its current border policies from both the right and left that could determine what happens next, including one where Florida and other Republican-led states won an order Thursday forbidding the US from releasing migrants without court dates for two weeks.

Prosecutors chalked her motives up to “money, power, and sex,” while her attorneys claimed she was led astray by cultlike beliefs—including that the two children were turned into zombies by bad spirits and that she was a goddess who would trigger the apocalypse. She now faces the possibility of life in prison when she is sentenced.

Turkey heads to the polls tomorrow to decide whether to send its strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into retirement. Erdoğan faces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w1?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> the biggest threat yet in the 20 years he’s led the country: His opponent, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, is slightly ahead in the polls.

The two politicians are selling wildly different visions for the nation with the second largest army in NATO, and it looks like democracy itself is on the ballot. Given that Turkey is a major trade and geopolitical partner for the US, the EU, and Russia, it’s no wonder that political pundits, investors, and newsletter writers are all watching closely as its citizens choose its future.

Kılıçdaroğlu leads the chorus of critics accusing Erdoğan of governing like an authoritarian and blaming his unorthodox policy choices for the country’s runaway inflation. He’s branded himself as a secular, democracy-first alternative to the religious, traditionalist incumbent.

Erdoğan is wooing voters with promises to replicate the economic boom Turkey experienced earlier in his tenure, even as the nation rebuilds from the devastating earthquake that threatened his popularity. He’s also leaning on conservative, family, and religious values.

Looking ahead…there likely won’t be a clear winner tomorrow, setting up a second voting round for later this month. And some political scientists are worried Erdoğan won’t concede the election even if he loses.—SK

Swifties haven’t been this disappointed since the release of ‘ME!’ <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Best seller sticker with Taylor Swift's face over picture of BTS members <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> Morning Brew/Image: Getty Images
Yesterday, the publishing world crushed Swifties’ dreams when it was revealed that an unpublished, untitled book believed to be a Taylor Swift memoir was, in fact, not <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>.

The hype surrounding the potential Swift tell-all shot the book up to No. 2 on Amazon’s bestseller list this week, forcing Flatiron Books to announce the real author of the book, K-pop band BTS, a month earlier than planned.

What made people think Swift wrote it? Swifties love a conspiracy. Amazon listed the book as 4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023 Hardcover by “Flatiron Author to be Revealed July 2023.” Fans found a number of Easter eggs pointing to Swift in the book’s few known details. For example, the digits in the number of pages (544) adds up to Swift’s lucky number (5+4+4=13.) And the book’s release date, July 9, is 1) mentioned in her song “Last Kiss” and 2) close to July 7, the date that Taylor’s version of Speak Now is set to be released.

But…July 9, 2023, also marks the 10-year anniversary of the founding of an equally adoring fanbase: ARMY <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6w7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558>. The book, actually titled, Beyond the Story: 10-Year Record of BTS, is now No. 1 on the Amazon and Barnes & Nobles bestseller lists.—CC

It’s the nationwide florist’s biggest floral delivery day of the year, accounting for 10% of its annual revenue and trumping Valentine’s Day which brings in ~9%.

In addition to knowing what guilty pleasure song you secretly play on repeat, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek knows what people are talking about…or at least what people with podcasts are. Ek tweeted Thursday that he checked his company’s data <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6wc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31470502.99558> and the number of daily podcast episodes about AI has spiked 500% over the last 30 days.

But no one will have to bring their car back to the shop: Tesla will push an over-the-air software fix to the vehicles.

Good morning. Looks like Twitter is finally getting a new CEO. Current boss Elon Musk tweeted yesterday that he found his replacement to lead Twitter and that she’ll be starting as CEO in six weeks, while he’ll move aside to oversee product.

So, who could it be? Well, it’d have to be someone with a strong business background who has experience staring down trolls and working in a tumultuous environment: Shoshanna Shapiro from Girls.

Zelda is back and bigger than ever Scene from Zelda Nintendo
If your gamer friends go MIA this weekend, they’re probably answering the call to take up arms as the Hero of Hyrule in the most anticipated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> video game release of the year: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, out today.

It’s a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), the flagship Nintendo Switch game that gave a jolt to the slumping video game console market. Nintendo said Breath of the Wild sold almost 30 million copies—more than all <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> of the previous 3D installments in the franchise’s four-decade history combined, Wired reports.

It looks like Tears of the Kingdom could surpass its predecessor. The game is about two gigabytes bigger than Breath of the Wild and $10 more expensive in its digital edition, making it the Switch’s largest and priciest Nintendo game, per GameSpot.

What’s all the hype?

The Zelda hive is BIG. The Reddit group devoted to the world of Zelda has 2.1 million members compared to just 147,000 in r/Mario, and it far outstrips r/CallOfDuty and r/gtaonline, two powerhouse video game franchises.

With such a rabid fanbase, Zelda has pushed beyond the borders of its land, Hyrule, and into broader pop culture.

Its characters have been referenced in mainstream media like The Simpsons, How I Met Your Mother, My Little Pony, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

ASAP Mob, Rejjie Snow, and Chance the Rapper have all sampled sound effects specific to the Zelda games in songs.

Fun fact: Zelda was Robin Williams’s favorite video game franchise, so much so that he named his only daughter Zelda.

Big picture: While The Legend of Zelda has been adored by gamers since the original 8-bit Link slashed moblins on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986, Breath of the Wild revolutionized open-world gaming and invited a wave of new and younger players to join the die-hards.

Tears of the Kingdom is expected to capitalize on the last installment’s momentum by picking up where its predecessor left off, but with a bigger map, more creative gameplay, and a brand-new campaign to beat.—ML

+ More on Zelda: Molly went way deeper into what this game release means for Zelda, Nintendo, and all of you in a longer article. Read it here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254>.

Tour de headlines In an aerial view, immigrants seeking asylum in the United States wait in line near the border fence to be processed by U.S. Border Patrol agents Mario Tama/Getty Images
All eyes in the southern border as Title 42 ends. The Covid-era policy that allowed US authorities to quickly deport migrants expired <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ri?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> at 11:59pm last night, and it’s expected to result in a spike in border crossings that the US is likely not prepared to handle. 60,000 people were waiting near the border to enter the US yesterday, though Border Patrol is already far beyond capacity with 25,000 migrants in custody, the BBC reported. The Biden administration has replaced Title 42 with other policies intended to stem illegal crossings.

Peloton recalls 2.2 million of its bikes. If you bought a Peloton bike in the US between January 2018 and May 2023, you should stop using it and contact Peloton for a free repair, the company said yesterday. Peloton found that the bike’s seat post can break <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rj?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> while you’re riding, which can lead to injury. This recall is the fourth Peloton has issued for its exercise products in the past several years and weighed down its already beat-down stock.

WORK

Surprise: People like their jobs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Graph showing share of people who are satisfied in their jobs from 1987-2023 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254>
The Conference Board released new data <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> showing that 62.3% of US workers are satisfied with their job, the highest share since the business research organization started the survey in 1987.

What’s behind the newfound satisfaction? It’s not kombucha on tap, a yoga wellness retreat, or because next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day. Rather, resurgent employee happiness is mostly attributed to hybrid work arrangements, job flexibility, and the pandemic-induced tight labor market that has allowed people to leave jobs they hate for jobs they like (or at least hate less).

Note: The survey was conducted last November, before tech companies started mass layoffs.

But even worker satisfaction has a gender gap. Women were less satisfied <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rn?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> overall than men in each of the 26 categories surveyed, including leave policies, promotions, and culture. The biggest gap was in job security: 68.7% of men felt satisfied with their level of job security, compared to 61.8% of women.

It’s unclear how the potential economic downturn would affect worker satisfaction. If the labor market cools off significantly, employees will be less able to ditch jobs they’re unhappy with as companies lamp down on hiring.—CC

Could Beyoncé make more than T. Swift on her tour? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Beyonce performing in Sweden <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
This week in Sweden, Beyoncé returned to the stage solo for the first time in seven years for the start of her 56-stop Renaissance World Tour. Don’t worry, we’re not about to spoil the set list.

Stressed-out pop fans have shelled out a lot of money in the last six months for tickets to two mega stadium tours: Bey’s and Taylor Swift’s. Tickets for each tour are averaging $700 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254>, professor and VC Peter Cohan estimates. But with Beyoncé now joining Swift on the road, the race to earn $1 billion on a single tour has begun in earnest.

No tour has ever brought in $1 billion

Elton John’s nine-legged (and still counting) Yellow Brick Road farewell tour is the best-selling tour ever, grossing $800 million as of February.

But if anyone can hit nine zeroes, it’s the two queens of pop.

Cohan estimates that the Renaissance Tour could bring in anywhere from $275 million to $2.4 billion in gross ticket sales based on venues, contract terms, and Bey’s previous concert income.

On the top end of that range, that’d be far more than Taylor Swift’s expected $500–$600 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rt?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> haul, per Bloomberg's estimates—but that’s before any overseas T. Swift shows have been announced.

Bottom line: With Bruce Springsteen, the Grateful Dead, and Blink 182 packing stadiums along with T. Swift and Beyoncé, this year could be the biggest ever for live music, according to Bloomberg.—MM

Key performance indicators dozens of Empire State Buildings Francis Scialabba
Stat: How much empty office space does New York City have right now? Enough to fill more than 26 Empire State Buildings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6rx?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31457418.2802254> (about 74.6 million square feet, if you want to be specific). Researchers Edward Glaeser and Carlo Ratti made the comparison to emphasize how NYC and other large American cities need to make drastic changes to their zoning laws to adapt to the WFH era. The ultimate goal: become a “Playground City” where people live, work, and play all in the same neighborhood.

Following the interview, in which Trump repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, CNN was roasted by people both outside and inside the network for giving Trump a platform to air obvious lies. Licht countered that the town hall highlighted the importance of the 2024 election: “People woke up, and they know what the stakes are in this election in a way that they didn’t the day before,” he said.

IMMIGRATION

US braces for border chaos as Title 42 expires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6n_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> People standing at the US-Mexico border <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6n_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images
Today marks the end of the US Public Health Emergency for Covid-19. And when it expires tonight, so does the controversial immigration policy Title 42.

What is Title 42? A public health policy that went into effect in March 2020 that allowed US Border Patrol to turn away migrants seeking asylum to prevent the further spread of Covid. Title 42 received criticism from the ACLU and other advocacy organizations for using public health as a pretext for keeping immigrants out of the country. Border regulations will now revert to pre-pandemic rules permitting asylum-seekers to stay in the US while their cases are processed.

Why is it expiring? Title 42 was only legal because of the national public health emergency. Now that the Biden administration is ending the emergency, Title 42 has no legal basis.

Authorities anticipate an immigration surge

Officials expect those who attempted to make it into the US during Title 42 could try again, knowing that they can’t be turned away so easily. The following places have already declared a state of emergency:

Brownsville, El Paso, and Laredo, Texas. In El Paso, an estimated 2,300 people are living on the streets because shelters are at maximum capacity.

Chicago. The self-proclaimed “sanctuary city” saw more than 8,000 migrants arrive in the past year.

Two New York counties. The counties each declared a separate state of emergency after NYC Mayor Eric Adams said he wanted to send migrants to hotels in the suburbs.

Looking ahead…1,500 additional troops sent by the Biden administration have started to arrive at the border. The president is also expanding legal avenues into the US for migrants. But whether or not the federal government has an adequate plan to handle the increase in migrants at the border remains to be seen.—CC

George Santos charged with crimes of dishonesty <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6nr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> George Santos appeared in federal court on Wednesday. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6nr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> Tom Williams / Getty Images
After being dragged in the court of public opinion for deceiving voters about his qualifications and personal connection to 9/11, Rep. George Santos’s alleged aversion to the truth got him indicted on 13 financial crimes yesterday. The congressman pleaded not guilty.

If convicted, the New York lawmaker could get more than 20 years in prison <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6ns?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> for wire fraud alone, in addition to the sentences potentially carried by money laundering, theft of public funds, and—perhaps least surprisingly—lying to the House of Representatives.

According to federal prosecutors, Santos allegedly:

Solicited campaign donations that ended up in his pocket, including tens of thousands of dollars used to pay off debts, give money to associates, and foot the bill for designer clothes (très chic).

Falsely claimed unemployment in the summer of 2020 to get $24,000 in pandemic-era benefits. He was reportedly employed at the time at Florida-based investment firm Harbor City Capital…which the SEC shut down in 2021 for being a “classic Ponzi scheme.”

Failed to mention those unemployment benefits or earnings from Harbor City on congressional financial disclosure forms.

Where does this leave Congress? Santos says he won’t resign and has even pledged to run for reelection. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he would not support the reelection bid, but he’s not calling for Santos to resign—yet. He said he would do so if the House Ethics Committee finds Santos broke the law.—ML

The world got a peek at what exactly the Googleplex team (or what’s left of it after the 12,000-person layoff in January) has been working on at Google’s yearly developer conference, Google I/O, yesterday.

The biggest news came from the AI department: Google announced its new AI model, PaLM 2, which will power its leveled-up Bard chatbot. PaLM 2 was trained on academic papers and 100+ languages.

And it may be the future <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6o6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> of search: Instead of gathering up a bunch of links (sponsored and just plain popular), answers to queries will be written by Google’s AI and will appear at the top of the page for some searches, the company said.

The update will roll out to just a few users at first but could signal a radical change <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6o7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31442606.2893853> for publishers.

Here are some other highlights:

Google’s first foldable phone. The highly anticipated Google Pixel Fold will hit shelves in late June with a whopping $1,799 price tag. Google also launched its first Pixel Tablet and new Pixel 7a smartphone (neither folds, though).

Get lost in 3D. Google Maps will add an “Immersive View” for routes in select cities where users can see a 3D view of their route with features like a traffic simulation, bike lane demarcations, and parking info.

MEDIA

Americans don't agree on what news to trust <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Turning on TV gif <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gc?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
“In the media we only sometimes trust” could be America’s motto, according to the results of a YouGov poll <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> released yesterday. The April survey shows extreme polarization in how much folks trust 45 different news outlets.

CNN and MSNBC are the most divisive media orgs: A much larger share of Democrats than Republicans think they’re in the business of telling the truth. Winning over Democrats may be the easier task: The survey shows they're more likely to trust the media in general—they’re even more likely than Republicans to have faith in the conservative-leaning New York Post.

And, in some good news for the brave souls who report from the eye of the storm, the most trusted news source overall is The Weather Channel, followed by PBS and the BBC. Meanwhile, only a handful of ultra-distrusted publications, including Breitbart News, The Daily Caller and InfoWars, have more skeptics than believers, per the survey.

What this means for TV

The lack of trust likely isn’t helping cable news ratings. CNN and Fox News, enjoying the trust of just 40% and 38% of the public, respectively, are struggling to convince viewers to tune in.

CNN had a 61% drop in prime-time viewership in March compared with a year earlier, as it attempts to reinvent itself under new management.

Fox lost 29.6% of its prime-time audience in the week after it dismissed its most popular on-air personality, Tucker Carlson, in the wake of a defamation scandal with a $787.5 million legal settlement.

But at least the two TV behemoths have less of a credibility problem to worry about than TikTok, which ranked as the most distrusted social media platform in the survey—even among younger adults. Meanwhile, LinkedIn is the only social media site with a greater share of folks trusting it than not.

Looking ahead…the situation might be improving: Media skepticism overall has declined in recent months compared to a similar YouGov survey from last year.—SK

WORLD

Tour de headlines House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images
The debt ceiling dance is on. President Biden is scheduled to meet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> today with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders to negotiate over raising the debt limit (and thereby avert economic catastrophe). The two sides are coming into the negotiations far apart: Biden says it should be raised with no conditions, while Republicans have vowed only to raise it in exchange for steep spending cuts. The clock is ticking as the US is expected to run out of money to pay all its bills as of June, but today’s meeting is not expected to produce a final result.

Meat prices are coming down. It’s good news for anyone whose regular pizza order is the meat lovers, but bad news for Tyson Foods, which reported a surprise $97 million quarterly loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gi?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> yesterday (sending its stock down 16%). The company said that it’s still facing higher prices for feed and livestock, but can’t pass the extra costs to consumers because of waning demand. Its average sale price dropped 10.3% for pork and 5.4% for beef last quarter.

The Army terminated Texas mall shooter after three months. As authorities continued to investigate the motives and white supremacist views of the shooter who killed eight people at a Texas outlet mall over the weekend, military officials told news outlets yesterday that he had been discharged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gj?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> from the US Army in 2008 due to a mental health issue after just three months and did not complete training. The shooter, who was killed by police during the attack, purchased the guns he used through legal private sales that did not require background checks, but this type of discharge would not come up in checks.

TRAVEL

Biden wants airlines to pay you back for travel headaches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gk?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> New rules would give customers cash back for flight cancellations. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gk?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Hannah Minn
Good news for weary travelers: The Biden administration is writing new rules that would require cash compensation for flyers when airlines are responsible for a cancellation or lengthy delay.

This will be a first for US-based airlines: Refunds for canceled flights are federally required, but no major carrier offers extra cash for the inconvenience. Only JetBlue and Alaska Airlines guarantee compensation beyond a refund of any kind—and it’s in the form of frequent flyer miles or vouchers.

Air travel complaints have quadrupled in recent years, with the majority coming from travelers trying to get refunds. And for good reason: Transportation Department figures attribute almost 80% of cancellations from the first half of 2022 to airline mismanagement like crew shortages, craft maintenance, or late-arriving planes. Those kinds of situations would warrant compensation in addition to a refund under the Biden administration’s planned rules <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933>.

Airlines would also be required to cover meals, transportation, and hotels during flight disruptions, which most (except Frontier) started doing voluntarily after last summer’s nightmare travel season. Experts predict this summer could be even worse, but the new rules could take months or even years to implement.

Until then…travelers can use the Transportation Department’s newly expanded customer service dashboard <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> to see what each airline offers for delays or cancellations.—ML

‘Quiet luxury’ is fashion’s biggest trend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Kendall, Shiv, and Roman Roy in a scene from "Succession" <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> Claudette Barius/HBO
Succession has taken over the internet with its memes, crafty Machiavellian insults, and Kendall Roy obsessives. And now it’s taking over your closet with “quiet luxury.”

Thanks in part to the show’s cashmere baseball caps <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933>, quiet luxury is surging: The term surpassed 35 billion views on TikTok.

What is it? Many in the fashion industry are defining quiet luxury much like the Supreme Court defined obscenity in 1964: You know it when you see it. It’s well-tailored clothing made from expensive fabrics in neutral colors and logo-free—think bespoke.

Why now? Seeing Succession characters as fashion inspo is part of it, but so is the looming possibility of a recession: Quiet luxury last had a resurgence in 2008. While the economy grapples with banking turmoil, Big Tech layoffs, and interest rate hikes, flashy styles—like a neon Balenciaga bodysuit—are just not it. Instead, quiet luxury <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> insists on quality. According to brand research firm Edited, “Quiet luxury provides investment pieces with a year-round appeal that offers consumers a good cost-per-wear return.”

Style trickles down: This Spring/Summer season’s lines saw the use of premium materials, like pima cotton and merino wool, up 32% year over year, according to Edited, proving the impact of quiet luxury on the mass market. Expect to see more accessible retailers turn to elevated basics.—CC

Stat: While some people have so much pasta they just dump it in the woods of New Jersey, over in Italy, surging pasta prices are interfering with la dolce vita. The Italian government has scheduled crisis talks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> for this Thursday to address the soaring cost of noodles, which jumped 17.5% year over year in March even as wheat prices fell. Inflation is high in Italy, but not that high: Overall consumer prices rose by 8.1% in the same month.

Quote: “Great win for the Suns last night in an amazing series so far! That should be and is the only story.”

To the great debates of our time—like Coke or Pepsi and whether Han shot first—we can now add the question of whether Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia was fouled or flopped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/6gx?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31417769.2886933> during his team’s game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. Nuggets star Nikola Jokić got a technical foul for “deliberately” making contact with Ishbia as he tried to wrest a ball that had sailed into the crowd from him—but it looked to many like Ishbia exaggerated his response to that contact. Either way, Ishbia’s ready to bury the hatchet before Game 5 of the series: He tweeted yesterday that he didn’t want Jokić suspended or fined.

Hollywood braces for writers’ strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> Snowy mountains fill the landscape behind the Hollywood sign. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> Patrick T. Fallon / Getty Images
If production companies and unionized writers don’t reach a new contract by midnight tonight, the scribes will put down their No. 2 pencils and strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> for the first time in 15 years.

The stalemate reflects how streaming has upended TV and film, with writers feeling like they aren’t seeing any of the plusses from the emergence of all the plusses.

Depending on how long the strike lasts (if it does happen), it could send Hollywood into a deep freeze: Series might go off the air, productions might get delayed, more reality shows would flood the airwaves, and the California economy could lose billions.

What are the writers’ gripes?

They argue that Hollywood’s pivot to streaming worsened their working conditions and made it hard to earn a middle-class income as a writer. Here’s why…

Shorter series: In the previous TV era, shows like How I Met Your Mother reliably churned out seasons with 20+ episodes. Now, streamers are prioritizing seasons with eight-to-12 episodes.

Residuals: Historically, if you had a writing credit on a TV show and that show was aired as a rerun, you’d earn a royalty payment known as a residual. Streaming has disrupted that income stream.

Mini rooms: In the streaming age, writers often work in “mini rooms” where they crank out scripts at low wages for shows that may or may not be made.

So, there’s a lot of frustration. Last month, 97.85% of eligible members of the Writers Guild of America, which represents most of the working writers in Hollywood, voted to authorize a strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5V7?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> if an agreement with major studios wasn’t reached. That’s the most support for a work stoppage in the union’s history.

What happens if they strike? Studios have been stockpiling scripts ahead of the May 1 deadline, so scripted TV shows would continue for awhile. But late-night shows and other topical programs like SNL could be impacted almost immediately.

During the last strike, which lasted 100 days from 2007–2008, Conan O’Brien filled the airtime by seeing how long he could spin his wedding ring. More importantly, it cost the LA economy over $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.

Tour de headlines Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein on a private plane Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein on a private plane. US Attorney's Office SDNY.
Jeffrey Epstein’s private calendar shows meetings with bigwigs. The late, disgraced financier had meetings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Vb?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> with the future top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, the future director of the CIA, professor Noam Chomsky, and other prominent individuals years after he became a convicted sex offender. That’s according to the WSJ, which reviewed Epstein’s schedules and emails that show the arranged meetings. When asked by the WSJ why they planned to meet with Epstein, most of these people “told the Journal they visited Epstein for reasons related to his wealth and connections,” the paper said.

Biden also pressed for the release of other Americans detained abroad, including freelancer Austin Tice and former Marine Paul Whelan. As part of his comedy set, Biden poked fun at his age <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Vd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310>, blasted Fox News, and took a swipe at fired CNN host Don Lemon.

According to police, neighbors approached this man and asked him to stop shooting his gun in his backyard because they had an infant who was trying to sleep. The man got upset after hearing this, and walked into their house and killed five of them, including an eight-year-old, with an AR-15-style rifle, police said. The FBI special agent in charge acknowledged authorities have “zero leads” about where the suspect is hiding.

US financial regulators just executed the banking version of a house flip. Authorities seized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5VB?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> First Republic Bank this morning and sold most of its assets to JPMorgan, the country’s largest bank.

First Republic Bank’s collapse marks the second-biggest banking failure in US history, topping Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in March. Like SVB, First Republic is a midsized California-based lender with a specific client base—in this case, wealthy individuals—that made it particularly exposed to the shockwaves of the recent banking turmoil.

First Republic tried to weather the storm itself, but after customers withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits in Q1 and its share price plunged nearly 75% last week alone, the government had to hang the “closed” sign on the door.

But by quickly finding a buyer over the weekend, the government avoided what it had to do for SVB: Protect deposits over the federally insured cap of $250,000. JPMorgan said it will assume First Republic’s $92 billion in deposits, which is a welcome outcome since making SVB depositors whole cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund about $20 billion.

Big picture: This government-brokered acquisition is just the latest in a series of bigger banks swallowing failing, smaller banks at a discount this spring. First Citizens collected the scraps of SVB, New York Community Bank snatched up assets of Signature Bank, and UBS absorbed crosstown rival Credit Suisse.

CALENDAR

The week ahead Mike Coppola/Getty Images
Met Gala: One of the most exclusive parties in the world pops off tonight at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Did we mention it was exclusive? Individual tickets are reportedly going for $50,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Vk?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> and a table costs $300,000—but even shelling out that kind of dough won’t guarantee you an invite, because Met Gala mastermind and Vogue editor Anna Wintour must give her blessing to every attendee. This year’s theme: fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld.

Fed meeting: With inflation still ripping, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its 10th straight interest rate hike at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. It’s possible the Fed could hit pause after this one.

The coronation of Charles: On Saturday, King Charles III will become the 40th monarch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Vl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> crowned at Westminster Abbey since 1066. The ceremony will involve all types of rituals, many of them religious in nature, but it does not make Charles the king—he became the monarch after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died last year.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit the milestone yesterday, 26 days after its release. It’s in rare company: The film, from Illumination and Universal, is the fifth movie since the Covid pandemic began to hit the threshold and the 10th animated movie ever to gross $1 billion.

Twitter’s former CEO Jack Dorsey is not impressed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5VF?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31331890.3294310> with how the current CEO is running the ship. Writing on Bluesky, the Twitter rival he helped create, Dorsey said that Musk should’ve backed out of the deal and that the board shouldn’t have forced him to buy it. It’s a total 180 from last year, when Dorsey said Musk was “the singular solution I trust” to lead the company. Bluesky, meanwhile, got a lot of buzz last week after prominent folks like AOC, Dril, and Chrissy Teigen joined the platform.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even make your parrot feel less alone.

Polly wanna FaceTime? Parrots, for one species, don’t think Zoom happy hours are cringe. A new study had parrot owners in the US teach their feathered pets to use tablets to make video calls. And just like humans in the early days of lockdown, the birds felt less lonely <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> when they could virtually hang out with one another. The parrots could choose who they wanted to ring, and the popular birds turned out to be the ones who initiated the most calls.

Hot off the press: stick-on vaccines. Researchers at MIT have created a new type of tabletop printer that spits out vaccine doses on demand in the form of thumbnail-size microneedle patches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>. Once scaled, this mobile technology could produce hundreds of doses per day, revolutionizing pandemic response. And in a boon for warmer or more remote parts of the world, the vaccine patches can be stored at room temperature for months before they’re slapped on—no refrigeration or professional administering required.

It’s official: AI will make you more productive at work. The first real-world study of AI in the workplace just concluded after more than a year, and it confirmed what tech enthusiasts already believed: Using AI tools can significantly boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sn?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> employee productivity and save managers dozens of hours each week. Customer service agents at a Fortune 500 software company got their work done 14% faster with the help of generative AI tools, and new hires who used AI rivaled workers with more than six months of experience.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  The hottest esport is...chess <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5So?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> Man playing chess online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5So?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>goc/Getty Images What are the youths into these days? A centuries-old board game. Chess is the talk of recess but now, just like everything else, it’s happening online.

At the center of the frenzy is Chess.com, a site where folks can face off against each other or play against a bot (like the insolent cat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Sp?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> Mittens). It’s seen an influx of players since 2020 when many turned to the game of kings as a way to avoid pandemic lockdown boredom.

The game’s popularity during Covid was helped along by the Netflix miniseries The Queen’s Gambit, whose barrier-smashing, chess prodigy heroine inspired millions to play. But the latest chess boom is fueled not by Beth Harmon, but by influencers helping young people realize online chess can be just as fun as Minecraft and Fortnite.

Keeping chess in check at school

Schools nationwide are dealing with an epidemic of distracted kids sneakily playing matches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> on their phones during classes, according to the Washington Post. While some teachers have been confiscating phones, at least one teacher on Reddit said they are happy it’s chess the kids are into and not Andrew Tate.

Maxim Dlugy, who runs a Manhattan chess school, told us his student body has increased more than threefold, from about 200 to 700 since the start of the pandemic.

And Chess.com’s traffic has soared: The site’s servers crashed multiple times as its daily user count doubled from November 2022 to December 2022, and reached 12 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> this month, according to Polygon.

The sport was likely helped along last year by a perfect hype storm created by Magnus Carlsen, the world’s No. 1 chess player, accusing an opponent of cheating in an in-person game, as well as a Louis Vuitton campaign in which Messi and Ronaldo faced off across a chess board. But the biggest boost came from a cadre of influencers working to win over teens.

* The top chess streamers on Twitch have over a million followers each who are eager to see them play and break down their moves.

* TikTok videos with #chess have been viewed 11.6 billion times.

Unlike in the chess heydays of the last century, one need not be a Bobby Fischer-level genius to achieve chess stardom now. Though some chess influencers are among the best players on the planet, many are merely decent and make up for their lack of big-league skill with charisma.

One of the most popular chess YouTubers, Levy Rozman, is a pro, but he lacks the grandmaster designation of top-tier players. That doesn’t bother the 3.6 million followers who tune into his strategy tutorials and his breakdowns of the epic moments in famous chess matches played by others.

Embracing the esport

With the online game becoming dominant, the esport versions of rapid and blitz chess are increasingly getting professional buy-in. Carlsen said he’s taking a break from in-person matches until at least 2024 and will be focusing on online chess tournaments. He recently sold a chess app to Chess.com and announced this week that he’s starting a Fantasy Chess game (Carlsen is an elite fantasy soccer manager).

And the Champions Chess Tour, a series of online tournaments now hosted by Chess.com, features some of the biggest names in the sport, including Carlsen. The matches are time-limited to just a few minutes, similar to the ones amateurs play on Chess.com and influencers stream on Twitch.

The company hopes that the Champions Chess Tour will become the flagship event “for all of chess” in the future, a spokesperson for Chess.com told Morning Brew.

Looking ahead…some players like Carlsen and US champion Fabiano Caruana predict that hourslong IRL matches will get phased out as pro chess moves online and shorter games dominate.—SK

  Place to be: Westminster Abbey Westminster Abbey, London Tim Graham/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

On Saturday, King Charles III, like every British monarch since 1066, will be coronated at Westminster Abbey in London.

What is this place? It’s undoubtedly the most important church <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362> for the British monarchy, having hosted dozens of royal coronations, weddings, funerals, and other important ceremonies over its nearly 1,000-year history. Westminster Abbey hasn’t been the site of a coronation since Queen Elizabeth II’s in 1953, but it was the location of her funeral last year, Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997, and the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. 

In addition to hosting royal pomp and circumstance, Westminster Abbey has a number of, er, permanent installations, such as the interred bodies of some of the most notable figures in British history. Legendary artists such as writer Geoffrey Chaucer and composer George Frideric Handel are buried in a section known as Poets’ Corner. Charles Dickens was buried there, too, though he didn’t want to be <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SD?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>.

If you do want to be there, you’re probably into history, because Westminster Abbey is a great place to visit if you enjoy looking at really old things. There’s an old chair <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>, an old door <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SF?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>, and, currently en route from Scotland, an old stone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>. Westminster Abbey is typically open to the public, but it’s closed April 25–May 8 for reasons.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work Last week we asked: What not-necessarily-expensive item/service/etc. represents luxury to you?

* “A ceramic or glass butter dish/platter. Instantly elevates the butter game compared to scraping butter straight from the tub.”—Kevin from New York, NY

* “You definitely know someone has made it when you walk into their house and find an unusually large glass jar of pistachios that they willingly share with all visitors. I’ll get there someday.”—Ben from Heber City, UT

* “Pillars on the front of your house. When I was a kid, I always thought that pillars made your house a mansion.”—Tanya from Indiana

* “Tissues. Actual tissues and not just half-used rolls of toilet paper mean you’ve reached a kind of bougie status I’ll never be able to match.”—A.C. from California

* “Having several pairs of scissors in my house. Growing up, we only had one pair of long skinny scissors that were used for everything.”—Bonita from Vermont

This week’s question

Taking inspiration from Rob Walker’s newsletter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SH?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>, we want to know: What’s something you want to experience every single instance of? (For example, ordering every item on The Cheesecake Factory menu, etc.)

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I desperately want to try every state’s signature sandwich <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SI?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31317641.3274362>.

*Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 1:00am ET. Here's what these numbers mean. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/s1?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763>

Markets: Stocks rose yesterday, finishing strong to give the Dow its best month <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Up?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> since January. One that didn’t was First Republic, which tanked as rumors flew about its fate (more on that in just a moment).

Economy: For all the Fed watchers out there, new data released today sure makes it look like another rate hike could be in store next week. The data shows wages are still rising and one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures rose slightly last month.

Pour one out for First Republic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5US?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> A First Republic bank branch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5US?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> View Press/Getty Images
First Republic might be breathing its last breaths. Regulators are gearing up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UT?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> to take over the beleaguered regional lender, just like they did the two banks that failed last month, Reuters reported yesterday.

Officials spent the past few days huddling with financial institutions to come up with an action plan to prevent First Republic from becoming the latest bank meltdown headline. But there appear to be no private banks willing to help it raise more cash.

How’d we get here?

The bank panic that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left First Republic’s depositors worried about whether it could stay afloat. Like many regional banks, it invested depositor cash in assets that were devalued over the past year by rising interest rates.

First Republic got hit extra hard by the crisis because it successfully pursued wealthy clients in order to grow. But those same clients understood that, if the banking sector’s troubles seeped into First Republic, they wouldn’t be made whole by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as two-thirds of accounts at the bank had balances above the $250k insurance threshold.

Clients pulled more than $100 billion from their accounts in the first quarter of 2023, leaving First Republic with a 40% reduction in deposits.

Things calmed down after big banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America deposited $30 billion in the bank last month. Although this reassured customers, First Republic began to rack up interest fees on government rescue loans. And it reported dismal quarterly results this week.

Its stock has plummeted more than 70% since Monday, putting it at a 97% loss compared to the start of the year.

Looking ahead…if the bank fails, regulators will have some busy days ahead of them deciding whether to make First Republic depositors whole and assuring the public that the banking sector isn’t in trouble.—SK

The Fed says it’s time for new bank rules. Just in time for a new looming bank failure, the Federal Reserve issued a 102-page report dissecting the corpse of Silicon Valley Bank. The Fed pointed the finger at both its own inadequate supervision and the bank’s management. And in an accompanying letter, Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, called for <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UQ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> stricter rules to be applied to more financial institutions, as well as for more tools to be given to regulators to bring firms with poor capital planning and risk management into line.

North Carolina plays the reverse card on gerrymandering. The newly installed Republican majority on North Carolina’s Supreme Court took a look at the court’s recent precedents on voting rights and decided they’d rather go in a different direction <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UR?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763>. In two separate decisions yesterday, the court tossed out an earlier ruling that rejected Republican-drawn election maps and reinstated a voter ID law that the prior court had nixed as racially biased. A third ruling denied voting rights to people with some felony convictions.

Can Jack Dorsey make Twitter 2.0? So far, none of the social media platforms hyped as the big thing for those looking to replace Elon Musk’s Twitter have gained real traction, but the latest one, Bluesky, might have a bit of an edge—and not just because Chrissy Teigen has already joined. The app—which has much of the same functionality as the bird app and is so far only open to those with an invitation—has funding <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5UX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> from Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s founder. The twist is that the new app intends to be decentralized, meaning people will be able to create their own personalized communities within.

In the wake of the company’s bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond is closing all 360 of its locations (and all of its Buybuy Baby stores). But those giant, fluorescently lit buildings will be filled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ur?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> soon enough, as retail landlords are swimming in potential tenants.

There’s a big-box space shortage: Vacancy rates for existing retail space hit 4.9% at the end of last year, which is at the lowest since 2005, when commercial real estate firm CBRE started tracking it. This and the meager new construction since 2008 means there’s simply not enough space for companies like HomeGoods to chaotically display ceramic dog statues and gaudy throw pillows.

With large retail spaces in short supply, discount outlets like TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, Five Below, and even budget gym Planet Fitness are plotting to snatch up old BB&B locations, some even before the last toaster is sold.

Bottom line: The BB&B closures are a welcome influx of space. According to Coresight,  retailers opened more stores than they closed in 2022 for the first time since 2016.—MM

No Shave November in May…but for lawns <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Homeowners participating in No Mow May let their grass grow all month. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Francis Scialabba
To mow or not to mow? That is the question homeowners are debating as more cities and towns embrace No Mow May, a movement started in 2019 to revitalize backyard wildlife by refraining from lawn care for an entire month.

And it works, sort of.

In past years, participants have watched their lawns transform from an “ecological dead zone”—as one professor calls the average American yard—into a tall-grassed ecosystem rife with bumblebees, songbirds, chipmunks, and other forest friends...or foes. Last year, some Minnesotans called the police on snakes they spotted.

But some environmentalists say No Mow May <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Uw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> isn’t the right way to bring biodiversity back to residential areas because it “teases” insects and other pollinators. Their newfound habitat goes away when homeowners bust out the lawnmowers on June 1.

Instead, experts encourage supporting local wildlife by seeding native plants and other pollinator-attracting greenery. The Guelph Turfgrass Institute suggests channeling the benefits of No Mow May during the other 11 months by sectioning off a part of the yard as a permanent “wildflower zone.”—ML

Stat: What does it take to move a 331-pound stone from Scotland to London? A coronation. The Stone of Scone (also known as the Stone of Destiny) has left <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5SG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31321781.2899763> Edinburgh Castle to make its way to the big city for King Charles III’s little party next weekend. The stone is no stranger to such royal affairs: It was present at the anointing of Scottish kings for centuries before it got nabbed by England’s Edward I  in 1296. In 1996, Queen Elizabeth II agreed to send it back up north, but only if it RSVP’d yes to future coronations.

And yesterday, a judge who couldn’t help referencing the singer’s best tune in her ruling, refused to void the trademark and found that the less-famous Perry’s rights were violated by merch sold for the other Perry’s 2014 Australian concert tour.

Jerry Springer, ‘ringmaster of civilization’s end,’ dies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Jerry Springer sitting at a desk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OX?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Roy Rochlin/Getty Images
Jerry Springer, the talk show host, politician, and king of mess who pushed the boundaries of television with his eponymous daytime talk show, died yesterday at 79. He leaves behind a legacy of norm-defying, provocative storytelling about people on the fringes of society that laid the foundation for the current reality TV landscape.

The Jerry Springer Show, which ran from 1991 to 2018, peaked in popularity in 1998, drawing 12 million viewers and surpassing Oprah’s talk show in the ratings. That year, while Oprah was chatting with celebs like Madonna, Brad Pitt, and Tyra Banks, Springer interviewed three people in interspecies marriages.

Just how weird was The Jerry Springer Show? If you thought Dr. Phil’s “Cash Me Outside” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OY?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> episode was strange…you’d better sit down. Examples of guests Springer hosted include members of the KKK <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5OZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, adult babies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5O-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, a self-described kung fu hillbilly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5O_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, and a number of folks who came clean about extramarital affairs while on the show.

Springer said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P0?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> he only ever interviewed “regular folks, of no fame, little if any wealth, and very little influence,” and he faced many critics who said that in doing so, he profited off the exploitation of low-income people.

But Springer defended his approach. When asked in a 2014 BBC interview if he was ashamed of his show, he said, “You could decide only to put well-scrubbed, wealthy people who speak the Queen’s English on television and just do that, but that wouldn’t reflect the whole society.”

Springer was a busy guy

When he wasn’t breaking up fights on daytime TV, Springer also:

Started as a politician. He was an advisor to Robert F. Kennedy, served as the mayor of Cincinnati from 1977–1978, and ran for Ohio governor in 1982. Luckily, he lost and pivoted to TV.

Inspired a musical. Jerry Springer: The Opera has been running on and off since 2001.

Appeared in a number of other productions, including The Rocky Horror Show on Broadway, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P1?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, and most recently, The Masked Singer as a contestant.

Of course, for ’90s kids, Springer’s greatest role of all was keeping us company on sick days.—CC

Tour de headlines Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell Samuel Corum/Getty Images
Powell got punk’d. In January, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had a phone call with a person he thought was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky…but it was just a prank <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> by Russian tricksters, according to footage from Russian state television. In the video, Powell can be seen answering questions about inflation and the economy in ways that were consistent with his other statements—though the Fed said the video appears to have been edited and cannot confirm its accuracy. Powell isn’t the only victim of these pranksters; they also bamboozled their way to speak with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prince Harry.

Cigarette smoking hits a record low in the US. Just 1 in 9 Americans smoked cigarettes last year, a record low <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P6?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, according to the CDC. Compared to the 1960s, when 42% of US adults smoked cigarettes, it’s a dramatic drop that reflects greater awareness of the health risks of smoking, and economic hurdles like cigarette taxes. But Americans haven’t given up their nicotine addiction entirely. Vaping rose to almost 6% last year, and 14% of teens reported using e-cigarettes in another CDC study.

Stroud. Elsewhere in the NFL, the Baltimore Ravens and former MVP QB Lamar Jackson agreed to a five-year deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P8?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> worth $260 million, making Jackson the highest-paid player in the league.

A new challenger emerges in the weight-loss drug race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Eli Lilly manufactures Mounjaro and Trulicity, two antidiabetics with weight loss benefits. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5P9?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> Cristina Arias/Getty Images
Say buongiorno to Mounjaro.

The antidiabetic drug made by Eli Lilly that helps patients shed pounds could dethrone Wegovy (the weight-loss version of Ozempic) as the favorite among celebrities and wealthy people on a diet, according to new clinical trials.

The results reinforced previous findings that Mounjaro (generic name tirzepatide) can help diabetic and nondiabetic patients lose more weight than people did in past studies of Wegovy. But Mounjaro is currently only approved for diabetes, and prescribed patients could lose steady access to the drug.

Eli Lilly has already struggled through shortages of Mounjaro after a social-media-fueled demand for Ozempic seeped into the rest of the sector. And judging by how quickly Wegovy went to backorder after being officially approved for non-diabetes purposes, Mounjaro will likely also face a frenzy of weight-loss prescriptions that causes more shortages.

Once greenlighted for weight loss, Mounjaro is projected to become one of the highest-grossing drugs of all time with $50 billion in annual sales, driving the weight-loss/diabetes medication industry to what some estimate could be $150 billion per year. Wegovy and Ozempic raked in $10 billion last year for manufacturer Novo Nordisk.

The timeline: Eli Lilly expects the FDA to approve Mounjaro for weight loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pa?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> soon—perhaps by the end of the year. And the company is so confident in its potential “blockbuster” drug that it’s beginning an almost two-year trial this week to directly compare it against Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.—ML

The first film adaption of Judy Blume’s Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret premieres <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> in theaters today, and reminding many what it was like to be excited about wearing a bra. The novel, published in 1970, remains the beloved author’s best-selling book, but even today, it’s commonly banned around the country.

The story follows Margaret, an 11-year-old girl, as she navigates religion, periods, and toxic friendships in the New Jersey suburbs. Due to its frank discussion of menstruation and puberty, the book (and Blume’s other works) became a substitute of sorts for the sex ed many tweens never had in their classrooms.

That’s also why the novel received pushback

Are You There God and some of Blume’s other 32 titles were challenged during the first significant wave of banning books from schools in the ’80s. She’s spoken out against book bans, but her work is still being pulled from libraries for its discussion of teen sexuality and other taboo topics.

Most recently…Blume’s book Forever was included on a list of 80 books from celebrated authors like Toni Morrison and James Patterson banned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427> last month by a Florida school district.

If you’re thinking, “Well, I sure hope so,” this wasn’t always the case—as recently as 2015, the New York Times found that the number of Johns who ran large companies outnumbered the number of women who did. Still, women are significantly underrepresented in the corner office: They account for 8% of S&P 500 CEO positions, compared to their 50.5% share of the US population.

When asked by a reporter whether he considered the season a failure, Antetokounmpo responded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Pl?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31308756.3300427>, “There’s no failure in sports. There’s good days, bad days. Some days you’re able to be successful. Some days you’re not. Some days it’s your turn. Some days it’s not your turn.” To no one’s surprise, his meditation on success started popping up on LinkedIn.

Disney takes DeSantis feud to the next level <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Lz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Ron DeSantis in front of Disney logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Lz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Hannah Minn
The battle between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest employer is getting hotter than the final plate in the Hot Ones Challenge. Disney and DeSantis have been dueling like Peter Pan and Captain Hook ever since the company criticized the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill last spring, and yesterday Disney sued DeSantis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093>, claiming he orchestrated a campaign of retaliation against the company for exercising its free speech rights.

The feud hinges on control of the special district where Disney World sits. Disney filed its suit almost immediately after the board, hand-picked by DeSantis to govern the district, voted to nullify land use agreements made by the previous Disney-controlled board.

From a spoonful of sugar to a 74-page lawsuit

Disney’s suit accuses DeSantis of a “relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint.”

Disney called the board’s nullification of the earlier agreements “patently retaliatory, patently anti-business and patently unconstitutional.” The suit notes that its existing contracts with the state of Florida would invest $17 billion in Disney World and create 13,000 jobs over the next decade.

The lawsuit also claims that the continued attacks on Disney by DeSantis and other Florida lawmakers are a direct result of the company’s expressed opinion on state legislation.

Historically, Florida has been known for being business-friendly—and Disney, which powers the state’s tourism economy, has benefited from that. Since 1967, the theme park has existed harmoniously with the greater Orlando area as a special tax district, allowing it to essentially act as its own county. But that’s precisely what DeSantis claims is the root of his conflict with the company, saying it has “gotten away with special deals from the State of Florida for way too long.”

Looking ahead…we don’t know if this will impact Florida’s pro-business reputation, but as DeSantis prepares for a potential 2024 presidential bid, even some of his fellow Republicans have criticized his actions against Disney.—CC

McCarthy scores a victory with debt bill that won’t become law. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy corralled just enough votes from his GOP colleagues yesterday to pass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LE?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> a bill to raise the debt ceiling while making stark spending cuts. The 320-page bill is meant to be an opening salvo in negotiations with President Biden, who is hoping to avoid an economically catastrophic default. It’s got about as much chance of being the final word on the matter as we do of winning the Nobel Prize—it won’t make it out of the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the president has threatened to veto it.

The move came as a shock because the regulator had previously said Microsoft had assuaged its concerns about the console gaming market. The decision, which Microsoft plans to appeal, puts a strain on the deal while the companies wait for competition decisions from the EU and the US, where the FTC has already sued to try to scuttle it.

Ed Sheeran went to trial yesterday, not for his crimes of pseudo-rapping in “Galway Girl,” but for accusations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LI?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> that he plagiarized Marvin Gaye’s song “Let’s Get It On.” The copyright lawsuit outcome (expected next week) could have major implications on who owns the rights to seemingly common musical elements.

The case dates back to 2017, when the family of Ed Townsend—Gaye’s co-writer on “Let’s Get It On”—sued Sheeran for $100 million, alleging that he copy-and-pasted a four chord progression from the song for his Grammy-winning bop “Thinking Out Loud.”

On one hand…the chord progression does sound almost identical.

And the plaintiff’s lawyer said a video of Sheeran singing a mashup of the two songs at a concert is the star’s “confession.”

Sheeran’s rebuttal was that if he stole Gaye and Townsend’s song, he’d be “quite an idiot to stand on a stage in front of 20,000 people” and perform it.

Sheeran also said during his testimony, “Most pop songs can fit over most pop songs.” His defense team claims that there’s over a dozen songs that use the same chord progression.

Big picture: Copyright infringement claims have been popping up more frequently in the music industry in recent years. This is the third time Sheeran has had to argue that his slow jams weren’t rip-offs.—MM

Janet Jackson gets hip-checked by the Hawks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LM?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Janet Jackson's concert got postponed one night to accommodate Game 6 for the Hawks. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LM?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> Morning Brew / Photo: Getty Images
No one was counting on the Atlanta Hawks getting booted from the playoffs more than the folks who run the team’s stadium—and maybe Janet Jackson.

The singer/actress/dancer was supposed to perform tonight at State Farm Arena, but her concert has been moved to tomorrow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5LN?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31294555.2885093> after the Hawks secured a last-minute upset over the Celtics this week, bringing the series home for Game 6.

It’s the type of scheduling chaos that conversion crews—the people who assemble courts and stages between events—are actually accustomed to during playoff season, when stadiums get more double-booked than the Airbnb from Barbarian.

Billy Joel had to reschedule a show this week, too. Four consecutive nights of Knicks and Rangers games at Madison Square Garden pushed the Piano Man’s concert from its primo Saturday spot to Tuesday.

LA’s Crypto.com Arena managed a 90-minute turnaround between Clippers and Lakers games last Saturday—sandwiched in the middle of the Kings NHL playoff games on Friday and Sunday. Fun fact: The rink stays covered and insulated between games, meaning basketball players are dribbling around over ice each time they play.

One night, two queens of pop: Janet Jackson’s rescheduled concert will take place at the same time as the first of Taylor Swift’s three Eras Tour shows in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.—ML

Opining that movies reflect the times in which they were made, the director said, “I should have never messed with the archives of my own work.” Still no apology for making Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, though.

While egg prices have fallen dramatically and even Chipotle has paused price hikes on burrito bowls, one sector of the economy remains stubbornly expensive: rents.

In the latest consumer price index report, the shelter category (aka rents) was the largest contributor by far to overall inflation.

And despite moderating in recent months, rent growth remains 17% higher than 2021 levels.

So, why aren’t rent prices falling like most other things in the economy? And what factors pushed rents so high in the first place?

Generative AI joins the 2024 presidential race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Io?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> Snowy mountains fill the landscape behind the Hollywood sign. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Io?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> Patrick T.

After President Biden announced his reelection bid yesterday morning, the Republican National Committee swiftly responded with an attack ad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ip?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>. The video asked the question “What if the weakest president we’ve ever had were re-elected?” and then…imagined the answer.

It had some help from artificial intelligence. The 30-second video used generative AI tools to create images and video of The Last of Us-looking scenes, including one where the army is occupying San Francisco because the city had supposedly been overtaken by crime and fentanyl. The RNC told Axios that it’s the first video the organization has ever created completely using AI.

Get used to it

The video is likely just the start of a 2024 presidential race influenced by AI. While political campaigns have used AI tools to help canvass voters for years, recent breakthroughs in generative AI (like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other programs) have taken the tech to a whole new level of realism.

And, if the past few months are any indication, powerful figures are among the most popular targets of AI-generated shenanigans.

Fake photos (fauxtos, if you will) of the pope swagged out in a giant white puffer coat and former President Trump being carried away by cops went viral due to their shocking realism.

It’s not just images: Fake audio <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iq?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> of Biden and Trump slinging insults at each other while they play a video game made the rounds on TikTok and Instagram. Those two men could very well square off in the general election.

Not only has generative AI technology dramatically improved since the last election, but so has access to these programs. ChatGPT, for instance, became the fastest-growing consumer app in history after racking up 100 million users in just two months.

Experts say that since anyone with a computer and a wild imagination can use AI programs, misinformation could be churned out at rapid speed during this election—especially since social media companies have loose policies to keep AI-generated political content in check.

Counterpoint: Misinformation is already doing just fine without AI. Chris Meserole, a Brookings Institution fellow, told Fortune that “recent presidential elections have already witnessed such high levels of human-written misinformation” and expects the next election to look pretty similar to those of 2020 and 2016.

Plus, concerned citizens raised alarms during the 2020 presidential election that deepfakes would sow chaos and confuse voters. But that…didn’t end up happening <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ir?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>.—MM

Alphabet and Microsoft kept calm and carried on. The two tech giants posted earnings that showed they’re both on solid footing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iv?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>, despite investors’ concerns that growth would slow to a trickle. For Alphabet, Google Search advertising revenue grew again after a quarter in the red. And Microsoft’s all-important cloud division posted better-than-expected sales. Both companies discussed how AI could impact for their businesses, but they differed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Iw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> in their predictions: Microsoft characterized AI as a much more disruptive force than Google did.

RIP Harry Belafonte.

You probably know Belafonte best for his catchy-as-all-heck take on the Jamaican folk song, “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)” released in 1956. But after achieving unprecedented commercial success for any musician at the time, especially a Black artist, Belafonte turned his attention to political activism and the fight for civil rights. Belafonte even put up bail for MLK and other civil rights activists to get them out of jail.

Charge more, see what happens. That’s exactly what many consumer-facing corporations including Chipotle and McDonald’s did in response to historic inflation…and it’s worked out pretty great for them <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>, according to their earnings reports this week.

PepsiCo products were 16% pricier last quarter, but it sold only 2% less of them, resulting in a 10.2% sales bump.

Consumer giants Kimberly-Clark, Nestlé, and P&G raked in more revenue last quarter after they all jacked up prices by about 10%.

Higher sticker prices helped GM add almost $1,800 to its per-car profit in North America and grow its revenue.

But the good times won’t last. After more than a year of getting hammered by inflation, consumers are starting to resist paying farmers market prices at the grocery store. Pepsi’s CFO said its customers have already been opting for cheaper products <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IA?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385>, and the CEO of McDonald’s told the Financial Times that customers were starting to push back on the company’s beefier price tags.

Looking ahead…execs at companies like Coca-Cola say it’s only a matter of time before they’ll have to stop increasing prices, or else risk losing customers. Chipotle already beat Coke to it, saying it had paused price hikes.—SK

Apparently, counting melatonin isn’t as easy as counting sheep. A study released yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IG?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> showed that the labels on sleepy-time gummies frequently misrepresent the amount of melatonin they contain.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that 22 out of the 25 melatonin products tested by researchers had inaccurate labels that most often lowballed the amount of melatonin they contained. One product even had 347% of the stated amount of melatonin.

For an adult, extra melatonin usually just makes you feel like you had too many Vodka Red Bulls the night before. But for kids, higher levels of melatonin can cause health problems.

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of pediatric melatonin ingestions reported to poison control surged 530%, according to a CDC report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5IH?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31283300.2878385> last year. Of the 260,000+ incidents reported over that time, over 4,000 kids were hospitalized, five required mechanical ventilation, and two died.

Pediatricians warn that since melatonin is a hormone, even normal consumption on a regular basis can affect a child’s development in puberty.

Big picture: Industry reps and the FDA agree that the dietary supplement marketplace needs a regulatory overhaul. Current US regulations do not require supplement-makers to conduct any clinical trials or obtain FDA approval before putting their products on the shelf. Meanwhile, in the EU, the UK, Canada, and others, melatonin requires a prescription.—CC

A tale of 2 prime-time stars flaming out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5EC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5EC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Photo Illustration: Hannah Minn/ Photo: Getty Images
Yesterday was a big day for shake-ups in the cable news world: Fox News broke up with Tucker Carlson, and shortly after, CNN announced that they ousted Don Lemon. Both stars were major personalities for their networks.

What’s behind all the moves? For Carlson, it’s likely more about what’s been happening in the courtroom than on your TV.

Dominion’s defamation lawsuit against Fox, which the network settled less than a week ago for $787.5 million, made Carlson’s private text messages public—including some that criticized Fox’s senior leadership. Those messages played a role in his departure from Fox, per the Washington Post.

Plus, former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg filed a lawsuit last month accusing Carlson and his executive producer, Justin Wells, among others, of sexism and harassment. Wells was let go along with Carlson, and, according to the LA Times, Grossberg’s lawsuit was the main factor in the decision, handed down by Rupert Murdoch, to fire Carlson.

Meanwhile, Lemon made headlines in February for saying that “a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s,” and more recently had combative interviews with some guests. According to the New York Times, Lemon’s future at CNN “had become untenable.”

The bottom line for networks

It appears that Carlson was worth over $500 million—that’s how much the Fox Corp.’s market value dropped after his ousting made news. It’s not entirely surprising: Tucker Carlson Tonight was as synonymous with Fox as Law & Order is to NBC. It has been one of the top shows on cable news and regularly drew more than 3 million nightly viewers.

For CNN, firing Lemon, who had been at the network for 17 years, is one of many recent moves in programming as the network tries to catch up with its competitors. As cable news viewership continues to decrease, all the major networks are launching new shows and overhauling programming to try to recapture the ratings glory days of 2015.—CC

According to Monogram, the problem is straightforward. Today, surgeons perform around 1.7m knee replacement surgeries annually, but as many as 100k of these fail. That’s exactly why Dr. Doug Unis founded Monogram.

With the help of advanced surgical robotics and personalized, 3D-printed implants, Monogram is trying to make knee replacement surgeries safer, less invasive, and more precise.

Tour de headlines Aaron Rodgers
Aaron Rodgers traded to the NY Jets, ESPN reports. After 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, the four-time MVP quarterback is headed to NYC <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Eg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> in a long-anticipated trade. Uncertain of his next move this winter, Rodgers famously entered a darkness retreat in Oregon, and apparently left the experience with the desire to pay a lot more for housing. Rodgers’s move from Green Bay to New York near the end of his career is reminiscient of Brett Favre’s trade to the Jets 15 years ago, which allowed a young Rodgers to take the reins at Lambeau Field.

First Republic Bank lost $102 billion in deposits last month. That’s not good. The regional lender that got swept up in March’s bank turmoil said that deposits plunged nearly 41% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Eh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> last quarter, and they would have fallen by more than 50% if 11 large banks hadn’t plugged it with $30 billion to shore up confidence. But what little confidence was restored seems to have evaporated, not least because execs ended their earnings call after just 12 minutes. The bank’s stock, already down 87% this year, dropped by another ~18% after it released its results.

Apple triumphs in Epic app store dispute, again. An appeals court upheld <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ei?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Apple’s victory in Fortnite-maker Epic Games’s antitrust lawsuit over Apple’s App Store fees. The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed a 2021 trial ruling in the blockbuster legal case that Apple wasn’t running the store like a monopoly. Though the appeals court upheld part of the ruling that favored Epic, Apple called the court’s decision “a resounding victory,” noting that it won on nine out of 10 of the suit’s claims.

Europe finally has a company worth $500 billion since LVMH hit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ek?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> the milestone market valuation yesterday. The French conglomerate best known for flashy fashion and upmarket alcohol that scream “affluence” recently became the 10th largest company in the world.

As Bloomberg notes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ek?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>, selling status is to France what Big Tech is to the US—three of France’s Top 4 most valuable companies are luxury brands. And LVMH is France’s Apple: Both industry behemoths sell wallet-busting products, thrive even amid economic downturns, and produce some of the most recognizable products of their home countries.

And if you need more proof that LVMH dominates, its owner Bernard Arnault is the world’s richest man, with a net worth of nearly $212 billion. He’s also set up a real-life succession battle among his children, who all hold key roles in the company.

But France’s high-end labels saw their stock prices soar in the first quarter of 2023 thanks to…

China’s reopening, which buoyed demand for products that help folks splurge and wear their wealth on their sleeves.

A strong euro and stable margins that ensure healthy profits.

Looking ahead…Though times have been good for the high-end, the luxury boom could slow if a recession hits and gets people thinking twice before dropping a car’s-worth of cash on a handbag.—SK

Everybody hates the Snapchat AI bot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ex?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Snapchat users really don't like the new "My AI" feature. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ex?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699> Francis Scialabba
Snapchat’s latest update has elicited the types of reviews typically reserved for a restaurant that just gave food poisoning to its entire dining room.

“My AI” is a ChatGPT-enabled bot that went live to Snapchat’s 750 million active users on Wednesday. The response: a wave of one-star app store reviews that sank Snapchat’s weekly average rating to 1.67.

The bot was immediately unpopular—Snap’s stock price took a hit as soon as it was announced last week (though it has since regained some ground). And now that people have had time to ask it some questions, the feature is, as one reviewer put it, “freaking kids and adults out.”

My AI seems to have more access to personal info than it’s letting on. Users report that, when asked, the bot says it doesn’t know their location…but it’s able to accurately suggest a nearby restaurant.

The bot also stays pinned to the top of the chat screen—you can’t get it out of sight unless you’re willing to pay $4 a month for Snapchat+. Even then—like the feeling of sending a photo meant for your significant other to your family—it can’t be deleted, just hidden.

Zoom out: Snapchat has a history of enraging its users with unpopular updates (remember the 2020 redesign <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Ey?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>?), but these changes have actually resulted in a flurry of new users, data from Sensor Tower shows.—ML

Stat: Global military spending hit an unprecedented high of $2.2 trillion last year, thanks in part to the war in Ukraine and the ambitions of China, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But nobody spends on the military like the US spends <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5E5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31269320.2886699>. The US’ $877 billion expenditure was three times bigger than the country with the next most lavish budget, China—and amounted to more cash than the next 10 biggest spenders paid out combined.

The artist tweeted Sunday that she’d accept her standard agreement  for collaboration with other artists for AI-made jams and continued, “Feel free to use my voice without penalty.

Good morning. What do very happy people in common? The Wall Street Journal called up the 12% of respondents in a WSJ-NORC survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zd?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> who called themselves “very happy”  and asked them what they were all about. Here are the traits they share.

Companionship: 67% of the happiest people said that marriage was very important to them, compared to 43% of overall respondents.

Religion: Two-thirds of very happy people characterized themselves as moderately or very religious. The overall share: less than half.

Closer to death: People 60 and over accounted for 44% of the happiest group, but represented 30% of total survey respondents.

Gym rats: Fitness was a common interest among very happy people.

What doesn’t seem to matter to being very happy? Political party affiliation or avoiding following politics.

Bed Bath & Bankrupt <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5ze?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> Store closing sale announcement at a Bed Bath & Beyond indoor mall in northern Idaho <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5ze?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> Don & Melinda Crawford/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
You have two days left to remember where you hoarded your 20%-off Bed Bath & Beyond coupons and redeem them. After limping along in poor financial health for years, the retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zf?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> on Sunday and said it would stop accepting its famous coupons on Wednesday.

Bed Bath & Beyond coupons are getting scrapped, and so are the stores that accept them. As part of its bankruptcy and liquidation, the company said it plans to close all of its 360 BB&B locations and its 120 Buybuy Baby stores by June 30—if a last-minute buyer doesn’t rescue it from going out of business.

A bad bet on private labels

You can’t blame this business failure on “economic uncertainty.” Numerous bad decisions by Bed Bath & Beyond management led to the chain’s demise, but the worst own-goal of all was its pivot to private-label products, or items that were made exclusively for Bed Bath & Beyond.

This effort was led by Mark Tritton, a former Target exec who was installed by activist investors in 2019. Tritton worked private-label magic at Target, releasing dozens of highly profitable Target-only lines that offered a promising roadmap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zg?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> for other retailers to follow.

But when Tritton tried to replicate his Target success at Bed Bath & Beyond, that strategy broke down like a cheap blender. In certain categories like kitchen appliances, brands matter, and shoppers stopped showing up to Bed Bath & Beyond after it swapped out KitchenAid mixers and OXO garlic mincers for its own stuff.

What happens next? A massive going-out-of-business sale <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zh?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> matched only by Toys R Us and Circuit City in the last 15 years, Axios notes.

Plus, if you’re one of the many individual investors who piled into Bed Bath & Beyond when it was a trendy meme stock last year, you’ll need to take your medicine and move on. In bankruptcy proceedings, debtholders get prioritized over shareholders, so meme-stock traders will be left holding the bag.

Investors earn 325% annualized return here (really) <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5us?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550&lp=title> Masterworks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5us?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550&lp=image>
While the ultra-rich have been banking off this under-the-radar asset for centuries, a group of everyday investors just used it to rake in a whopping 325% annualized gain.

Sounds totally ridiculous? It definitely does. But it’s also 100% true.

The asset was a sculpture offered by the fractional art investment platform Masterworks. After just 36 days, investors profited a 15.4% net gain—a triple-digit return on an annualized basis.

While it’s not common for Masterworks to get a profitable exit that fast, every one of their 13 exits has returned a profit to investors, totaling more than $35 million in payouts.

Foreign governments evacuate diplomats from Sudan.

The situation is getting dire <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zm?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> for Sudanese people caught in the crossfire: More than 420 people have been killed; food, water, and electricity are getting scarce; and internet and phone service suffered a “near-total collapse” yesterday, according to NetBlocks, a monitoring service.

NBC boss gets the boot. Jeff Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, is leaving the company <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zn?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> for “inappropriate conduct,” parent company Comcast said. In a joint statement, Shell acknowledged “an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, which I deeply regret.” Shell was one of the most powerful figures in media, overseeing everything from Universal theme parks to NBC News and Bravo. He joins a list of other media execs, including CNN’s Jeff Zucker, who have stepped down over inappropriate relationships at work.

Dead celebrities get blue checkmarks on Twitter. Prominent people who are deceased, such as Chadwick Boseman, Barbara Walters, and Anthony Bourdain, have received a verification badge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zo?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> on Twitter that’s now reserved for accounts that pay $8/month for a subscription to Twitter Blue. A note from the company on their pages states that these celebs have paid for the subscription, even though they are…not alive. Twitter has also restored blue check marks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zp?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> to many other living celebrities who aren’t paying for Twitter Blue, either. So, what this all amounts to, seemingly, is that CEO Elon Musk is partially recreating the verification system he made a big deal of destroying.

Bud Light’s VP of marketing, Alissa Heinerscheid, and her boss, Daniel Blake, were placed on leave <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zr?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> following conservative backlash to a recent campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

Since she became the first woman ever to lead Bud Light’s marketing last June, Heinerscheid set out to revive the declining brand by appealing to women and younger people. Those efforts included a partnership <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zs?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer who promoted Bud Light’s March Madness giveaway on April 1 with a personalized can she’d been sent by the company.

This partnership did not sit well with many conservatives, who attacked Bud Light for being another corporation that went “woke” by prioritizing inclusivity. Kid Rock filmed himself shooting 12-packs of Bud Light, and other conservatives used social media to urge a boycott of the brand.

What’s Bud Light’s response been? Last week, the CEO of parent Anheuser-Busch released a non-statement statement, writing, “We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.” And yesterday’s shake-up shows it’s not happy with how the Mulvaney campaign went down. Along with sidelining the two execs, it’s changing its marketing department’s structure so that senior employees have more visibility ​​into all decisions.

The boycott appears to be having some effect on business. According to Beer Business Daily, Bud Light sales fell 10.7% the weekend ended April 8, while rival Molson Coors appears to have gotten at least a short-term lift.

CALENDAR

The week ahead The week ahead Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
Biden may announce reelection bid tomorrow. The US president will reportedly debut his reelection campaign <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zw?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> in a video message as soon as Tuesday. If elected to another four-year term, Biden would be 86 at the end of his White House tenure, older than any other president in history by far.

Stuffed earnings week: It might be easier to list who isn’t reporting earnings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zx?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> this week. Tech giants including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta will drop Q1 financials, but so will many other large firms such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Spotify, GM, Boeing, and ExxonMobil.

Debt ceiling vote: With time ticking for the government to raise the debt ceiling and avoid economic catastrophe, the House is expected to vote <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zy?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550> on a Republican bill that would raise the debt ceiling this week. It’s stuffed with things Democrats don’t approve of (like tighter rules on food stamps), so it’s intended to be starting point for negotiations.

Everything else…

Israel will mark its 75th birthday this week amid ongoing protests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s (paused) plan to overhaul the judiciary.

A movie adaptation of Judy Blume’s Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret will be released on Friday.

Quote: “I’m not sure I can actually process what happened tonight.”

Usually not at a loss for words, an emotional Ryan Reynolds said he was “a little speechless <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5zz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31257551.3215550>” after Welsh soccer club Wrexham won its game on Saturday to secure promotion to the fourth tier of English soccer for the first time in 15 years. Reynolds and his friend Rob McElhenney bought the struggling team in 2021, and after producing tremendous on-the-field progress and off-the-field publicity just two years later, these two Hollywood stars will never have to buy a pint in town again.

Vin Diesel averages 1.95 sleeveless shirts per film and wears one in 16 of his 23 films, the analysis claims. Reddit is undefeated.

Good morning and Happy Earth Day. A lot had to go right for us to be living here.

First: location, location, location. Earth is located in a remote corner of the Milky Way. And while that means we have to Uber everywhere, it also means fewer threats like a huge star devouring us with its gravity. The star we do have nearby, the sun, is pretty stable and the perfect distance away to sustain liquid water (important!). And when the sun sends deadly flares our way, we’re safe because the Earth’s core produces a magnetic field that deflects radiation.

The Earth also contains critical elements like oxygen and carbon, its atmosphere traps heat (but not too much), its neighbor/protector Jupiter deflects asteroids and comets from smashing into it, its moon stabilizes the climate, and its active plate tectonic system produces volcanoes, whose eruptions may have led to the first instances of life.

Plus, it’s the only planet in the galaxy where you can get a good gyro.

SCOTUS upholds access to abortion pills…for now <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> Image of mifepristone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z3?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
In its first major ruling on abortion since overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court handed down a 7–2 decision <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z4?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> yesterday allowing mifepristone to remain widely available while the legal battle over the FDA’s two-decade-old approval of the abortion medication rages.

And it’s going to rage: The matter reached the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Texas yanked the FDA’s approval of the drug. That ruling would have blocked nationwide access to the medication, spooking pharmaceutical companies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5z5?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> by raising the possibility that any drug approval could be nixed later. The government quickly appealed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected parts of the judge’s decision but still imposed restrictions on the medicine’s availability.

Meanwhile, the same day the Texas ruling came out, a Washington federal judge ordered the FDA not to restrict access to the pill in 17 states.

Plus, a generic drugmaker subsequently sued to keep its version of the pill on the market regardless of the Texas ruling.

The Supreme Court’s decision means the status quo will be maintained while that all gets sorted out.

But with the case all but guaranteed to end up back at the high court for a final say eventually, what it doesn’t do is tell us much about what the justices will ultimately decide when it gets there.

Why not? Because the brief, unsigned order came in response to an emergency petition, making it part of the court’s so-called shadow docket, where decisions get made quickly and without the benefit of oral arguments. Also, it’s pretty standard to block changes from taking place while appeals wind their way through the courts.

But there were a few hints: Both Justice Alito and Justice Thomas dissented from the order, saying they would have permitted the restrictions on the drug to take effect.

What comes next? The case is scheduled to pick back up with oral arguments at the 5th Circuit on May 17.—AR

Chaos on the bird app. Impostor accounts sprang up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yz?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> on Twitter yesterday following the removal of legacy blue checks for brands and public, media, and government figures not willing to pay for a subscription. In one example, a fake account with a paid-for blue check posing as a Sudanese paramilitary sent a tweet that got millions of views, which falsely said that its leader had been killed in the conflict there. Elsewhere on Twitter: All labels calling accounts “government-funded media” were removed (not just the recent controversial ones).

NFL’s biggest gambling crackdown.

Players are not allowed to bet on any NFL-related games or events, but can bet on non-NFL games as long as they aren’t on NFL turf. Three of the players, Quintez Cephus and C.J. Moore of the Lions and Shaka Toney of the Washington Commanders, were suspended indefinitely (through 2023 at least). Jameson Williams and Stanley Berryhill got shorter, six-game suspensions.

Parents will have to go back to criticizing their kids for excessive screen time or killing golf, because not owning a home is no longer an accurate roast. A new report from Redfin found that 30% of Gen Zers age 19–25 owned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yC?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> their own homes as of last year—which is higher than the 27% of Gen Xers and 28% of millennials that did at the same age.

Before all you 30-something renters freak out, most young homebuyers bought in cheap areas and jumped on low interest rates.

Gen Z’s favorite place to buy a house? Virginia Beach, VA, where they accounted for 9% of all home purchases last year. The median house sale price for a Gen Z buyer in the area was $255,000 in 2022…$199,525 less than the  average median sale price in the US last year, according to the St. Louis Fed.

It also comes down to timing. Gen Zers entered a tight labor market with high wages, while millennials had to wade through the fallout of the 2008 recession before they were able to establish themselves financially.

Looking ahead…with interest rate hikes pushing mortgage rates past 6% this year and supply tightening, Gen Zers may not keep up their homebuying pace.—MM

Fallon / Getty Images
California’s historic snowfall this year helped pull the state out of a drought and blessed our feeds with photos of snowy palm trees...but now it’s starting to melt, setting up a summer of flooding.

Officials warn that warmer temperatures will cause the massive snowpack <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yZ?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> atop the Sierra Nevadas to overflow reservoirs, spilling into lakes and valleys that are already buckling under last month’s storms. To give you an idea of just how much melted snow there’ll be, it’s enough to submerge 30 million football fields under a foot of water.

Where’s all that water going?

The biggest threat is to downstream communities to the west of the Sierra Nevadas, and in some valleys to the east.

California’s San Joaquin Valley stands to suffer most from impending floods, which could last through the year.

The mountainside counties of Fresno, Kings, and Tulare–which has a recently revived lake <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5y-?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> that’s already damaged hundreds of buildings–are under a flood warning until further notice.

It won’t happen all at once: Temps these next few days are forecast to hit the 80s, causing some melt, but the true danger will be 90-degree June days.

Big picture: With an estimated 98% of the snowpack still up there, Central Californians are bracing for a very wet year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5y_?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> that could cost billions in infrastructure and agricultural damages.—ML

It’s only champagne if it comes from the Champagne region of France; otherwise it’s just sparkling wine—or in this case lager. Belgian customs officials recently destroyed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5yH?mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&cid=31247888.2901751> 2,352 cans of Miller High Life destined for Germany because they bore the brand’s longtime slogan “Champagne of Beers” at the request of the powerful Comité Champagne. The brand, which doesn’t export to Europe, didn’t object, but said, “We invite our friends in Europe to the US any time to toast the High Life together.”

Good morning. It’s Good Friday, which is a market holiday but not a federal holiday. That will result in a highly unusual scenario: When the government releases the pivotal jobs report this morning, the stock market won’t be open to react to it. Investors will have to spend three days marinating in the details before placing their wagers on Monday. Maybe there’s a moral to this story about resisting knee-jerk reactions, but we’ll leave that for LinkedIn...

When your billionaire friend invites you on their yacht for an island-hopping adventure, you reply, “omw.”

Well, unless you’re a Supreme Court justice—then you might want to think twice.

Clarence Thomas apparently didn’t get the memo because, according to a bombshell ProPublica report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9b343d70> published yesterday, the conservative Supreme Court justice has been whisked around on luxury vacations for 20+ years by the Dallas-based real estate mogul and GOP megadonor Harlan Crow. These gifted vacations, which Thomas didn’t disclose, have alarmed ethics watchdogs and spurred calls by senators to create a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.

Currently, the SCOTUS justices are the only federal judges <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7353fdf1> who aren’t officially tied to a code of conduct, according to Bloomberg. However, they are required to report when they travel on a private jet (which Thomas did with Crow) and stay at commercial properties like resorts. Since Thomas didn’t disclose these gifts, ethics experts told ProPublica that he appears to have violated the law.

Got my toes in the water…

What were these luxury vacations Thomas took on Crow’s dime? Some include…

Nine days on a megayacht in Indonesia, a trip that would have cost Thomas and his wife $500,000+ had they paid for it themselves, ProPublica wrote.

Summer stays at Crow’s estate in the Adirondacks, Camp Topridge, where Thomas reportedly came into contact with execs at Verizon and PwC, as well as big GOP donors.

In a statement to ProPublica, Crow said that Thomas never asked to be taken on vacations, and his invites were “no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends.”

But a SCOTUS justice is not like Crow’s other friends, in that they are expected to avoid any appearance of outside influence in order to maintain public trust in the institution. The revelation that Thomas accepted secret gifts from the ultrawealthy shows that he “seems to have completely disregarded his higher ethical obligations,” former government ethics lawyer Virginia Canter told ProPublica.—NF

When McDonald’s cut hundreds of corporate jobs this week, it utilized a pandemic trend that’s still going strong: remote layoffs. The fast-food giant closed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UUw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0ee558cb> corporate offices Monday–Wednesday to remotely lay off a slice of its 45,000 US (and some international) white-collar workers.

Telling an employee their position has been eliminated in front of a blurred Zoom background has gotten a lot more common since waves of corporate workers ditched their offices at the onset of the pandemic. But in turning to remote layoffs, some companies have made an awful situation even awful-er:

When Twitter closed its offices to cut nearly 3,700 staffers in November, some employees reported losing access to work emails and Slack in the middle of the night prior to receiving an emailed pink slip.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, chaotically laid off <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UU0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb791de66> 6% of its staff in January via email.

Better.com’s CEO infamously laid off 900 employees in a virtual town hall in December 2021.

HR experts have mixed feelings. Some argue that finding out the bad news in the comfort of your home is a better alternative to packing up your office plants while catching coworker side-eyes. Plus, why drag someone into the office only to send them back home? But others say email and Zoom are impersonal and relieve managers of taking responsibility for layoffs.

The video game industry made about $320 billion last year—levels above what TV and movies earn—and the industry will be worth $482 billion in 2027, Statista estimates.

Board games aren’t quite as lucrative ($11 billion to $13 billion in annual sales) but are growing at a similar clip. The tabletop RPG Dungeons & Dragons had over 50 million players as of 2020, and its audience was growing 33% annually.

But can Hollywood reproduce that success? The Super Mario Bros. Movie, despite reviews dissing it as “8-bit <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UVQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3b47e6c4>,” is expected to gross <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UVU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C954fcee4> upward of $75 million this Friday to Sunday. That would be the best opening weekend for a video game adaptation ever, spinning past Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

Bottom line: When it comes to video game adaptations, you haven’t seen the last of us.—JW

Key performance indicators Diddy on a $5,000 bill Morning Brew
Stat: Sean “Diddy” Combs revealed that he pays Sting $5,000 per day <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31092873.2913513/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80UFQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA5Mjg3My4yOTEzNTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C134f74ca> for sampling the singer’s “Every Breath You Take” on his own 1997 track, “I’ll Be Missing You”—a tribute to Biggie Smalls. Sting has said that Diddy never asked him for permission to sample his song until “after the fact,” but it seems to have worked out because now he’s raking in $1.8 million a year in passive income. Of course, Sting doesn’t really need Diddy’s royalties—he sold his music catalog to Universal Records for ~$300 million last year.

Unlike other high-profile execs, Cook’s corporate email address is public (tcook@apple.com), though an army of assistants will probably review your note before it gets to him. Jeff Bezos, on the other hand, has said he spends his mornings “puttering” before his first meeting at 10am.

There are two times in your life when you will be pushed to the max of your cardio ability: 1) the elementary school PACER Test and 2) running from one end of the Atlanta airport to the other to make a 15-minute connection.

NPR, which usually plays the role of soft-spoken sidekick, was the main character of yesterday’s Twitter drama. The social media platform put a “US state-affiliated media <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TWs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Caf2f04c8>” tag on NPR’s account, a loaded label that suggests it’s an accessory to the US government.

Some background: Twitter started using the label in the pre-Elon Musk days of 2020 for transparency, defining state-affiliated media as “outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content.” Up until Tuesday night, its policy explicitly said that state-funded media operating with editorial independence, like the BBC and…NPR did not fall into the category. But, like a newly dumped ex cleansing their grid, Twitter seems to have deleted all mentions of NPR from the policy.

Why now? Twitter, which has no PR department, hasn’t said why it started lumping NPR in with news sites notorious for spreading government propaganda, like China Daily and Russia Today. But Musk tweeted, “Seems accurate” in response to a tweet about the new label.

Whatever Twitter’s reasons, NPR’s chief communications officer told <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TWw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7877b21f> the NYT that less than 1% of the org’s yearly operating budget comes from government-funded grants. Most of the organization’s funding comes from individual and business donations. Other media orgs that receive substantial government funding, like Voice of America and the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes, don’t have the label, the Washington Post noted.

The label’s addition not only suggests to the NPR account’s 8.8 million Twitter followers (and anyone who views it) that its reporting is less than credible, but it also means NPR will not be amplified via Twitter’s recommendation algorithm.

This is part of a pattern for Musk’s Twitter: The site recently took away the main New York Times account’s verification badge while leaving them on for other news outlets after the Times said it wouldn’t pay for the blue check. And several reporters who criticized Musk had their accounts suspended last year.—MM

Earlier this week, China warned that if McCarthy took the meeting, it could provoke a “severe confrontation.”

When it comes to burrito bowls named after a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper, fast-casual chain Chipotle believes Highlander-style there can only be one. Just in time for today’s National Burrito Day promotion, the Mexican grill slapped its rival for lunchtime supremacy, Sweetgreen, with a trademark lawsuit <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TXI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5a4d8ad6> over the salad spot’s new “Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl.”

The suit, filed in California federal court Tuesday, claims Sweetgreen is trying to take advantage of customer goodwill toward the Chipotle brand. It further maintains that Sweetgreen has advertised the new bowl using the word “Chipotle” in the font and style used for Chipotle’s logo and deployed an ad background color similar to the brand’s trademarked Adobo Red hue.

In a press release introducing the new menu item last week, Sweetgreen said it was named for the “thoughtfully-sourced chipotle powder that provides the perfect slightly spicy, smokey bite.” But Chipotle’s legal complaint asserts that industry publications—and even Sweetgreen’s own social media comments—have noted the similarity to Chipotle’s offerings.

Big picture: News of the lawsuit sent Sweetgreen’s stock plunging yesterday. It ended the day down 6.26%—another setback for the salad-maker, whose shares are down ~20% in 2023 so far as it struggles to turn a profit. Chipotle, meanwhile, has seen its stock surge 24% this year thanks to strong sales.—AR

Artificial intelligence is being used to create Balenciaga-fied versions of movies and TV shows—a lucky hit of positive publicity for the high-fashion brand that was wrapped up in scandals last year.

A timeline for those of you out touching grass:

YouTube channel demonflyingfox posted “Harry Potter by Balenciaga <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80bkQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2B830bae07>” three weeks ago (it now has over four million views), and it—along with a similar channel called Abandoned Films <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TXc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2B04067436> that started posting content at the same time —has since continued posting Balenciaga crossovers, including for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.

And about two weeks ago, an AI-generated photo of Pope Francis <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Qlk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cafae9623> in a Balenciaga coat went mega-viral on Twitter after first being posted on Reddit and Facebook.

How do they do it? By using AI image generators such as Midjourney and AI voice generators like Eleven Labs—which Abandoned Films tagged in the LOTR video where a snatched Boromir says, “One does not simply walk into a Balenciaga fashion show.”

Stat: Despite advice to the contrary from every personal finance guru on the internet, most people don’t ask for more money when they’re offered a job: 58% of men and 61% of women said they didn’t when they were last hired, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TVU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce552f5a2>. But even when they do ask for more cash, women are less likely to get it than men are. Of those that did negotiate, 38% of women said they were only given the original offer compared to 31% of men.

Quote: “Queen Camilla”

We expected the biggest news about the invitations to the coronation for the UK’s King Charles III to be whether one made its way to Harry and Meghan’s mailbox in Montecito, but the wording of the invite itself is also getting headlines <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31079355.2922000/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80TUg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA3OTM1NS4yOTIyMDAw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc7f6e1cc>. Why? Because it refers to monarch’s wife as “Queen Camilla” rather than as “Queen Consort,” the title she has been using since Queen Elizabeth’s death. Given Camilla’s sometimes fraught relationship with the British press and public (and the late Princess Diana), only 7% of Britons thought she should become queen when the pair married in 2005—so her first official use of the title is drawing some attention.

In a historic day for the US, a former president appeared as a criminal defendant in a courtroom.

Donald Trump was charged <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31068001.3360432/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80SU0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA2ODAwMS4zMzYwNDMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3f5ade81> with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his arraignment at the Manhattan Criminal Court. He pleaded not guilty to each of them.

Breaking down the criminal case against Trump

We knew that Trump was indicted but not the specific charges against him, which were kept under seal…until yesterday. Here’s what we learned from the 16-page indictment:

The case is extremely complex. But at its core, Trump is accused of falsely labeling business records in order to get around campaign finance laws. And both those points are key, because for the charges to rise from a misdemeanor to a felony, prosecutors have to show that the defendant falsified business records with the intent of committing or concealing a separate crime.

So, what was Trump trying to conceal? According to prosecutors, reimbursement for a $130,000 payment Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, sent to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for silence about her alleged affair with Trump. The payment took place in the final days of his 2016 presidential bid, and Trump’s company falsely classified the series of transactions used to reimburse Cohen as legal expenses.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the architect of the case, has gotten heat from Republicans and (more quietly) some Democrats for bringing a case that possibly relies on an untested legal theory. In response, Bragg emphasized the importance of prosecuting the alleged business fraud due to New York’s status as a global center of commerce.

Next steps

Trump’s lightning-quick NYC trip concluded without taking in a Broadway show or $0.99 pizza slice: He was back in Florida by the evening to give a speech at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he accused Democrats of using law enforcement to intefere with elections. Trump, portraying himself as a victim of a liberal “witch hunt,” has already used his arraignment as a fundraising opportunity for his presidential campaign by selling “not-guilty” T-shirts <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31068001.3360432/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80SU4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA2ODAwMS4zMzYwNDMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Caaaf0e7c> that feature a fake mug shot (no mug shot was taken today).

It was a busy Tuesday for New York white-collar crime lawyers. Federal prosecutors arrested and charged <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31068001.3360432/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80SVk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA2ODAwMS4zMzYwNDMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf6d81f9f> Charlie Javice, founder of the now-defunct college financial planning site Frank, with four counts of fraud yesterday. The SEC also filed civil charges against Javice, who in 2019 was on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.

Quick refresher course: JPMorgan bought Frank for $175 million in 2021 to gain access to its huge email list. But a few months later, it sued Javice, claiming Frank’s client roster was bogus. JPMorgan said it realized the 4.25 million users the founder had touted were fudged when it tried to email 400,000 of them and 70% of the emails bounced back (can confirm: that’s bad). The bank alleges that less than 10% of Frank’s user base was real.

In their case, prosecutors claim that Javice tried to convince an employee to pad the customer numbers, which were allegedly closer to 300,000. But when the employee raised legal concerns, Javice assured them, “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits.”

Javice is hoping to make another “under 30” list…Three of the four counts each carry up to 30 years in prison.—MM

Women’s soccer scored a landmark investment as interest in women’s sports reaches new heights seemingly every day. Private equity firm Sixth Street committed to spend $125 million <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31068001.3360432/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80SjE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA2ODAwMS4zMzYwNDMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7ecec414> on a new Bay Area franchise for the National Women’s Soccer League.

It’s the biggest institutional investment made in a pro women’s sports team, Sixth Street said. Just how big is it? The $53 million the firm is spending on a league expansion fee is nearly 10x the $5 million expansion fee paid for a Kansas City franchise in 2021.

Big picture: Investors see major opportunities in the growth of women’s sports. With more eyeballs comes more lucrative TV contracts—and there have been plenty of eyeballs.

The LSU–Iowa NCAA tournament final drew an average of 9.9 million viewers on ESPN, smashing the record for the most-watched women’s college basketball game in history.

More than 87,000 people packed into Wembley Stadium in London for the 2022 Women’s Euro final, breaking the attendance record for a women’s or men’s Euro final.

More than 1.1 billion viewers around the world watched the 2019 Women’s World Cup. That number will almost certainly balloon for this summer’s tournament.

Looking ahead…Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman is (unsurprisingly) bullish on women’s soccer in the US. He predicts that the NWSL will reach parity “with every metric” with the MLS in 10 years.—NF

In a first for presidential history, Donald Trump will be charged with a crime today. The former president flew into his hometown, New York City, yesterday and is set to appear <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Rno_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb955e543> at the criminal courthouse in lower Manhattan to plead “not guilty” this afternoon.

What will go down today

Today’s courthouse visit is expected to be a short one: Trump will likely be released without bail soon after he’s arraigned.

The charges against him, which are currently in a sealed indictment, will be read at the arraignment—but we already know the prosecutor was investigating hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of Trump’s 2016 presidential run. Then he’ll enter a “not guilty” plea, according to his attorney.

Before the arraignment, the former president will be fingerprinted and possibly photographed for a mug shot, per the usual protocol. Mug shots aren’t released publicly in New York, and it’s unlikely that Trump will be handcuffed and perp-walked in front of the media, to the disappointment of NYC photojournalists.

But he won’t hide from the cameras: Trump plans to hold a press conference in the evening after he returns to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.

Some media outlets asked for permission to bring cameras into the courtroom, an exception to the rules that Trump’s lawyers say would create a “circus-like atmosphere” if granted.

Exactly the atmosphere the Big Apple is gearing up for

Authorities barricaded the courthouse and Trump Tower (where the ex-POTUS crashed for the night) in anticipation of Trump supporter protests and his critics’ counterprotests.

“Be on your best behavior,” Mayor Eric Adams said to one high-profile protester in town for the arraignment: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).

Looking ahead…Trump has lawyered up with some of the best names in the white-collar defense business, digging in for a long fight that will likely begin with a motion to dismiss the charges, which he claims are politically motivated.—SK

But the vote had a very low turnout with just over 100,000 people participating out of Paris’s ~1.38 million registered voters—even though scooter companies offered registered voters free rides.

NASA revealed its team <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Rkc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbcdce39b> yesterday for its upcoming mission around the moon—one small step toward humankind making its first lunar footprints since 1972.

The Artemis II flight test, scheduled for 2024, will ferry its four-person crew to the moon, make a pass close to its surface, and bring them back to Earth over the span of about ten days. It’s part two of a three-part mission to land astronauts on the moon’s surface in 2025—the first time since Neil Armstrong’s day. Part one was a success last year, when an unmanned spacecraft orbited the moon.

So, who’s going to space?

The four lucky Sailor Moons are: Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Hammock Koch, and Jeremy Hansen. The crew includes the first woman, the first person of color, and the first Canadian to ever go on a lunar mission.

Why one Canadian? Hansen’s spot on the Artemis II mission cost the Canadian Space Agency an arm and a—well, actually just an arm. In 2020, the CSA sealed the deal <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Rkg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1960a672> by agreeing to give NASA a robotic arm the agency needed for its small, moon-orbiting space station.

In its latest push into audio, Apple launched a dedicated app for classical music last week. And classical music snobs…actually like it <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Rk4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C368ac499>.

Here’s why: The app, called Apple Music Classical, lets you find the classical music you want to listen to. While that doesn’t sound earth-shattering, it is a huge deal, because searching for classical music on services like Spotify was worse than using Bing pre-ChatGPT.

The issue is classical music’s metadata—how it’s labeled and categorized.

Streaming apps are optimized for pop songs that have limited metadata (song/artist/album, typically).

But a piece of classical music has a lot more metadata linked to it, including the composer, the orchestra, the conductor, the movement, the nickname, and the key.

So, it gets messy. Imagine sifting through more than 490 covers of a Dua Lipa track for your favorite rendition. That’s how many recordings of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 are on Apple <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Rk8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceb9f8e5f>, CNET notes.

To help it fix the metadata problem, Apple bought Primephonic, a Dutch startup that had built the back-end data infrastructure needed to surface the most useful search results.

Tack on human editors curating their favorite recordings, and Apple’s hoping its new app will attract both the Lydia Tár types and newbies looking to see what all the Mozart fuss is about.—NF

Key performance indicators A chicken sandwich with chicken that's too big Hannah Minn
Stat: Despite what the wing slingers at Hooters would have you believe, when it comes to chicken breasts, bigger isn’t always better. Fast-food joints like KFC and Chick-fil-A need four-pound chickens to make their chicken sandwiches, but they’re in short supply <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31052283.103981/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80RlM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA1MjI4My4xMDM5ODE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6b9feadf> as producers have shifted their focus to larger birds (they cost about the same amount to raise, but the bigger birds sell for more). Data from the Dept. of Agriculture shows that small chickens accounted for almost 30% of chickens slaughtered weekly in 2005 but only ~15% in 2023, per the WSJ.

Ron DeSantis. To recap: Disney spoke out against the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, prompting the governor to install a new board to govern the special tax district that includes Disney World (the board was picked by Disney, not the state, for the previous 55 years)—but Disney outfoxed DeSantis with a legal maneuver that stripped the new board of power. DeSantis has asked the state’s inspector general to determine whether that legal move was…legal.

Good morning. I don’t wanna steal any thunder from the Week Ahead section, but when putting together this newsletter, I was thinking about just how packed this first week of April is: Trump’s arraignment tomorrow, Passover, Easter prep, the Masters, and probably a bunch of unexpected things that will pop up. Friday will be here before we know it.

Endeavor Group, the parent company of UFC, is nearing a blockbuster deal to buy WWE <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QkM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceb25ed19>and could announce an agreement imminently, CNBC reported yesterday, which coincidentally(?) was the second day of WrestleMania, WWE’s biggest event.

A deal would mean that three huge personalities in media—Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel, UFC President Dana White, and WWE Executive Chairman Vince McMahon—will be working at the same company. Not even Erik Spoelstra could manage all that ego in one office.

A deal would also spawn a combat sports entertainment behemoth. WWE would have an enterprise value of $9.3 billion in the acquisition, CNBC reported, a significant premium over its current market value of $6.79 billion. And UFC, the largest global mixed martial arts organization, would be valued at more than $12 billion.

So, how would this all shake out?

The plan is to combine WWE and UFC into one publicly traded firm.

Emanuel, a Hollywood power broker, would remain CEO of Endeavor and also lead the new company.

Dana White would stay president of UFC and WWE CEO Nick Khan will become president of the wrestling unit.

But it’s McMahon who comes out of this impending deal looking like a Logan Roy-level mastermind. With Endeavor scooping up 51% of the new company, he’ll cash out on the humble wrestling promotion he bought from his dad <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QkQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceb6f98de> in 1982 for $1 million and built into an entertainment juggernaut. McMahon had been shopping around WWE for months, and raised eyebrows when he asked $9 billion for his company. But Endeavor came in from the top rope to give him what he was looking for...and more.

There is controversy surrounding these big personalities

McMahon had temporarily retired in July following a scandal over hush money payments sent to women who accused him of sexual harassment and misconduct. White, meanwhile, was filmed slapping his wife on New Year’s Eve 2022 during an argument (he apologized for his behavior).

Bottom line: Many corporate mergers come labeled with imagined “synergies,” but a UFC–WWE tie-up might truly be a 1+1=3 scenario. WWE could piggyback off of UFC’s success in bringing in sponsorship revenue, and it’s also exploring legalizing betting on its matches in several states.

Just five months after the US brought home Brittney Griner from Russian detention, it’s facing another prisoner’s dilemma following the brazen arrest <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Qk4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cea82376d> of American journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges last week.

Outrage at Russia’s action grew over the weekend. In a rare phone call, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that Gershkovich’s detention was unacceptable <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80Qk8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6b7182f5> and demanded Russia release him and another detained American, Paul Whelan.

Top editors at 38 news outlets (including the Wall Street Journal, where Gershkovich works) called for Gershkovich to be immediately released <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QlA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4c5de2e0> and accused Russia of “sending the message that journalism within your borders is criminalized.” The WSJ vehemently denies the allegations against its reporter.

Who is Gershkovich? A 31-year-old son of Soviet émigrés, he developed a deep interest in Russia and has been working there as a journalist since 2017. Gershkovich was also a talented soccer player: At his alma mater, Bowdoin College, he netted a penalty kick <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31041265.2944781/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QlI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTA0MTI2NS4yOTQ0Nzgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4d38511c> to win an NCAA tournament game.

Stock spotlight: It’s too soon to say what impact the indictment of Donald Trump will have on his campaign, but it has already given a boost to Digital World Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that plans to merge with Trump’s Truth Social.

With the first quarter of 2023 behind us, we now know that if you’d visited a good Tarot card reader on New Year’s Day, they would’ve told you to park your cash in tech stocks and avoid bank shares.

Despite wild fluctuation due to continuous rate hikes from the Fed and an unexpected bank panic, stocks and bonds managed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31029240.2950477/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QVA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAyOTI0MC4yOTUwNDc3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce8ee8bbe> to turn in a pretty, pretty, pretty good performance for the quarter. The S&P 500 gained 7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.

But tech is indisputably the honors students.

Top of the class

Wall Street rewarded tech companies’ layoffs and other cost cutting measures, giving tech stocks a resurgence. And as ChatGPT becomes a household name, investors clearly have their money on generative AI being the next big bet.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose a whopping 18% since January 1, its largest quarterly gain in two years.

Stocks of the tech giants leading the charge in AI-powered search, Microsoft and Alphabet, are up 20% and 16%, respectively.

And in an I-told-you-so triumph for your crypto-obsessed cousin, Bitcoin has surged 72%.

Meanwhile, the second- and third-largest bank collapses in US history happening within 48 hours hurt *drumroll please*…banks.

The remedial bunch

Bank stocks were a delight for short sellers, who made $2 billion betting against the sector in the past three months.

Smaller institutions were most badly injured by the bank panic: The SPRD S&P Regional Banking ETF, which consists of non-behemoth banks, had more than a quarter of its value wiped out in Q1.

Large banks are feeling the pinch of rising interest rates: Global merger and acquisition deals suffered the biggest first-quarter decline since 2001, according to the Financial Times and Refinitiv.

Looking ahead: While Q1 proved just about anything can happen, it’s safe to bet that the market’s future performance largely hinges on what Jerome Powell and his central bankers decide what to do next.—SK

Your Trump indictment update: The criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump remains under wraps, but information about the unprecedented situation keeps trickling out.

Many prominent Republicans have decried the case against the ex-commander-in-chief, but one statement struck some as a little lackluster: Ivanka Trump’s Insta said “I love my father, and I love my country. Today, I am pained for both.”

Dominion gets an edge in its $1.6b case against Fox.

He also handed Dominion an advantage going into that trial, finding that the evidence showed it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the statements made on air by Fox News personalities about the company's equipment were true and that the company’s reputation was damaged. To win, Dominion will still need to prove that Fox knew the statements were false or recklessly disregarded the truth.

Because most do currently rely on supplies from China, very few EVs will remain eligible for the full credit.

The regulator is primarily concerned that ChatGPT collects and stores Italian users’ personal data without their permission. It also called out the chatbot’s lack of age verification.

AI chatbots *do* have a lot of data in their trunk

The ban stems from a recent accidental leak of user conversations with ChatGPT. But things could get even thornier if the regulator decides to also delve into the other kind of data the system stores. AI systems like ChatGPT make huge sweeps of the internet and feed all that info into their underlying algorithms. Sorting out what data out of that info glut belongs to Italian citizens if necessary would be…complicated.

And other regulatory authorities may soon secondo similar demands:

The EU and UK are working on plans to regulate AI.

Also this week, more than 1,000 tech leaders and AI experts signed a controversial open letter calling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31029240.2950477/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QVk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAyOTI0MC4yOTUwNDc3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2B9450dd26> for a six-month pause on all AI projects.

RIP to your free blue check mark and all the perks that came with it (i.e., more reply guys). Today Twitter will start phasing out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31029240.2950477/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QjE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAyOTI0MC4yOTUwNDc3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C41f5b932> the verification badge for anyone not willing to pay $8 a month for Twitter Blue.

And that monthly fee is a relative bargain: Larger institutions will have to pay at least $1,000 a month for verification. Twitter CEO Elon Musk also tweeted that as of April 15, your For You feed will only recommend content from paid accounts and people you follow.

There is an exception for the site’s top 500 advertisers and 10,000 most followed organizations (including YouTube, NASA, CNN, ESPN, and the New York Times), which will get to keep their checkmarks without paying up.

Other big accounts are out: Notable figures and outlets, from LeBron James to the White House, have said they won't be paying for verification, which should make for an interesting feed: One researcher found <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31029240.2950477/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80QjI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAyOTI0MC4yOTUwNDc3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2B4d81f525> that roughly half of the 220,000 Twitter Blue subscribers have less than 1,000 followers.

But Musk needs a win. And Twitter needs cash: The company’s value has been halved from the $44 billion since he bought it in October.—MM

Eschewing British understatement, he also noted that it’s a particularly bad look for the US, since the UK doesn’t even have the best life expectancy in Europe.

Well, we’re back to living in unprecedented times. In a first for a former US president, Donald Trump was indicted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80d2Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4dc964d0> on criminal charges by a New York grand jury yesterday, his lawyers and prosecutors said.

To call this explosive doesn’t do justice to TNT—it will become the defining plotline of the 2024 presidential race, which Trump has already entered in his bid to reclaim the White House.

So, what are the charges?

No one actually knows yet. Charges are sometimes kept under wraps until the defendant makes their first appearance in court (known as an arraignment). Trump is expected to be arraigned in New York City next Tuesday, according to CNN.

But we do know what the investigation centered on: $130,000 in hush money sent to porn star Stormy Daniels by Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Daniels claims to have had an affair with Trump—which he denies, along with the allegations that he was involved in paying her to keep quiet. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, is accusing Trump and his company of falsifying business records to hide this payment.

An indictment is just the beginning of the process for the government to make a criminal case—and an eventual conviction is no slam dunk <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80d2U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C02208d39>. It relies on a “novel legal theory” that “has never been tested in court,” according to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

To prove Trump committed a felony, prosecutors will have to demonstrate that he falsified these records to cover up or commit a seperate crime.

Everyone chimed in

Following the indictment, both political parties staked out their positions.

Democrats said the charges show that the US justice system works as designed to hold the powerful to account and that no one, not even a former president, is above the law.

Republicans, echoing Trump’s rebuttal, claimed it was a political hit job by Dems to weaken his 2024 prospects against President Biden. Trump will likely lean into this “witch hunt” theme on the campaign trail, he's already called the indictment “Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history.”

What happens next: When Trump arrives in New York next week for his arraignment, he’ll be fingerprinted and have a mug shot taken (which will easily become the most viral picture of all time if made public).

This could also be the first of several indictments to come through the pipeline for Trump. He’s being investigated in three other criminal probes, including one over his alleged mishandling of classified documents.—NF

Russia arrests American journalist for alleged espionage. A reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich, was arrested Wednesday <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80dlo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf974e367> in the city of Yekaterinburg for allegedly investigating Russian military secrets for the US. It’s the first time an American journalist has been detained on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War and a sign of escalating tensions between the rival countries as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. The WSJ said it “vehemently denies the allegations,” and the White House also condemned <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80di0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cea83d738> Russia’s “targeting of American citizens.”

A court nixed an Obamacare preventative care mandate.

The ruling could affect nearly 100 million Americans who use one or more of these ACA-covered services. The ruling came in a lawsuit that argued the mandate forces religious employers to cover drugs that “encourage homosexual behavior, prostitution, sexual promiscuity, and intravenous drug use.” The Biden administration is expected to appeal, and insurers are still likely to offer this coverage for now. Wall Street bonuses slashed. If your I-banking friend is summering in Havasu instead of the Hamptons this year, it may be because the average Wall Street bonus plunged by 26% <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80d2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbd6bb25d> in 2022 to $176,700. This drop, which is the biggest since 2008, is a consequence of both a slowdown in dealmaking and cost-cutting efforts by banks. There were only 71 Wall Street-led IPOs last year that raised a total of $7.7 billion—a tiny fraction of the $142 billion raised by IPOs in 2021. Wall Street bonuses typically account for more than 75% of total comp for NYC-based bankers and traders, per the Financial Times.

Just hours after the world learned that Trump had been indicted, another headline-grabbing legal battle reached its conclusion: A jury found Gwyneth Paltrow not at fault <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80d2s_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd793cc8c> for a 2016 ski collision in Utah that injured retired optometrist Terry Sanderson, who sued her for $300,000.

Paltrow not only won the $1 she requested in her countersuit against Sanderson, but she also won the internet. The eight-day trial inspired an avalanche of TikToks and memes that framed Paltrow, an actor and business mogul, as a heroic figure in this drama.

Why was the trial so viral? Mainly because it produced so many soundbites that seemed like they were lifted from a White Lotus episode skewering the wealthy and aloof.

After being asked how the crash inconvenienced her, Paltrow told the courtroom, “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”

Paltrow was questioned about “intimate” gifts she had given to Taylor Swift.

Sanderson’s witnesses said that following the crash, he was unable to enjoy wine tastings.

Big picture: Having built her Goop empire on outrageously expensive candles and scientifically murky wellness advice, Paltrow has been preparing for the role of out-of-touch rich woman in court for a long time.—MM

It looks like Disney has added a new character to the Magic Kingdom: the troll.

The company quietly entered agreements <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31016365.2945901/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80dlU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAxNjM2NS4yOTQ1OTAx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cdc62044b> that rendered the board Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hand-picked to govern the special tax district surrounding Disney World nearly powerless.

Bewildered board members only learned about these agreements this week, and one said they planned to “correct” Disney’s behind-the-scenes sleight of hand. Disney, though, asserts it was all kosher.

How did we get here? For 55 years, the state allowed Disney to make its own rules for developing the land where its theme parks sit. But after the company criticized the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis installed his own board to run the district.

With the new board in place, it looked like DeSantis had won…until Disney pulled a Mulan-like switcheroo. When the board was still Disney-controlled, it entered into restrictive covenants for the land that:

Bar the new board from using the Disney name or any of the company’s IP, including Mickey Mouse.

Give Disney the right to review any proposed changes to properties in the district.

And, fittingly for a company synonymous with princesses, Disney made the agreements valid until “21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, king of England.”—AR

The tech-focused index ended the day up more than 20% from its low at the end of December, boosted by big rallies from Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Investors also seemed less nervous about the banking industry as lawmakers grilled regulators for the second day in a row.

Elon Musk and other tech leaders signed an open letter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cVQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfad60a4a> calling on developers to “pause giant AI experiments.” The petition, which more than 1,000 folks have signed, warns that artificial intelligence poses “profound risks to society and humanity” and asks AI researchers to put their projects on ice for at least six months.

That’s asking a lot: OpenAI launched the latest version of its artificially intelligent chatbot, ChatGPT 4, this month; Google started rolling out its AI chatbot called Bard last week; and Microsoft added AI capabilities to its Bing search engine in February. Goldman Sachs even shared a report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cVU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca5b13033> on Monday that said AI could boost worker productivity so much that annual world GDP would jump by 7%.

So, why stop the progress now?

For Frankensteinian reasons: Per the letter, developers are “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one—not even their creators—can understand, predict, or reliably control.”

The letter calls out AI systems’ tendency toward confidently pumping out misinformation and escalates quickly to discuss AI’s potential to automate jobs and “outsmart” and “replace us” to the point that we “risk loss of control of our civilization.” *Sips coffee.*

It was penned by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on mitigating existential threats <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb71c1d29> to humanity, particularly AI. Notable signatories besides Musk include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and politician Andrew Yang.

To ensure AI ends up being more Wall-E than Skynet, the letter asks AI labs to use what it calls an “AI summer” break to create and implement safety protocols that ramp up oversight on the development of artificially intelligent systems. If not, it asks governments to step in and force the pause.

Yeah, but…other experts, including Bing’s AI chatbot <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cVc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cef694eb0> (!), say that even if the tech has issues, a pause isn’t the right solution. Critics say the letter contributes to “AI hype” and overfocuses on the threat to knowledge workers above other concerns.—JW

The move follows the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans due to drug overdoses last year.

The company didn’t explain its decision to yank its complaint, which stated that the design was too similar to its logo, but Reuters reported it was because the concern could be misconstrued as opposition to BLM’s goals. The sportswear brand is likely looking to avoid that kind of attention after parting ways with Kanye West over his racist and antisemitic statements.

Disney described the termination as part of its recent decision to lay off 7,000 employees (it also cut the entire Marvel Entertainment unit he ran, which is distinct from the Marvel Studios unit that makes all those blockbusters). But Perlmutter wasn’t just any Disney employee, and he’d recently butted heads with CEO Bob Iger by backing activist investor Nelson Peltz’s bid to get a seat on the company’s board.

Interim Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz appeared <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cjI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf7897c29> at a Senate hearing yesterday about the company’s role in the wave of unionization hitting its coffee shops—something he only agreed to after Sen. Bernie Sanders threatened to subpoena him into the hot seat. And Sanders was not interested in a light roast: He accused the coffee company of “the most aggressive and illegal union-busting campaign in the modern history of our country.”

In yesterday’s hearing, Schultz responded to the accusations, saying, “Starbucks coffee company, unequivocally…has not broken the law.”

But it’s no secret that Starbucks has fought unionization efforts. Since fall 2021, 290 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize. In that time, Starbucks Workers United has filed 500+ charges of unfair labor practices against the company, and judges have ruled that Starbucks broke federal labor law 130 times.

Bernie’s not the only outsider getting involved:

Republican lawmakers have voiced support for Starbucks, and a Republican-led committee subpoenaed the National Labor Relations Board for records. They believe the federal agency improperly handled a union election in Kansas City.

Plus, Starbucks investors voted last week on whether to have a third-party group look into the company’s alleged union busting, but have not released the vote counts publicly.

Looking ahead…Starbucks has yet to agree to any union contracts, and even with a new CEO, the coffee chain is unlikely to reverse course and accept the union any time soon.—MM

That makeover is the work of Steve Cohen, a hedge fund billionaire who bought the Mets for $2.4 billion in 2020. This offseason, Cohen maxed out his AmEx Black Card on free agents to bring the team’s projected 2023 payroll to ~$370 million, shattering the MLB record.

For comparison, the team with the second-biggest payroll is the Yankees, who are spending about $210 million on players this year.

We should mention the Mets are also expected to owe a record luxury tax of ~$100 million.

What’s Cohen’s deal? If you’ve seen the show Billions, the investor Bobby Axelrod is loosely based on him. In 2013, Cohen’s hedge fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to insider trading, resulting in Cohen paying $1.8 billion in fines and getting temporarily banned from managing money for clients.

Zoom out: MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said this week that Cohen’s unheard-of spending spree has “real benefits for the game,” but also widens the gap between the small- and large-market teams. Others say Cohen isn’t the problem—other ultrawealthy owners should be required to open up their wallets just like he has.—NF

Stat: Getting into an Ivy League school is hard, but paying for it may be even harder. The cost of attending classes in a Gothic building while living in a dorm with cinderblock walls is approaching $90,000 per year <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/31001235.2956058/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80cmM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMTAwMTIzNS4yOTU2MDU4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccff49fb9>, according to Bloomberg. While ~50% of students at these institutions receive financial aid (enough that one economist said the price of attendance has actually gone down for students from households making less than $125k), it still puts the sticker price for becoming someone people roll their eyes at when you name-drop your school above the annual income of many US families.

Good morning. According to the New York Times, there is apparently a monthly Ryan Meetup for Ryans at Ryan Maguire’s Bar & Restaurant in Manhattan—no non-Ryans allowed.

This Ryan congress builds on a rich tradition of people gathering for no apparent reason other than they share the first name on their birth certificate.

In the past two years, Joshes have convened in Nebraska for the annual “Josh Fight” to raise money for charity.

But our favorite same-name meetup happened at a UK pub in 2019, where 433 Nigels got together to “celebrate Nigelness” before the name goes extinct. No one in the country named their baby Nigel in 2020.

The feature, Apple Pay Later, was introduced to randomly selected Apple Pay users and will become available to more customers over the next few months.

How it works: When using Apple Pay to buy something, users can pay for $50–$1,000 purchases in four payments over six weeks with no interest or fees.

It’s a weird time to get into BNPL

Rewind to peak Covid, when digital layaway companies were hotter than matching sweatsuits. In 2021, Swedish BNPL company Klarna was Europe’s most valuable fintech startup at a valuation of $45.6 billion. The same year, Block (formerly Square) bought the Australian BNPL company Afterpay for a staggering $30 billion.

But eye-popping valuations didn’t stick around for long. By mid-2022, rising interest rates strained BNPL companies’ business models, and regulators started cracking down on potentially predatory lending practices. Plus, the BNPL field has gotten more crowded than an Old Navy during the 2010 $1 flip-flop sale as established companies like Walmart and PayPal tried to cash in on the gold rush.

But now, the state of BNPL looks more like…an Old Navy the day after the $1 flip-flop sale. Klarna’s valuation plummeted 85% to just $6.7 billion in a July 2022 funding round. And when the short seller Hindenburg accused <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30990196.3341713/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80blQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk5MDE5Ni4zMzQxNzEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4de07c9f> Block of being ultra-sketchy in a scathing report last week, it said that acquiring Afterpay was actually a very bad idea, btw, because the company was “designed in a way that avoided responsible lending rules.”

Apple sees opportunity among the ruins

While unprofitable BNPL startups watch their VC drips dry up, the tech behemoth is cool with losing money on its Apple Pay Later feature for a while. It’s got iPhone money. And Apple has been playing the long game in its ultimate goal of replacing your leather wallet completely. In October 2014, when Apple Pay was first introduced, 3% of retailers in the US used its contactless payment service. Now, over 85% of retailers accept Apple Pay.—MM

Accountants, survey researchers, and interpreters could see a sizable chunk of their day-to-day work get outsourced to ChatGPT, according to a study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30990196.3341713/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80bi0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk5MDE5Ni4zMzQxNzEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C09f4056d> published by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.

If you’re not eager to compete with a language model for a job, you might want to consider physical labor. The study found that for tire repairers, meatpackers, and athletes, ChatGPT was about as impactful as a degree in metaverse real estate management.

Ultimately, the study found the most GPT-able jobs to be those performed by knowledge workers, particularly ones who spend their days coding and writing .

The paper stopped short of predicting how quickly typing prompts into AI tools could become part of the workflow of various jobs. But it’s already happening at some workplaces: One digital artist went viral recently by lamenting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30990196.3341713/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80bl8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk5MDE5Ni4zMzQxNzEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C44da36ea> how their job went from creating original art to entering prompts into the text-to-image AI app Midjourney and editing its output in a matter of weeks.

Looking ahead…almost 1 in 5 US employees could have at least half of their work tasks disrupted by ChatGPT, per the study. And Goldman Sachs estimates that AI chatbots might affect 300 million full-time workers across the major economies.—SK

The Australian food company Vow said yesterday that it’s made a meatball <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30990196.3341713/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80bnc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk5MDE5Ni4zMzQxNzEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C387ee1af> from the extinct woolly mammoth.

This wasn’t the result of a freezer cleanup 10,000 years overdue. Vow “grows” unconventional meat in a lab to offer a protein alternative to slaughtered animals and reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture.

To make the mammoth meatball, Vow took the DNA sequence of a mammoth’s muscle protein, added a splash of elephant DNA, and then inserted that completed gene into a sheep muscle cell, where it was grown (along with many more sheep genes) into 400 grams of meat. Add salt to taste.

So, why mammoth? The animal probably wasn’t chosen because it’s particularly tender or goes well with marinara—unfortunately, Neanderthal Guy Fieri didn’t leave a review.

Instead, the mammoth was selected to generate marketing buzz around Vow’s mission. The idea was the brainchild of creative agency Wunderman Thompson, whose global chief creative officer,​​ Bas Korsten, told the Guardian that mammoth meatballs were intended to “start a conversation” about the harmful environmental impact of meat consumption.

Looking ahead…the mammoth meatball won’t be coming to an Ikea near you anytime soon. But Vow is hoping to get its first cultivated meat product, Japanese quail, sold in restaurants in Singapore this year.—NF

Yes, even Vatican City (which is one-seventh the size of Central Park) has a national soccer team. But some Marshall Islands soccer boosters are aiming to establish a team and one day upset Brazil at the World Cup. Okay, maybe their ambitions don’t extend that far, but they do want to use soccer to raise awareness about climate change’s impacts on this cluster of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Projections show that 40% of the capital island of Majuro will be underwater by 2030.

Good morning. Yesterday, at a school in Nashville, three children and three adults were killed in the US’ 129th mass shooting of the year, which is defined by the Gun Violence Archive as an episode of gun violence where four or more people are shot at a time. That’s equivalent to ~10 mass shootings per week in 2023, or almost two per day.—Sam Klebanov, Neal Freyman, Jamie Wilde, Abby Rubenstein

Shooting at Nashville elementary school leaves six dead. Three children and three adults were killed yesterday in a shooting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80aVo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2e294c8c> at The Covenant School, a private Presbyterian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee.The six victims have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, who were nine years old, and Cynthia Peak, Mike Hill, and Katherine Koonce, adults in their early sixties. Koonce is believed to have been the head of the school.

The shooter was also killed while exchanging fire with police. The suspected attacker was identified by police as a 28 year-old former student of the school. According to police <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80anM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce1d9769e>, the shooter, who entered the school with at least two assault-style rifles and a handgun, had written a manifesto and drawn detailed maps of the school before the attacks. In the aftermath of the attack, there was confusion regarding the assailant’s gender because police originally said the alleged shooter was a woman before saying the shooter was transgender and used male pronouns in recent LinkedIn postings.

The decision came after strikes and mass protests brought the country to a standstill.

“Pope Francis? More like Pope fashionista ” was everyone’s reaction this weekend to a viral photo of the pontiff sporting a stylish puffer jacket looking like he marched straight out of Milan fashion week. However, to the disappointment of the Very Online of all creeds, the image turned out to be an AI-generated deepfake.

But before its authenticity was debunked, millions of people (including half of our editorial team) took the realistic-looking image at face value and subsequently felt mildly embarrassed at being so easily duped.

Where it came from: “Balenciaga Pope” was brought to us by Midjourney, an artificial intelligence app that generates images from text prompts. It was created and posted to Reddit by a user who was apparently just trying to have a laugh while tripping on magic mushrooms <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ajE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C550a2355>, per BuzzFeed.

What gives it away: Upon closer inspection, the picture does offer some clues that it isn’t actually a candid shot snapped by a paparazzi on the streets of Vatican City. Some tell-tale signs:

The Pope’s glasses look like they're melting onto his face.

The crucifix appears somewhat deformed.

Why people are still unnerved

Midjourney’s ability to have us marveling at the Pope’s chic ’fit got people thinking about what rapid advances in hyperrealistic AI art mean for our post-truth world. Web culture journalist Ryan Broderick dubbed the papal hoax the first “mass-level AI misinformation case.”

Another recent, viral, AI-made image showed it could be used to spread false narratives for more politically polarizing topics than the pope's fashion choices. Investigative journalist Eliot Higgins used Midjourney to churn out a series of images depicting former President Donald Trump getting arrested after an on-foot police chase, amid talk of his impending indictment (Higgins later got banned from Midjourney for doing so).

Looking ahead… AI expert Henry Ajder told Business Insider he’s urging AI companies to embed safeguards—like watermarks for manipulated images and disclaimers for videos—into the technology to prevent it from being weaponized for fake news.—SK

Encouraged customers to access Binance via virtual private networks (VPNs), allowing them to make unpermitted trades from the US.

Built a base of high-net-worth “VIP” customers and gave them a heads-up when law enforcement looked into their assets.

The East Coast–West Coast rivalry is typically associated with rappers or sports teams, but now the divisions are extending to…the housing market.

Just like the sun, home prices are dropping in the West while rising in the East, according to the Wall Street Journal <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80aVI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2653694d>. This stark geographical split is extremely unusual, and highlights Covid’s role in shuffling people around the country in weird ways. The key stats:

West of Texas (but including Austin), home prices in the 12 major housing markets fell in January on an annual basis, data from Black Knight showed.

But home prices increased in the 37 largest metros east of Colorado (excluding Austin).

What’s going on? Western “Zoom Towns” that welcomed an influx of residents during the pandemic (think Boise) saw their bubbly home prices start to pop as mortgage rates spiked. Plus, the tech hubs that were so dang unaffordable even before Covid (SF, San Jose) have taken a hit from the recent downturn in the sector.

Meanwhile, on the East Coast, consistent job growth <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80anI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4becbc8f>, tight housing inventory, and the fact that many cities there didn’t see a ludicrous price boom during Covid are helping push prices higher.

Big picture: Nationally, the median home price dropped annually <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80aVM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce9485996> in February for the first time in more than a decade, and experts predict more year over year declines in many markets.—NF

Key Performance Indicators Keanu Reeves at the John Wick premiere Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images
Stat: John Wick is a man of focus, commitment, and sheer will—but very few words. The puppy-loving hitman played by Keanu Reeves says just 380 words <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30975626.3339790/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80amM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk3NTYyNi4zMzM5Nzkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7016adad> in John Wick: Chapter 4, despite the film’s nearly three-hour run time, according to the WSJ. Reeves himself hacked the dialogue down, the film’s director said, and 27% of the 103 lines spoken by Wick in the final cut are a single word. If reports that the actor was paid $15 million to reprise the role are accurate, that’s $39,473 per word.

Good morning. Heads up—a rare alignment of five planets will be visible in the night sky this week, but Tuesday evening will be your best bet. Just head outside right after sunset, look west, and you’ll see Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus appear to line up in an arc shape below the crescent moon. Anyone on Earth should be able to see it, even if you’re living in a city with light pollution.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu sacked his defense minister yesterday, sparking large-scale protests and escalating a crisis <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZWg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccabac66f> that’s now freezing much of its economy.

The country’s largest trade union group, which represents almost 800,000 workers across a range of industries, announced a strike, halting departures at Ben Gurion Airport and leaving some hospitals with reduced staff. The country’s research universities are also suspending classes indefinitely beginning today.

How we got here

Israelis have been staging mass protests for months against the hard-right coalition government’s plan to overhaul a judiciary that it claims has become too interventionist. Critics say this proposal, which gives the coalition government the final word over judicial appointments, would weaken Israel’s checks and balances and erode its democracy.

And there are a lot of critics—including military reservists in elite units who said they wouldn’t show up for duty. That prompted so much alarm in military circles that on Saturday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a senior member of Netanyahu’s political party, publicly called <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZWk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C13859afa> on the government to delay its overhaul.

The plan presents “a clear and immediate and tangible danger to the security of the state—I shall not be a party to this,” Gallant said. Netanyahu fired him the next day.

Political crisis is not good for business

You typically don’t see corporate elites hitting the streets to demonstrate, but that’s been happening in Israel as the business community warns that the judiciary reforms would severely damage the country’s economy <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZWo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C32ec54f4>—specifically its vaunted high-tech sector.

Israel has prided itself as the “startup nation” thanks to its world-famous tech ecosystem that churns out unicorns. But many business leaders—from major bank CEOs to startup founders—argue that the government’s judiciary plans would weaken Israel’s legal institutions, potentially lead to a credit rating downgrade, and dry up the foreign investment upon which these startups depend. An estimated 90% of the high-tech sector is funded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZWs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce752f828> by investors outside of Israel, per The Guardian.

The plan has even attracted critics in the US. More than 50 leading economists at American universities wrote a letter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZWw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C08546483> to Netanyahu stressing how an independent judiciary is critical to economic growth. They said his overhaul is “detrimental” to the economic cause.

Looking ahead…all eyes are on Netanyahu’s next move.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has emerged as a Hero of the People after he tangled with infuriated lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week.

On Wall Street, the verdict was damning: One tech analyst called the hearing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZXY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce2579536>, in which lawmakers berated Chew for about five hours, a “disaster” for TikTok that will only accelerate a ban in the US or a forced sale by Chinese parent company ByteDance.

But TikTok users watching the hearing saw something completely different: a sympathetic figure being unfairly singled out by tech-illiterate, disrespectful politicians.

Almost immediately after the hearing, videos making fun of lawmakers and hailing Chew’s “I’m him <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZXc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C74eb16b6>” performance went viral on TikTok. Most of the tributes have been thirst traps commenting on Chew’s looks—“TikTok Zaddy fighting for us,” one user wrote, and another commented, “Yall fr simping for the CEO of TikTok,” Business Insider reported <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZXg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C13c90131>.

Why it matters: The backlash to lawmakers’ treatment of Chew could make a ban even more politically toxic. TikTok reported that 150 million Americans use the app monthly, equivalent to 45% of the US population. And those who do use TikTok are far less likely to support a ban than non-TikTok users. According to a Washington Post survey <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30964456.3343855/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80ZXk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk2NDQ1Ni4zMzQzODU1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C48fc04b7>, 54% of daily TikTok users oppose a ban, while 54% of respondents who hadn’t used TikTok in the past month support a ban.

People in Lebanon woke up to that reality on Sunday after caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati delayed a clock change until the end of Ramadan. However, private institutions like TV stations and businesses are not abiding by it. So, some folks in Lebanon are living in this Twilight Zone where they’ve got two meetings one hour apart that actually take place at the same time.

At a spicy hearing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OE4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C353f988c> on Capitol Hill yesterday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew fought for the app’s survival in the US.

With calls to ban TikTok gaining momentum, the company dispatched its head honcho—a Harvard Business School grad—to alleviate concerns that the Chinese-owned social media app could be used as a spying tool far more potent than any balloon.

He didn’t make much progress

The first lawmaker to speak, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, fired up the grill by calling for a ban on TikTok: “ByteDance is beholden to the CCP, and ByteDance and TikTok are one and the same,” she said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to force ByteDance (TikTok’s parent company) to give it information.

In his testimony, Chew didn’t exactly instill confidence that TikTok had a firewall against China. For instance, he couldn’t unequivocally deny that Chinese ByteDance employees can access US user data. “I think quite frankly your testimony has raised more questions for me than answers,” Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester said.

But lawmakers didn’t just focus on TikTok’s ties to China. They attacked the app over problems like misinformation, addiction, and dangerous viral trends—issues that Chew pointed out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OE8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce0f80525> plague US social media companies as well.

TikTok has launched a full-court press to defend itself

Not only in the halls of Congress, but also in the court of public opinion.

This week, TikTok sent an army of influencers to Washington, DC, to make the case that the app was a net positive for society and allowed them and other creators to make a living.

Chew also noted that TikTok now has 150 million monthly users in the US, equivalent to 45% of the population. His not-so-subtle message: Do you really think you can take away something nearly half of Americans love and still expect to be reelected?

Still, analysts watching the hearing gave Chew’s performance two thumbs down. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called it a “disaster <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OFA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C48d1fce5>” that only accelerates a TikTok ban or a sale.

Where things stand: The Biden administration has demanded that ByteDance sell its stake in TikTok or get booted from the US. China has responded that it will “firmly oppose” a forced sale.—NF

Hindenburg Research sank its teeth into its next victim: Block, a fintech giant led by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The short seller, known for digging up corporate dirt, released a report yesterday alleging that Block is letting fraud flourish <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OFg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2a6d88bd> on its mobile payment service Cash App to pad its growth data.

Block’s stock crumpled nearly 15% after Hindenburg released its two-year investigation. The biggest allegations:

According to Hindenburg, former Cash App employees estimate that 40%–75% of accounts on the app were either fake or fraudulent and could be traced back to one person.

It also claimed Cash App played host to numerous scams conducted by users involving Covid stimulus and unemployment payments.

Hindenburg pointed to rappers bragging about paying for drugs—and in one case, potentially murder—via Cash App in their songs.

Block called the report “inaccurate and misleading” and threatened potential legal action.

The idea arose during routine negotiations between the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which reps studios, over writers’ pay <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OTI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C78902636>. And while letting ChatGPT in the writers room sounds like a job threat, the details of the WGA’s proposal could ensure we won’t see a robot giving an Oscars speech anytime soon.

AI could do some of the work but get none of the credit

The union tweeted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30940958.2951114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80OTM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDk0MDk1OC4yOTUxMTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd2996610> that it considers AI to be merely “research material,” noting that “AI software does not create anything. It generates a regurgitation of what it’s fed.”

Therefore, the WGA proposes that AI could be used to help write scripts. But the writer who turns AI-generated text into a show or movie would get all the credit—and compensation.

Zoom out: Creative industries everywhere are discussing what guardrails should be established around using AI to produce content. While the WGA’s proposal could set a precedent for materials created with AI, some are wondering…what happens when AI gets good enough to write a screenplay without a human co-writer?—JW

Good morning. It’s a big day: TikTok’s CEO is testifying on Capitol Hill, the men’s NCAA tournament resumes with the Sweet 16, and we’re celebrating Near Miss Day—the 34th anniversary of an asteroid a half-mile wide coming within 500,000 miles of Earth.

Hurtling through space at 46,000 miles per hour, it would have struck the planet with the force of 20 billion tons of TNT, probably canceling March Madness that year.

Like Ted Lasso and Succession, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have apparently entered their final season.

While the Fed increased interest rates <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30925906.100640/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80NFI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkyNTkwNi4xMDA2NDA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C19f85970> by another 25 basis points yesterday (its ninth straight rate increase), it also signaled that troubles in the banking sector could lead it to wrap up the rate hikes soonish.

The key words: In its statement after February’s meeting, the Fed said it expected to enact “ongoing increases” in rates to combat inflation. But yesterday, it swapped that language out for “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.” Yes, we’re getting into the fine print, but when it comes to Fed statements, small tweaks make a big difference. This change is a sign that rate hikes could be winding down.

The banking chaos is a big reason why

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that “serious difficulties at a small number of banks” have emerged, which is a reference to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its ripple effects across the sector.

While it sounds bizarre, the banking turmoil seems to have done some of the Fed’s work for it <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30925906.100640/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80NFM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkyNTkwNi4xMDA2NDA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C87e7f7e1>. Here’s how:

The Fed had been hiking interest rates to curb borrowing and, in turn, slow down the economy and inflation.

SVB’s implosion seems to have done precisely that. As banks hunker down during the storm, it’s “likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,” the Fed wrote.

All of that is not good for the economy, of course, but it could help lower price growth when inflation is still ripping at 6%.

Big picture: Powell has other things besides interest rates to worry about—specifically, job security. He’s been taking heat from lawmakers across the political spectrum over the blowup of several banks on his watch. Politicians as diametrically opposed as conservative Sen. Rick Scott and progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren have laid the blame for the banking failures at Powell’s feet, arguing that he failed to properly regulate banks in the lead-up to their collapse.

In response to criticism, Powell went full Bart Simpson on a chalkboard yesterday, saying that the Fed is “committed to learning the lessons from this episode, and to work to prevent episodes from events like this from happening again.”—NF

One nonprofit, United Network for Organ Sharing, has had a monopoly on running the system for nearly four decades, but the government’s proposal includes potentially bringing more organizations in, as well as upping funding and modernizing the computer systems involved. There are ~104,000 people currently waiting for an organ transplant, and 17 people die per day while waiting.

In prepared testimony released ahead of time, Chew maintained that a ban will hurt American businesses and that TikTok has “never shared, or received a request to share, US user data with the Chinese government.” Influencers have also been pleading TikTok’s case on Capitol Hill.

Thesaurus.com was probably the star of yesterdays Supreme Court oral arguments, in which attorneys for Jack Daniel’s had to use every synonym for “dog poop” they could find. The whiskey brand argued <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30925906.100640/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80NFo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkyNTkwNi4xMDA2NDA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C62fa2f21> that the dog toy company VIP Products violated its trademark with a crude squeaky toy that mimicked its iconic product.

The VIP “Bad Spaniels” dog toy at the center of the case is modeled after the recognizable whiskey bottle but, instead of saying “Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey,” it features “Old No. 2 on your Tennessee carpet” in an almost identical font. Jack Daniel’s claims that the toy’s similarity to the real product confuses customers and associates “fine whiskey with dog poop.” VIP says its toy is a parody protected as creative expression.

A district court sided with the whiskey-maker, but an appeals court said that, because the toy was a parody, extra care had to be taken to make sure that enforcing the trademark didn’t run afoul of the First Amendment. The appeals court then found VIP could keep making the toy.

Bottom line: Whether the high court sides with the toymaker or says the company really stepped in it, the decision could redefine how far federal trademark protections reach when humor is involved.—MM

NY’s governor and NYC’s mayor have clearly never heard the phrase “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” because, along with an alliance of businesses, they revealed a revamped version of the iconic “I NY” logo on Monday—and people hate it <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30925906.100640/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80NTI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkyNTkwNi4xMDA2NDA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb843474b>.

I NY is now “We NYC,” a direct riff on NY’s beloved original drawn by Milton Glaser on a scrap of paper in the back of a taxi in 1975. The simple slogan was dreamt up by an advertising firm to encourage tourism to a then-crime-ridden and nearly bankrupt NYC. Glaser gave his design to New York for free—and it now generates millions in merch sales every year.

The v2 is also part of an ad campaign, this time to “cut through divisiveness and negativity” stemming from the pandemic, the CEO of the Partnership for New York City said. The redesigned logo by Graham Clifford aims to “give it more of a modern twist” by sans-ing the serif, shading the heart, changing the “I” to “We,” and adding a C.

The new logo did bring New Yorkers together…in distaste:

Zoom out: Glaser updated his logo once, after 9/11, and while that one was popular, no remix is likely to stay popular as long as the original.—JW

And she does it all in custom Louboutin heels. But with Swift’s 44-song set list clocking in at about three hours, many fans are opting for sneakers and strategically planning out trips to the restroom. Some are trying to match Swift’s stamina, though: One told the WSJ, “If Taylor doesn’t need a bathroom break, neither do I.”

Good morning and Ramadan Mubarak to readers observing the Muslim holy month, which begins tonight for most communities. Interesting fact: Because Ramadan is linked to a lunar calendar, it begins 10–12 days earlier each year—so the next time it will start around this date won’t be until 2056. And the year 2030 will have two Ramadan observances, one beginning on Jan. 5 and the next on Dec. 25.

Dramatic Fed meeting: Chair Jerome Powell is in the hot seat today as he makes an interest-rate decision with global ramifications. The Fed will need to decide whether to continue raising interest rates to combat still-soaring inflation or hit the brakes to ease the pressure building on banks. Powell’s decision will influence how central bankers worldwide approach monetary policy in this dicey moment.

In the high-stakes race to release advanced AI tech, Google has been the tortoise to Microsoft’s hare. But even a tortoise takes a few steps forward now and again.

Yesterday, Google began rolling out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30913583.2937447/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80MUo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkxMzU4My4yOTM3NDQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca4f97ac6> its chatbot, Bard, to select US and UK users and plans to open it up to more people going forward (you can get on the waitlist here <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30913583.2937447/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80MUs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkxMzU4My4yOTM3NDQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3bf63891>).

Like its AI competitor ChatGPT, Bard can answer your questions in a humanlike, conversational tone. But Google, which has rolled out its AI tech more methodically than rival Microsoft, is stressing that Bard is still an “early experiment” and wants users to play around with it so the company can learn what needs to be fixed.

One thing users will definitely encounter is blatantly wrong information. So to cover its butt, Google has included a warning in the main text box: “Bard may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn’t represent Google’s views.” In fact, the entire Bard experience has more disclaimers than a white-water rafting trip, highlighting Google’s “use at your own risk” approach.

Big picture: Google is pitching Bard as a complement to its search business—not a replacement. As the dominant leader in search, Google must be careful with how it deploys AI: It can’t cannibalize search’s business model, but it also can’t allow the competition to disrupt search, either.

What else is happening in the world of AI?

Seems like every day in 2023, there’s a new AI development to delight or terrify you. Here’s a rundown of the latest…

Misinformation is a major concern.

🪧 LA schools shut down as support staff strike. The union representing the Los Angeles Unified School District’s 30,000 support workers began a three-day strike <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30913583.2937447/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80MVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkxMzU4My4yOTM3NDQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C90b7d2d6> yesterday, giving more than 500,000 K-12 students the LA equivalent of a snow day. The union is seeking a 30% pay bump for its members, whose average salary is $25,000 a year, and a $2/hour raise for the lowest-paid workers over the next four years. So far, the district has offered a 23% recurring raise and a 3% cash-in-hand bonus. The 35,000 teachers in the district—the country’s second-largest—also walked off the job in solidarity.

The median price for an existing home in February dropped 0.2% to $363,000, according to the National Association of Realtors, with the West and the Northeast experiencing the biggest price cuts. Home sales also surged 14.5% from January to February, snapping a yearlong decline and increasing the most since July 2020.

Her remarks come as a debate rages over whether all deposits, including those above the current $250k limit for FDIC insurance, should be protected from now on.

But it’s not quite the same—the popular hard seltzer brand is releasing a straight vodka, flavored vodkas, and canned vodka sodas.

The lake day drink’s parent company Mark Anthony Group, which is also the booze visionary behind Mike’s Hard Lemonade, is venturing into the vodka world to find growth outside of the oversaturated seltzer market. That means it’s about to take on one of the alcohol industry’s heaviest hitters. Tito’s Vodka, originally crafted in its founder’s backyard <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30913583.2937447/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy80MS0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDkxMzU4My4yOTM3NDQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f80b970>, unseated big-name rivals to become the best-selling vodka in the US in 2019 and it now accounts for 25% of vodka sales in retail stores.

Ironically, a change in a law helped extend the claw. In 2020, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau updated its definition of vodka, allowing the spirit to have a little bit of sugar and still be considered true vodka.

Big picture: With its new products, White Claw is entering two separate markets at very different stages of maturity. The vodka industry’s sales remained flat last year at $7.2 billion, while ready-to-drink cocktails were the fastest-growing spirit category in 2021, posting 35.8% revenue growth over 2020.—MM

In the lead-up to the election, the prestigious scientific journal accused former President Trump of neglecting science in his handling of Covid and climate change and threw its support behind Biden. But a study published this week concluded that the move could have undermined public trust in Nature and science more broadly.

The nuts and bolts: Stanford political economist Floyd Jiuyun Zhang surveyed 4,260 people (mostly supporters of Biden or Trump) in the summer of 2021 to better understand how scientists taking a partisan stance might affect their credibility with the public. Half of the participants were shown Nature’s statement endorsing Biden, while the other half was asked to read an announcement from the journal that had nothing to do with politics.

What we learned: Reading Nature’s endorsement of Biden was unlikely to turn someone into a supporter of him, but it did make some Trump fans skeptical of Nature and more distrustful of scientists in general.

Nature stood by its campaign advocacy. It claims the scientific community has an obligation to take a stand against politicians who “threaten a retreat from reason.”—SK

Good morning. This day could go down in history. Former President Donald Trump said that he expects to be arrested over an investigation into a hush-money payment today. And yesterday afternoon, the NYPD began installing steel barricades around Manhattan’s Criminal Court.

It’s still not a sure thing, but if Trump is indicted and arrested, he’d be the first former president to face criminal charges. His lawyers have said that if it happens, he’ll follow standard arrest procedures, including getting fingerprinted and having a mugshot taken. Should be an interesting day.

Biden checked-‘n’-balanced Congress yesterday with the first veto of his presidency. The president nixed a bill that would’ve overturned a Labor Department rule allowing retirement fund managers to consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their investment choices.

Why pick this fight?

ESG investments take social and social and environmental impacts: Investment choices are based on considerations like companies’ carbon emissions and executive pay, in addition to potential returns.

Opposing ESG investing has become as much of a cultural marker for Republicans as listening to All Things Considered is for Democrats. The anti-ESG bill was introduced by Republicans in the House.

GOP lawmakers want investment fund managers to focus exclusively on growing clients’ retirement savings by maximizing returns rather than advancing what they see as “woke” goals. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy accused Biden promoting ESG to “fund a far-left political agenda.”

Democrats say it’s important that fund managers have the option to focus on ESG. They argue that the dichotomy between social goals and investment returns is often false since the former can influence a company’s economic prospects over the long haul.

How did we get here?

During the Trump administration, the Labor Department moved to substantially limit ESG practices for 401(k) funds, but the Biden administration reversed course and made a rule to explicitly allow fund managers to incorporate ESG principles into their investment strategy. Republican lawmakers in both chambers supported the bill to reverse this policy, and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed it (aside from Senators Joe Manchin and Jon Tester and Rep. Jared Golden, who crossed party lines to vote “yea”).

Biden’s veto did not come as a surprise (he threatened to do it before the bill passed), but Republicans hope that passing the bill through Congress lays the foundation for a court battle that can get the rule thrown out.

Zoom out: So far, Biden has kept the presidential flexing to a minimum, compared to his predecessor’s 10 vetoes over four years and FDR’s record 372 vetoes in…12 years.—SK

Investors holding $17 billion worth of Credit Suisse’s additional tier-one bonds were shocked to discover that their $17 billion was now worth a grand total of…$0. The value of those bonds had been completely wiped out in the deal.

Quick background: Additional tier-one bonds, or AT1 bonds for short, were established after the 2008 financial crisis to reduce the likelihood that taxpayers would have to bail out a failed bank. AT1s are considered riskier assets, but with that risk comes higher potential returns.

So, if these bondholders knew they were taking on risk, why are they so upset? Mainly because, in this unusual deal, they got wiped out while shareholders didn’t. That’s not how the order of operations usually works:

When a write-down happens, shareholders traditionally suffer losses before bondholders get hit.

This deal flipped the food chain, and livid AT1 bondholders are now huddling up with lawyers about potential legal action.

Hundreds of scientists from around the world worked together to create the report. One finding the panel has “very high confidence” in? “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” Cue Lloyd Christmas saying, “So you’re telling me there’s a chance?”

Another weekend, another mad scramble to prevent a banking crisis.

Just one week after US officials raced to backstop Silicon Valley Bank depositors, Swiss authorities sprinted to engineer a takeover of spiraling Credit Suisse before the markets opened on Monday.

They got it done: Swiss banking giant UBS will buy its rival Credit Suisse <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0I_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca989a81c> for more than $3 billion in a historic tie-up of the country’s storied banks. It’s one of the most significant banking events in years, marking the first merger between systemically important global banks since the 2008 financial crisis.

How we got here: Credit Suisse had experienced massive outflows last week (up to $10 billion per day, according to the WSJ) and was teetering on collapse. An uncontrolled implosion of Credit Suisse would have had “incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system,” Swiss President Alain Berset said. In other words, if Credit Suisse came crashing down, it would have brought many others with it.

UBS didn’t exactly volunteer as tribute

Understanding the market calamity that would’ve occurred otherwise, Swiss regulators essentially forced UBS to go through with this purchase and offered the bank $108.8 billion in liquidity as a way of saying “thanks for preventing a global financial crisis .”

For Credit Suisse, it’s an inglorious end. The iconic financial institution had been badly mismanaged for years, and its measly sale price reflects its fall from grace. Valued at ~$8.5 billion at market close on Friday, Credit Suisse sold for significantly less than half of that.

To put the price tag in perspective, Crocs is worth more than twice as much as what Credit Suisse was bought for.

No disrespect to Crocs, but Credit Suisse has been around for 166 years and had $574 billion in total assets at the end of 2022. This is a stunning collapse of a once-revered bank.

So, what’s it all mean? Just like US authorities did last weekend, Swiss regulators moved rapidly to nip a spiraling crisis in the bud, employing a “let’s do what needs to be done and worry about the consequences later” approach. It’s unclear whether these last-ditch government efforts will shore up confidence in a sector that’s had its world turned upside down in less than two weeks.

Trump claims he’s going to be arrested. In a post on Truth Social, former President Donald Trump wrote (in all caps) that he expects to be arrested <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C084c809d> on Tuesday. His prediction was an apparent reference to the New York investigation into alleged hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, and all signs point to an indictment shortly. But Trump had no direct knowledge of the timing of an arrest, a spokesperson for the former president said. Trump ended his post by urging his supporters to protest and “take our nation back!” in an echo of his rhetoric ahead of the attack on the Capitol.

Could the insured deposit cap get a lift? At least four US lawmakers—two from each side of the aisle—said they would support raising the cap <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C65471945> on FDIC-insured deposits in order to reassure frazzled bank customers that their deposits are safe. The current cap is $250,000 (up from $100k pre-financial crisis), but Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said bumping it up “is a good move.” Opponents of raising the cap say it would only increase risk-taking and bad behavior by banks. Some even argue we should lower it <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfebf7698>.

Swift performed 44 songs from her deep catalog across 3 hours and 15 minutes, delighting fans who she acknowledged went through “considerable effort” to be there (likely a swipe at Ticketmaster).

An enormous seaweed blob heads for Florida <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D3b55bcc4> Beachgoers walk past seaweed that washed ashore on March 16, 2023 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E3b55bcc4> Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Seems like everyone is moving to Florida these days—including a gigantic blob of seaweed almost twice the width of the contiguous US.

The blob, comprised of 10 tons of sargassum algae, is trekking across the Caribbean toward Florida and is already washing up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0s_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce2f74d66> in places like Key West. Local communities across the Gulf of Mexico are worried the seaweed will force them to close popular tourism sites during the peak summer months.

That’s because when the seaweed piles up on a beach, it becomes a huge headache—literally.

Out of the water, sargassum rots and releases chemicals that smell like rotten eggs. Those chemicals also present a risk for people with respiratory issues.

And then there’s the sheer volume of seaweed. Sargassum is piling up five- to six feet deep <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30888583.2938895/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU0w_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg4ODU4My4yOTM4ODk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C25c08db1> on Caribbean beaches, and Barbados needs to employ 1,600 dump trucks a day to haul it away, Brian Lapointe, an oceanographer at Florida Atlantic University, told CNN.

Big picture: Sargassum blooms are not new, and they provide an important habitat for marine life as they move across the ocean. But, due to a variety of factors scientists haven’t fully grasped yet, the blobs have gotten much bigger since 2011. This year’s blob could break records.

The week ahead Jerome Powell Francis Scialabba
A high-stakes Fed meeting: While many Fed meetings are ho-hum, the one on Wednesday will pack the drama of a prime-time Oprah interview. The central bank’s plan to continue raising interest rates has been upended by the banking turmoil, and experts now say there’s a chance the Fed will pause its rate hikes to shield the banking sector from further chaos.

TikTok CEO on Capitol Hill. TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, where he’ll try to make the case that a sale won’t alleviate US lawmakers’ privacy concerns. The US has recently demanded Chinese-owned ByteDance sell its stake in TikTok or else it would ban the app.

Xi ​​Putin. Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow today for a three-day meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. China has tried to play it neutral around the war in Ukraine, but Xi’s visit to Russia symbolizes the close ties between the two US adversaries.

After using the cells to make eggs, they were able to fertilize them, implant them in females, and see some healthy babies be born and grow into fertile adults. The breakthrough raises the possibility of using the same techniques for human babies, but scientists cautioned that’s still a long way away.

Your morning brew may be good for you. Drinking three cups of coffee a day might make you type really fast and really loud, but a new study found it could also improve your health.

But before you zoom off to Latte Larry’s, know that the study had some limitations—it mostly involved people with European ancestry and didn’t actually test whether drinking caffeinated beverages causes the health benefits.

And when the founders of young companies catch their breath from the initial chaos, they’ll be confronted with a harsh reality: The days of easily securing bank loans while looking out over the Pride Lands are over.

The gist: The version of Silicon Valley Bank that now exists after regulators stepped in can give startups their money back, but not the services they’ve come to rely on.

SVB was rooted deep into the startup ecosystem

SVB was relatively small—it had 40,000 customers compared to JPMorgan Chase’s 66 million—but it claimed to bank nearly half of all US tech and life sciences startups last year, including household names like Etsy, Roblox, and Roku. The cultural cachet of having a relationship with SVB as a venture-backed startup was like sporting a New Yorker tote at Whole Foods.

But the reason its loss will leave such a gaping hole in the startup community isn’t that it was cool to name-drop at a networking event. Because the bank was created in 1983 specifically to cater to venture-backed startups, it helped them in ways that most banks can’t—or won’t.

SVB was known for super-chill loans: SVB would offer loans to startups more readily <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30873753.3348347/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUjc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3Mzc1My4zMzQ4MzQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6f2b5327> than large banks, basing the loans on a company’s ability to raise venture capital funds, not to turn a profit. SVB was also known for being flexible—even if startups breached their loan terms.

“They were the easiest money for an unprofitable, early stage to midstage tech company,” Irving Investors founder Jeremy Abelson told The Information.

Plus, it had a personalized touch: Even small startups received hand-holding services, such as guidance on how to set up their financial infrastructure. Its bankers personally called startups when they secured their first rounds of funding, according to The Information.

Now, startups might have to deal with big league banks

Several founders who previously banked with SVB told Bloomberg that they’re moving their money <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30873753.3348347/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUjg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3Mzc1My4zMzQ4MzQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc422b329> to Chase and Bank of America, banks considered “too big to fail.”

Startups’ experience at big banks won’t be like their time at SVB. Not only is Jamie Dimon unlikely to call a startup to congratulate them on their Series A, but big banks are also expected to be more tight-fisted with their loans. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a regulator that oversees large US banks, disapproves <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30873753.3348347/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUjk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3Mzc1My4zMzQ4MzQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C51087269> of loans to companies that are further out than one year from profitability, according to Crunchbase.

The loss of SVB is therefore expected to have a chilling effect on loans to venture-backed startups, aka “venture debt,” which SVB handed out more of than any other bank.

Zoom out: While on the surface, less money flowing to startups = bad, some think SVB’s collapse could be a net-positive reckoning for the startup community. Loans from SVB may have been too easy to procure, leading to reckless spending. “I think we all would be better off burning a lot less cash,” Chris Herndon, founder of SVB-banked startup The Guild, told The Information.—JW

  Place to be: the Washington, DC, Cherry Blossom Festival Cherry blossoms in D.C. Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

We’re nearing the end of March, and other than on your couch watching college basketball, the only other “place to be” is in Washington, DC, for the Cherry Blossom Festival <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30873753.3348347/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUm0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3Mzc1My4zMzQ4MzQ3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfa6925af>.

The festivities began yesterday, a few days earlier than intended. DC is coming off of a historically warm winter, and the blossoms will be their fluffiest selves (aka “peak bloom”) March 22–25.

How did DC get cherry blossoms?

We have Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore to thank. In 1885, the American travel writer returned from a visit to Japan, where she had become infatuated with the country’s flowering cherry trees, known as “Sakura.” For the next 24 years, she lobbied the US government to bring Japanese cherry trees to the nation’s capital. Ignored time and time again, she finally found a powerful ally in Dept. of Agriculture official David Fairchild, who was also an admirer of Japanese cherry trees.

The two convinced the first lady at the time, Helen Herron Taft, to join their crusade, and after a few more hiccups along the way, a donation of more 3,000 trees arrived in DC as a gesture of goodwill from the mayor of Tokyo.

You can see the blossoming of Scidmore’s dream along the Tidal Basin over the next five weekends.—NF

Little discs of cardboardy dough smothered with unnervingly sweet pizza sauce via a tiny red stick, sprinkled with what is called “cheese”: Lunchables’s Extra Cheesy Pizza—as well as its Turkey and Cheese variety—will be on the menu at K-8 cafeterias across the US come fall as part of Kraft-Heinz’s new deal <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30877082.2947019/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUlc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3NzA4Mi4yOTQ3MDE5/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7219392d> with the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), a program that provides free or low-cost lunches to nearly 30 million children.

’90s kids may already be salivating, but they should know that Kraft-Heinz had to tweak its original recipes to hit some nutritional targets required for school meals—such as lower levels of fat and sodium and increased amounts of protein and whole grains.

Child nutrition experts aren’t satisfied with the new formulations

They argue that the reengineered Lunchables are a red flag that the US’s standards for school lunches are simply too low…and that they may be that way in part because schools are too underfunded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30877082.2947019/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zUlg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3NzA4Mi4yOTQ3MDE5/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C76d07888> to raise them.

K-12 cafeterias’ budgets are being tightened by high food costs, supply chain snags, and labor shortages.

One of Lunchables’ main selling points to the NSLP was that it’s refrigerated, not frozen, which costs less to ship and store.

“School nutrition programs need to be reimbursed at a rate that they can scratch-cook delicious, healthy meals and not just provide the students a Lunchable because they don’t have equipment or labor,” Donna Martin, the director of a school nutrition program, told the Washington Post.

Others are concerned that selling a healthier version in schools than in stores could confuse customers into thinking the for-school versions and the grocery originals are equally healthy.

But you’re unlikely to see a Putin perp walk any time soon—the ICC can only arrest and try Putin if Russia hands him over (it won’t) or if it can nab him outside the country. Russia has long denied committing war crimes and does not recognize the court’s authority.

Raccoon dogs, an animal known to have been sold at the market, aren’t raccoons, and while they’re part of the dog family, they’re most closely related to foxes.

And it has Silicon Valley Bank and friends to thank for it.

Why is crypto getting a boost? Crypto diehards claim bitcoin's gains are the result of people losing faith in traditional banking after the unholy trinity of SVB, Signature, and Silvergate  imploded in the last week.

Looking ahead…The Fed’s decision next week will likely serve as crypto’s Groundhog Day. And despite the banking industry hoping Jerome Powell pauses the interest rate hikes, February’s inflation numbers showed that the Fed needs to stick to its original plan to keep inflation in check.—MM

Some wicked news for Massholes: Bay Staters’ right to be as insolent at town assemblies as they are behind the wheel was upheld <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30877082.2947019/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zU2E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg3NzA4Mi4yOTQ3MDE5/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C44ae8e3f> by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The state’s high court unanimously ruled that towns cannot require residents to act civilly in public meetings.

Politeness vs. freedom of assembly

The main plaintiff in the case was 71-year-old Louise Barron, of Southborough, MA. Barron sued after her brash behavior got her threatened with removal from a town meeting under rules requiring civility. She was uncivil: In a heated argument, Barron accused the town’s Select Board of spending taxpayer funds “like drunken sailors” and told one member “to stop being a Hitler.”

The court opined that local governments should encourage polite discourse but deemed Southborough’s public meeting civility rules a violation of citizens’ contitutional right to criticize public servants.

Mixed opinions: While some critics worry it’ll embolden cantankerous constituents, freedom of speech advocates welcomed the decision. Bellicose exchanges in town meetings are as much a Massachusetts tradition as sipping on a Dunks medium iced while plowing snow after a mighty nor’easter.

Zoom out: Discussions in public meetings have reportedly become more combative nationwide, as passions ran high over Covid policies and other contentious issues.—SK

Emily may have to keep posting about luxury products in her fancy Paris office for longer than she anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and his supporters used executive power to bypass Parliament and raise <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30864054.101657/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zTzU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg2NDA1NC4xMDE2NTc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7766f54b> France’s official retirement age from 62 to 64 yesterday, despite massive pushback from much of the country.

Macron, who’s 10 months into his second five-year term, campaigned on the promise of raising the official retirement age to help keep France’s shrinking pension fund flush with cash. He and his supporters have noted that French people are living on average three years longer compared to a few decades ago, and the retirement age needs to reflect that.

This is about as popular as your sister’s new boyfriend

About three-quarters of the French public is against raising the retirement age. Over the last few months, trade unions have launched eight coordinated protests across the country, and millions of citizens have marched in the streets, stymying public services.

Workers’ strikes have disrupted transportation services, including trains and planes.

More than 7,000 tons of garbage have piled up in Paris after sanitation workers walked off the job in protest.

What comes next? French lawmakers who oppose the change are preparing a no-confidence vote that if successful would essentially gut Macron’s ability to do anything going forward and reverse the retirement age bump. The likelihood of that passing? Not high. So far during Macron’s tenure, several previous no-confidence votes have failed. But unions have vowed to continue protests and “take things up a gear <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30864054.101657/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zTzY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg2NDA1NC4xMDE2NTc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb4651530>” following Macron’s move.

Big picture: France isn’t the only country that wants to make citizens send emails for more of their lives. The UK and China have both floated the idea of raising retirement ages as their elderly populations eclipse working-age citizens. In the US, the idea of bumping the retirement age has also been proposed as a fix for Social Security reserves expected to run dry in 2034.—MM

A proposal to kill farmed octopuses with extremely cold water has landed a Spanish company in hot water with animal welfare advocates. Seafood producer Nueva Pescanova aims to open an octopus farm <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30864054.101657/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zT2c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg2NDA1NC4xMDE2NTc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5fd3a52> in the Canary Islands, the world’s first, where it reportedly would slaughter the mollusks for food by placing them in -3 degree Celsius slush, according to leaked documents obtained by Eurogroup for Animals.

Scientists point to studies on fish to argue that the slaughter method would distress the highly intelligent animals and cause them to die slowly. Animal rights supporters note that the plan to house the octopuses in lit-up communal tanks doesn’t adequately replicate their natural habitat—the animals are territorial and thrive in darkness.

Nueva Pescanova rejects accusations of animal cruelty.

Why are humans rallying around octopuses?

Though wild-caught octopuses are a delicacy in global coastal cuisines (and one award-winning thriller <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30864054.101657/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zT2g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg2NDA1NC4xMDE2NTc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5fbb14fa>), their cognitive prowess makes them a more ethically contentious culinary delight than most other seafood.

One Dartmouth University cognitive neuroscientist believes they’re “as intelligent as cats,” and UK law recently recognized them as sentient beings since they can feel pain and pleasure.

What’d Ticketmaster do this time? When The Cure announced its latest tour, the band promised to keep ticket prices affordable.

Angry Cureheads vented about the extra charges on social media. One fan tweeted a screenshot showing they bought four tickets for $80—but the fees amounted to another $92.10.

The Cure’s frontman, Robert Smith, sympathized with his fans. He tweeted, “I AM AS SICKENED AS YOU ALL ARE BY TODAY’S TICKETMASTER ‘FEES’ DEBACLE” and lamented that artists have no way to counter Ticketmaster. He also noted that the band had used Ticketmaster to try to avoid scalping while opting out of the company’s dynamic pricing model and Platinum ticket tier because they’re “a bit of a scam.”

Big picture: Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation have already been catching heat from US lawmakers over their market dominance in live events after botching the rollout of tickets for Swift’s Eras Tour. This latest controversy could add fuel to that fire.—AR

Just when we thought we could put up our feet and enjoy a stress-free day of watching college basketball, another banking mess emerged.

Yesterday’s mayhem stems not from California, but from Zurich. The Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse cratered <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30848879.2966880/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zSnM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg0ODg3OS4yOTY2ODgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C667c22a8> to a record low yesterday after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, said it couldn’t provide Credit Suisse with any more financial support due to regulations. Investors already rattled by two major bank failures in the US sent bank stocks tumbling, and concerns grew that the fragile financial sector could fracture.

To shore up liquidity, Credit Suisse said last night it will borrow <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30848879.2966880/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zSzY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg0ODg3OS4yOTY2ODgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cda621474> up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank.

Are Credit Suisse’s problems related to SVB?

No. Credit Suisse has been in the Bad Place for years due to mismanagement and scandals. When many clients yanked their money out of the bank last year, Credit Suisse posted its biggest annual loss since the financial crisis.

And, unlike SVB, which catered to a niche client base of startups, 167-year-old Credit Suisse is a much more influential player <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30848879.2966880/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zSnU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg0ODg3OS4yOTY2ODgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca835c25d> with deep ties to financial markets all over the globe. It is considered a “systemically important financial institution” under international banking regulations.

But if you’re a bank, now’s not a time to show any weakness

Though SVB’s implosion did not lead to Credit Suisse’s current crisis, it did expose how banks everywhere are under pressure from rising interest rates. When rates were near zero, banks scooped up safe but low- or even negative-yielding bonds. Now that rates are much higher, the value of those bonds fell, and banks are sitting on loads of unrealized losses.

In other words, SVB’s collapse woke up the mama bear, then Credit Suisse went and poked it.

Zoom out: Some finance leaders think a “slow rolling crisis” is coming for banks. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in his widely read annual letter, wrote that rapid rate increases have “exposed cracks in the financial system,” and he predicted “more seizures and shutdowns coming.”—NF

He was reportedly one of the richest people in China before he fled the country and potential prosecution, settled in New York, and became pals with Donald Trump’s former political strategist Steve Bannon.

Ryan Reynolds just proved he’s an entrepreneur first, Blake Lively’s arm candy second. T-Mobile announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30848879.2966880/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zSkc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDg0ODg3OS4yOTY2ODgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf3f00b54> yesterday it is buying Mint Mobile, the mobile carrier partially owned by the actor, for nearly $1.35 billion.

How do you go from Deadpool to owning a wireless provider? In 2019, Reynolds bought a stake in Mint Mobile, which sells budget phone plans for as little as $15 a month. He starred in a series of fun ads for the company—understanding, like any adult trying to monetize the skills they learned from the arts™, that marketing was his best way into the business world.

And marketing agreed with him: He is currently the chief creative officer of an ad tech company that’s made campaigns for projects he’s involved in as well as companies he’s not connected to, like Peloton and Match Group.

This isn’t the only successful sale of a Reynolds-backed business: In 2018 he became a co-owner of Aviation Gin, which he sold to Diageo in 2020 for a reported ~$610 million.

Big picture: Having acquired MetroPCS in 2013 and merged with Sprint in 2020 (the latter despite major pushback from regulators), T-Mobile is betting on Reynolds, who will stay on in a creative role, and his continued charismatic ad strategy will help T-Mobile’s now small army of budget carriers snag more customers.—MM

No one should be more worried about getting replaced in their job by OpenAI’s GPT-4 than GPT-3.5. It’s been just two days since OpenAI launched the next generation of its famed AI engine, but users are already making the most of its talents.

What can GPT-4 do?

Similar to ChatGPT-3.5, the updated system can write humanlike text and code. But it’s also capable of analyzing images—and OpenAI says this version is more creative. Here’s what we’ve seen it do so far:

It turned a hand-drawn sketch on a napkin into a functional website.

One user had it generate recipes based on a photo of some groceries.

Another said they got it to recreate code for the arcade game Pong in less than a minute.

Several companies have already “hired” the chatbot

GPT-4 will help Duolingo language learners practice their conversation skills.

Payment giant Stripe has it advising developers on technical matters.

Khan Academy was clearly impressed by GPT-4’s potential to get the top score on some AP exams: The education nonprofit is launching a pilot to have the chatbot tutor students and help teachers plan lessons.

Yes, but…despite the updates, GPT-4 is still prone to churning out BS in cases where a reasonable human would respond with a simple “I’m not sure.”—SK

So, what breed scooted in on stubby legs with an adorable smushed-in face to take the top dog spot? The French Bulldog. About one out of every seven dogs registered with the AKC last year was a Frenchie, reflecting a rapid rise in popularity of the breed—which, though guaranteed to pull in likes on social media, can also suffer from serious health problems.

We’re beginning to learn what Meta’s “year of efficiency” means in practice: fewer employees.

Yesterday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta plans to lay off 10,000 employees, <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1089e959> just four months after it laid off 11,000 staff members. That round of layoffs, impacting 13% of Meta’s workforce, represented the biggest job cuts in the company’s history.

Not only is Meta laying off 10k employees, but it’s also closing 5,000 open roles. This is not a company that wants to onboard many people right now.

Why is that?

Meta is looking to reduce costs as part of what Mark Zuckerberg calls the “year of efficiency.” Last year was “a humbling wake-up call,” Zuck said, citing economic uncertainty and increased competition (aka TikTok) for denting the company’s ad revenue.

But Meta made plenty of unforced errors, too. And by dubbing 2023 “the year of efficiency,” it’s acknowledging that previously, things were not very efficient.

That starts with hiring. Meta has been criticized for growing its headcount so rapidly that many employees had nothing to do.

In a viral TikTok video <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR2s_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceb5f87dc>, one former Meta employee said, “we were just sitting there” and “you had to fight to find work.”

A report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR2w_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3e81cee5> in Wired argues that Meta’s headcount got bloated due to “ghosts in the machine”—employees who were brought on to launch new products and stayed on the payroll even when those products failed.

Putting the recent layoffs in context: Even after shedding 21,000 jobs, Meta will still have a higher headcount than it did before the pandemic. In the boom times of 2020 and 2021, it hired <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR20_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C36da6fa6> more than 27,000 employees.

Zoom out: While the US labor market remains strong, layoffs have spiked in 2023. Companies announced 180,713 job cuts <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR24_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C447f6b54> in January and February—the most to start any year since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. About one-third of the layoffs took place at tech companies.—NF

We’ve written at George R. R. Martin-length about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the second-largest banking collapse in US history. But did you know that the third-biggest bank failure <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zSGU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8f41aa90> happened just two days after SVB imploded? The deets are juicy.

On Sunday, regulators seized the assets of NY-based Signature Bank and gave senior management the boot, but they assured its depositors that they could access all of their money. Signature was deemed a threat to the US financial system after panicked customers reportedly withdrew 20% of its total deposits.

But leaders inside the bank say authorities overreacted, led by none other than Barney Frank, the former US representative on Signature’s board. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Frank crafted key banking regulations in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis (the Dodd-Frank Act).

Frank argues that Singature was singled out because of its ties to crypto—it was one of the go-to banks for crypto companies. Frank told Bloomberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30836836.2966161/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zR3U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgzNjgzNi4yOTY2MTYx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce481dcf9> that he believes Signature wasn’t on the verge of collapse, and regulators only shut it down “to send a message to get people away from crypto.”

Authorities have pushed back on the pushback. The New York State Department of Financial Services, which initiated the closure, claims that Signature executives were elusive in sharing data with regulators during the bank panic, causing a “crisis of confidence.”—SK

The lawsuit, filed last Friday, states that Halim believed BWW’s boneless chicken wings were actually deboned wings. If he had known the breast-meat truth, Halim claims he would have ordered something else, and therefore he’s suffered “financial injury.”

This debate has been a hot one.

But we’ve been having the conversation even before that. In the early 2000s, boneless wings gained popularity when the price of chicken breast—which is what boneless wings are usually made of—cratered, while wings remained expensive. And wing purists have always pushed back against the bone-free option. The prices of both items have fluctuated in the past few years, but the debate over what, if anything, constitutes a boneless wing has raged on.—MM

Good morning. At an event outside Tokyo in 2006, Akira Haraguchi set an unofficial world record for reciting the most digits of pi: 100,000+ over more than 16 hours. So, how’d he do it? In his mind, he linked each digit with a syllable and created a collection of epic stories from the words those syllables formed.

For Haraguchi, pi is more than just a number—it’s a spiritual calling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30823808.2976653/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zQnc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgyMzgwOC4yOTc2NjUz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2f8820d5>. He told The Guardian: “All things in this world, including ourselves, are aggregate sums of atoms, which are made up of rotating electrons. The ultimate history of mankind is moving toward a happy ending for people of all races. The Earth, the galaxy, and the universe all rotate. In other words, I think rotation is the absolute truth. So as long as I’m thinking about pi, I think I can live a life according to truth.”

Happy Pi Day.

Some stocks were actually buoyed by the notion that the Fed might stop raising interest rates due to the potential for a banking crisis. But bank stocks, especially regional ones, took a big hit, even though several regional banks told news outlets that they weren’t experiencing the big deposit pullouts investors feared.

You may have heard that the second- and third-largest bank implosions in US history occurred in the past four days. And since financial regulators know that bank runs can be as contagious as measles, they moved fast to keep cash flowing in order to prevent a system-wide epidemic.

Officials announced Sunday that clients of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank will get their full deposits back, with the money coming from the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The decision prompted comparisons to when Uncle Sam bailed out banking behemoths back in 2008, angering many taxpayers who footed the bill to rescue bank shareholders and executives.

But is it a bailout?

Here’s why it sure looks like a bailout to some: The FDIC guarantees bank deposits only up to $250,000, but most SVB and Signature clients were businesses rather than individuals, with account balances surpassing that mark. The government threw out the $250k compensation limit for the banks’ clients. And the Federal Reserve said it’s got cash ready to loan other banks that might be in trouble.

But officials are adamant that there’s no need to use the b-word <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30823808.2976653/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zQzc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgyMzgwOC4yOTc2NjUz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca6f82ae9>, pointing out that only the banks’ clients are getting their money back.

So, what’s different this time around?

Unlike in 2008, SVB and Signature investors are taking a loss, and executives at the banks will be fired. “That’s how capitalism works,” President Biden said, referring to the fact that shareholders won’t get a free pass for their financial flops (sorry if you took Jim Cramer’s advice <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30823808.2976653/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zQkE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgyMzgwOC4yOTc2NjUz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cac7a8618>).

The Treasury Department is also stressing that this time the recovery money is not from taxpayers but from an FDIC fund that banks pay into.

However, there’s no free lunch for taxpayers…banks may have to shell out extra cash to the FDIC to make SVB and Signature clients whole, which could ultimately come out of their customers’ pockets.—SK

But the fact that we’re even talking about the Fed potentially pausing rate hikes shows how dramatically the conversation has shifted since last Friday, when the probability of a meaty, 50 basis-point hike was 40% (now it’s 0%).

Zoom out: The Fed already had a tough job trying to bring down historic inflation. But thanks to SVB’s implosion, it now needs to balance its fight against inflation with preventing even more banking chaos.

Looking ahead…the Fed’s path forward could get even murkier when the latest inflation report drops this morning.—NF

President Biden approved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30823808.2976653/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zQk4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgyMzgwOC4yOTc2NjUz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C73a1b06a> the controversial Willow oil project for the Alaskan Arctic yesterday. That means oil company ConocoPhillips can drill on some of the US’s last unspoiled wilderness, where it’ll extract an estimated 576 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.

Environmentalists oppose the drilling, calling the approval a severe setback for Biden’s goal of cutting CO2 emissions in half by 2030. And they’ve got support: More than 1 million protest letters have been sent to the White House, a Change.org petition has 3.2 million signatures, and the #StopWillow hashtag on TikTok has over 180 million views.

But Alaska lawmakers, oil industry groups, and some Native groups welcome <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30823808.2976653/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zQk8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgyMzgwOC4yOTc2NjUz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd5d53942> the Willow oil project for the revenue and jobs it could create.

Biden *tried* to please everyone

The final project scales back ConocoPhillips’s original proposal by about 68,000 acres, only allowing three out of five requested drilling “pads,” or sites where a rig is set up.

Biden also threw in some environmental consolation gifts: He banned all drilling in the Arctic Ocean and added protections for 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. But Jamal Raad, co-founder of the climate group Evergreen Action, called these measures “lipstick on a pig.”

Looking ahead…environmental groups plan to oppose the project in court.—JW

Good morning. That was a wild weekend for news, and to think—it all happened with one fewer hour.

Somehow we’ve managed to squeeze it into one newsletter: the scramble to prevent a banking crisis, an Oscars recap, turmoil at the BBC, and a lot more. You might want to grab your coffee before diving in.

Markets: Investors probably feel like a 5,000-pound weight has been lifted off their shoulders since US regulators announced a plan to make Silicon Valley Bank depositors whole. But danger still lurks: An important inflation report is on tap this week, and the banking sector remains skittish following SVB’s shocking collapse. After another weekly loss last week, the S&P is now barely in the green for the year.

 

BANKING

OK, you can breathe now <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeHM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Db4a96105> Silicon Valley Bank branch <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeHM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Eb4a96105> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
At the end of an extremely stressful weekend, depositors of collapsed Silicon Valley Bank were told they could have everything everywhere, at all once.

Yesterday evening, the US government informed anxious SVB depositors that they’d have access <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeHQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C423fedd9> to all the money they stashed with the lender today, even if the amount exceeded the $250,000 limit insured by the FDIC. In addition to backstopping depositors, the Fed is offering additional funding to some banks to limit the contagion from spreading across the banking sector.

The Fed’s aggressive actions, the scale of which we haven’t seen since early Covid, show how the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday could have quickly turned into a full-blown banking crisis when markets opened this morning.

Banking is a confidence game, and if people and businesses felt their uninsured deposits were at risk, they could start pulling money from other banks in a catastrophic bank run.

The government had a hard deadline of 9:30am ET this morning to restore confidence in the banking system, and it beat it. Heck, it even got it done before the Oscars.

However, in their announcement, regulators also noted the closure of a second bank, New York-based Signature Bank, over “systemic risk.” All of Signature’s depositors will be made whole, they said.

What it all means

The government’s propping up of SVB’s depositors means the US startup ecosystem will avoid an “extinction-level event <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeHU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C59b1f0a2>,” as some startup leaders had warned. More than half of US tech and life sciences startups banked with SVB, and many were concerned they wouldn’t have enough money to pay employees this week or keep their companies running.

What will happen to SVB? Its assets will be sold to the highest bidder. The FDIC, which now controls SVB, began an auction for the bank’s assets Saturday night. The cleanest outcome would be a single buyer, but there are only a few banks big enough to realistically scoop it all up, such as JPMorgan, Citigroup, or Bank of America. As of last night, no deal had been reached.

Bottom line: While it appears that we won’t be reliving 2008, expect SVB to remain in the headlines for days and weeks to come. Politically charged debates over the Fed’s decision to backstop depositors, the meaning(lessness) of FDIC insurance, regulation of mid-sized banks, and how to prevent another SVB-like collapse have already begun and will only grow louder.

It was also the first time that two Asian actors—Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh—won Oscars in the same year, both for their roles in EEAAO. Brendan Fraser took home best actor for portraying a 600-pound professor in The Whale. Overall, it was a huge night for A24, the studio behind all six winners of the top Oscar categories.

More Oscars: In addition to the awards, viewers were treated to performances by Rihanna and an oddly close-up performance by Lady Gaga. However, those two megastars were ultimately upstaged by “Naatu Naatu <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeHo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C59023c69>” from RRR, which became the first song from an Indian film to win best original song. By the time the show concluded (way too late), the newly formed Oscars crisis team had not been called into action, since no shenanigans like last year’s slap occurred during the broadcast.

A scandal has erupted in Britain at the intersection of TV, sports, and politics.

This weekend, the BBC was forced to pull <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeEM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4813464a> much of its sports coverage following a boycott by anchors and commentators in solidarity with Gary Lineker.

Lineker, a former star soccer player and now a hugely popular TV presenter, was suspended <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30813774.3386742/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeEQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgxMzc3NC4zMzg2NzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cceaaae03> by the BBC on Friday for a tweet that criticized the UK government’s immigration proposal to stop asylum-seekers from coming into the country via boats.

The BBC said that Lineker’s tweet violated its impartiality guidelines and suspended him from his hosting duties at Match of the Day, a beloved soccer program that’s been around since the ’60s (imagine the glory days of NFL PrimeTime, but with 100x the cultural cache).

Chaos ensued. To support Lineker, other BBC on-air talent didn’t show up for work this weekend, causing the network to scramble to fill in programming. It even aired a prerecorded podcast on the radio instead of live soccer coverage.

The political fallout: Lineker’s suspension sparked a debate over the BBC’s independence from the government, with critics accusing it of caving to pressure from conservative lawmakers. Even Prime Minister Rishi Sunak weighed in, defending the government’s immigration proposal and expressing hope that Lineker and the BBC would work things out.

Critics were quick to label these SOS calls to the government hypocritical, reminding everyone of investors’ traditionally libertarian, get-the-government-out-of-my-business views. One thing we know for sure: The reactions to SVB’s collapse only deepened the animosity between tech investors and the media.

  Dept. of Progress Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better but maybe also kill your buzz.

Sobering science. Researchers at UT Southwestern may have found a way to sober you up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdXU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf6afda74> fast. At the very least, they’ve figured out what to do with mice that might be slugging IPAs while living in your walls. They found that injecting the liver-produced hormone FGF21 into mice that were passed out from booze brought the critters back to consciousness in half the time it otherwise takes to sleep it off. If it works for humans, the research could lead to lifesaving treatments for alcohol poisoning.

Super superconductor news. Scientists reported a breakthrough in the journal Nature that could improve any technology that uses electric power, from car batteries to maglev trains to fusion reactors. The researchers claim to have discovered a superconducting material <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdXY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C19bb07d7> that, unlike the ones we’ve got now, can work at around room temperature and low enough pressure levels to be commercially viable. One caveat: The team behind the new superconductor had a similar paper retracted by the same journal in 2020, leaving some experts skeptical of their work this time around.

What causes coulrophobia? That SAT word means fear of clowns, and scientists recently set out to determine why we’re all so freaked out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdXc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C772ff737> by Bozos: Unsurprisingly, it’s the way they look. Though negative pop culture portrayals play a role, the researchers concluded that most people get spooked around clowns because we’re uncomfortable that we can’t suss out their true facial expressions behind their makeup. Of the 53.5% of people surveyed who admitted to being afraid of the circus workers, very few reported having actually had a close encounter with a Pennywise type.—AR

With little hard evidence to draw from, some experts believe that the virus leaked from a lab, specifically the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), while others maintain it transferred from animals to humans. US government agencies are divided, and a congressional subcommittee has embarked on a quest this week to get closer to the truth by holding the first hearing on Covid’s origins. But many experts aren’t waiting for a definitive verdict on the lab leak theory <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdXk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1ad912e1> to jump into a heated discussion about whether the current safety regulations around the globe for research involving high-risk viruses are sufficient.

Even the idea that a virus that killed almost 7 million people may have started from a sleep-deprived intern had us wondering just how many other labs like WIV are out there and what they’re up to—so let’s dive in. 

What kind of labs are these?

Labs like WIV are designated Biosafety Level 4 by the CDC, which means they work with dangerous and highly transmissible diseases for which there are no vaccines or treatments. A pair of gloves and a lab coat won’t cut it at Level 4 facilities: They’re usually housed in buildings with controlled airflow and state-of-the-art equipment, where staff are often swagged out in PPE on steroids <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdXo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3c162d19>.

The number of Level 4 labs has grown in recent years.

* There are 52 of them operating around the world, including four in the US. And 17 more are due to open in the future.

* Locations range from Boston, MA, to Minsk, Belarus. A group of researchers conveniently created a map <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdUE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfb9b8b41> so you can find the one nearest to you.

Though most Level 4 labs are operated by governments, some are privately run. The international standards meant to govern safety are difficult to enforce, and many experts argue that the regulations that are in place are too lax—even in the US.

So, what’s up with US labs?

Every member of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity agrees that there needs to be a serious overhaul of how the US government handles oversight of dangerous pathogens. The board recommended that officials direct more scrutiny at research funded with private money and lower the threshold for what is considered a high-risk pathogen.

Biosecurity experts Gregory D. Koblentz and Rocco Casagrande say <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdUI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9cda4b5e> that the US “has taken a reactive and haphazard approach to preventing lab accidents.” They think there should be an independent government agency to regulate the research.

Meanwhile, former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has called for an outright ban on research that involves engineering viruses to make them stronger. An early proponent of the lab leak hypothesis, Redfield says such research is too risky to be worth it. But infectious disease expert Dr. Paul Auwaerter disagrees: He warns that halting the research in the US won’t stop it from happening elsewhere.

Viruses don’t recognize borders…which is why many experts are calling for international cooperation in crafting research standards that will hopefully prevent the next pandemic, or at least preclude the need to argue about where it came from.—SK

Because Japan’s population is shrinking fast, and an advisor to the prime minister recently warned <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdVA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5a7b2e7> that “the country will disappear” if Japan doesn’t turn things around in the stork-delivery department. About 2x as many people died as were born in Japan last year.

But Nagi is an exception to the rule <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30798758.3368811/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zdU8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc5ODc1OC4zMzY4ODEx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E7c2e8982>, the WSJ reported. Women on average there have more than two children, compared to the national average of closer to one. Experts credit the town’s financial support for childcare as a factor encouraging more births— daycare costs a maximum of $420/month for a parent’s first child and the cost goes down to $0 for the third.

Previously, Nagi was only known for inspiring a village of ninjas in the manga series Naruto. But now, thanks to its fecundity (big word alert), it’s become somewhat of a travel destination—“baby tourism,” we’ll call it. Delegations from other parts of Japan and even South Korea have been visiting to understand its baby-making sauce.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work Last week we asked you: What lore in your town should be turned into a Hollywood movie?

Here are some of our favorite responses:

* “In Salt Lake City, there is a grave for Lilly E. Gray, which prominently reads: ‘Victim of the Beast 666.’ Quite mysterious and great horror movie fodder.”—Kate from Utah

* “My hometown of Cut and Shoot, TX, supposedly got its name because in the early 1900s a preacher with a radical doctrine wanted to use the new town hall to preach a sermon. Half the town was vehemently against this. So those in favor nearly fought a battle against the pro faction. After that, it was known as where all the cutting and shooting [almost] happened.”—Jason from Cut and Shoot, Texas

* “The mall in Fredericksburg, VA, had a wig shop that stayed there for 30 years. The storefront never changed and the inventory was never updated, but somehow it survived. The wig store was the one constant among an ever-rotating cast of Chess Kings and Spencer’s. Was it the little engine that could, or a mob front? I need a movie about this place!”—Tom from Fredericksburg, Virginia

This week’s question

As we mentioned earlier, Boy Meets World star Ben Savage is running for a US House seat in California. He’s not running as Cory Matthews…but he might be more successful if he were.

So, we’re wondering: If you could elect any fictional character as US president, who would it be?

Here’s Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: Dalton, Patrick Swayze’s character in Road House. If he can turn the Double Deuce around, he can turn anything around.

Good morning. Unfortunately, today’s Saturday Sketch will be the last. Our full-time writer/part-time illustrator Max Knoblauch is moving on to a new opportunity, and none of us can quite can draw “Godzilla working from home” like he can (you’ll see).

We’ll miss Max’s deadpan humor, TikTok cameos, and cartoon animals, but we wish him the best of luck on his next adventure. And remember: This isn’t goodbye, it’s…um, well yeah, suppose it is goodbye.

Silicon Valley Bank is no more. The tech industry’s go-to lender imploded in the second largest bank failure in US history. After investor concerns about Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) solvency prompted a bank run, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of customers’ deposits yesterday.

The collapse happened fast:

SVB said Wednesday that it sold some of its assets at an almost $2 billion loss, sending investors and depositors into full freak out mode.

Its stock tanked over 60% the next day and several prominent VC funds advised their portfolio companies to pull their deposits.

By Friday, the 40-year-old bank was toast.

Why did things go south?

SVB counted nearly half of all venture-backed US companies among its customers. That client list was a blessing when interest rates were low so startups were swimming in cash from VCs. Its deposits more than tripled between 2018 and 2021.

But when interest rates began to climb last year, deposits shrank and so did the value of the bonds it bought with depositors’ cash. Short sellers have been sounding alarm bells about risks to smaller banks for some time now. But SVB was particularly vulnerable as it parked an unusually high share of customers’ funds in bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

What this means for SVB depositors

So when, if ever, will all those startups see their $175 billion in deposits? Each customer is guaranteed to receive up to $250,000 per account from the FDIC, but they’ll have to wait for the sale of SVB’s remaining assets to see if they can get any more money back (and most will have to make payroll before then).

Some are getting creative: The toy store Camp is offering a 40% discount with promo code “bankrun” to help it stay afloat as it waits for its cash to be returned.

Zoom out: SVB’s downfall sent shockwaves through the banking sector. But banks’ finances are in better shape now than they were in 2008, leaving experts optimistic that a full system meltdown is not on the horizon.—SK

It was more than expected, signaling a strong labor market despite months of interest rate hikes aimed at slowing growth to tame inflation.

Long gone are the days of puking rainbow filters. A TikTok filter called “Bold Glamour”—which contours users’ cheekbones, plumps their lips, and gives them Cara Delevingne brows—has been used in 18.5 million videos, most of which were posted in the last week.

The filter is being lauded for how convincing it looks…but also bashed for how morphing people’s facial features could impact their self-esteem.

How it works: Many speculate the filter uses new AI capabilities that TikTok rolled out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30802367.2974113/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zeGU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDgwMjM2Ny4yOTc0MTEz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C851efd47> last month (but TikTok hasn’t confirmed). While old-school filters map your 2D face onto a 3D model, resulting in glitches when you try to dab or whatever, the new generation of AI filters is built to stay flush with your skin. Videos featuring “Bold Glamour” show users rubbing their hands across their faces in shock and awe.

Good morning. Today has been dubbed Mario Day, and you wanna know why? Because it’s March 10, and if squish that to Mar10, it looks a lot like “Mario.”

Mario Day had us thinking of other “holidays” that could be established based on combining months + numbers that resemble letters. A couple ideas:

Jan15—a celebration of Janis Joplin.

Nov31—make that 3 into an “e” and you’ve got yourself Novel Day.

If you’re bored today, try out some combinations and let us know what new holidays you’ve created.

President Biden laid out his ideal 2024 budget plan yesterday. Maybe we should say ideal-istic, because it’s the White House’s version of asking that no one gift wine at a white elephant. While the proposals are unlikely to be approved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30788859.3375890/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zc0M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc4ODg1OS4zMzc1ODkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C03cfc2b8> by the split Congress, they give a sneak peek of Biden’s policy priorities heading into the next election cycle.

The proposed budget rings in at $6.9 trillion (nice). Here are a few key items in the plan…

Healthcare: The proposal would cap the price of insulin at $35 per month and empower Medicare to negotiate more drug prices. It would also make tax credits for health insurance premiums permanent.

Childcare: The child tax credit would increase from $2,000 to $3,600 per child and families could receive it even if they don’t owe taxes.

Going to the moon: NASA’s moon-bound Artemis program would get a budgetary boost <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30788859.3375890/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zc0Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc4ODg1OS4zMzc1ODkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C22efa435> of $500 million.

His other big goal? Reducing deficit spending by $3 trillion in the next decade to rein in the national debt.

Who’s paying for this?

Biden hopes to raise $4.7 trillion over 10 years by hiking taxes on the kind of folks whose couches aren’t against a wall.

Higher taxes for the wealthy: The budget request would reverse Trump-era tax cuts on Americans making more than $400,000 and add a new 25% minimum tax on billionaires. For people making at least $1 million, the proposal would also double the tax rate on capital gains, or the profit made by selling assets like stocks, houses, and Pokémon cards.

Higher taxes for corporations: Under the new plan, the corporate tax rate would jump to 28%, multinationals’ earnings abroad would be taxed at double the current rate, and the tax on stock buybacks would quadruple from its existing 1% rate.

Looking ahead…the GOP likes tax hikes as much as New Yorkers like a Los Angeles bagel, and the Republican-led House is already planning to reject Biden’s budget as proposed. But consider the budget an icebreaker—or more like throwing the ice into an inferno—to get conversations going.—JW

In testimony before Congress yesterday, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan H. Shaw said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30788859.3375890/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zc00_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc4ODg1OS4zMzc1ODkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccb09ad14> he was “deeply sorry” for the company’s early February train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that spilled hazardous chemicals into the surrounding soil and killed nearly 45,000 animals. In front of an antagonistic Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Shaw outlined the company’s efforts to restore the area.

According to Shaw, Norfolk Southern has committed more than $21 million to East Palestine and provided financial support to 4,400 families. However, Shaw notably didn’t promise to pay for long-term medical costs of residents or economic damage to the area.

Senators also chided Shaw for declining to endorse bipartisan rail safety legislation introduced last week by Ohio Senators Sherrod Brown and JD Vance.

Bad timing: Another Norfolk Southern train derailed in Alabama hours before the hearing. About 30 train cars derailed, according to a county news release, but no injuries or hazardous spills were reported. It marks the third major derailment since early February for Norfolk Southern.

Looking ahead…the National Transportation Safety Board said earlier this week that it opened a special investigation into safety practices at Norfolk Southern. The company’s accident rate jumped 81% between 2013 and 2022, according to Politico.—MK

The most drastic changes include vertical, TikTok-like discovery feeds for music, podcasts, and audiobooks that let you scroll through previews of each type of content.

Key performance indicators A Batman meme about Bing and google
Stat: The frequently mocked search engine Bing has cleared 100 million daily active users <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30788859.3375890/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zc1c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc4ODg1OS4zMzc1ODkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cba596773>, Microsoft’s head of consumer marketing wrote in a blog post. The search engine got a “little bit of a boost” after launching its AI-powered Bing Chat feature a month ago, but it’s also benefited from Microsoft pushing it hard on users via its Edge browser. We’re still far from everyone saying “Bing it,” though—Google has more than 1 billion daily active users.

But don’t call it sports betting—those match results are arranged in advance, so it’d be similar to wagering on an event occurring in a scripted TV show.

If this were around 10 years ago, the bets on the eventual King of Westeros would’ve totaled in the trillions.

The athletic brand is sitting on roughly $1.3 billion worth of Yeezy gear after cutting ties with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, for his antisemitic comments. But the brand is not sure how to get rid of it.

Not everything ages like fine wine

During an earnings call yesterday, the new Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden made it clear that ditching its unwanted Yeezy stock is a top priority. But the company is sort of stuck between a rock and an antisemitic sneaker:

Burning or trashing the gear would be unsustainable.

Donating the shoes could create a boom in the resale market.

Even if Adidas rebrands the items and sells them, Ye is still promised a cut of the profits.

The most likely option? Sell the kicks and donate the proceeds to charity. Gulden vaguely upvoted this solution in yesterday’s call saying, “If we sell it, I promise that the people who have been hurt by this will also get something good out of this.”

Big picture: Figuring out how to offload warehouses full of taboo merch isn’t the only headache Gulden is dealing with following the company’s breakup with Ye. Adidas reported roughly $630 million in lost sales in Q4 of 2022 thanks to the split. Gulden cautioned investors not to have high hopes for 2023, calling it a “transition year.” The company is also cutting dividends as it figures out a way to replace its $1.5 billion Ye collab.

At this point, it feels like economists have been predicting an imminent recession for so long that they’re starting to sound like that guy who insisted on spending December 31, 1999,  in a remote cabin because of Y2K. Still, one big recession warning signal reared its head this week.

What happened? When Jerome Powell told lawmakers Tuesday that recent strong economic data meant interest rates would likely climb higher than previously expected, it sent the markets into a tizzy, pushing the US Treasury yield curve to its deepest inversion <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30775253.2964846/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zbzE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc3NTI1My4yOTY0ODQ2/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C75815fe0> since 1981.

And that means…the yield for 2-year Treasury bonds exceeded the yield for 10-year ones—by a lot. It’s considered an inversion whenever the short-term yield eclipses the long-term yield. It signifies that investors expect interest rates to rise in the near term but that those hikes will ultimately damage the economy, forcing rates back down over time.

What does it have to do with a recession? A yield curve inversion has happened before every recession since the 1960s, so it’s definitely a more reliable prognosticator than your friend who has “a system” for their March Madness bracket.

Yeah, but…predicting the future is hard. Right now investors are freaked out by the Fed, but Powell is still trying to stick the (soft) landing—even if this makes it look less likely.—AR

Forget being rich in friendships, folks, it’s time to 10x that salary and start a side hustle dropshipping iPhone cases. A new study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30775253.2964846/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zbzY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc3NTI1My4yOTY0ODQ2/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C46886d60> found that happiness rises with income level—even accelerating at levels beyond $100,000 per year up to $500,000 per year.

Millionaires and billionaires might be even happier: The study’s authors just didn’t have conclusive data for salaries beyond that range (those folks are probably too happy to take surveys). This new information upends an oft-cited 2010 study that found happiness plateaued near a salary of $75,000, or ~$103k today, after inflation.

In the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, two prominent researchers (including Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner who wrote that 2010 paper) surveyed 33,391 US adults between the ages of 18 and 65 with household incomes of at least $10,000. Participants logged their happiness level when prompted at random times throughout the day via an app.

A caveat: While more money does lead to more happiness for most people, it’s not the only factor, and its emotional effect is small compared to other considerations, like time off from work. “An approximately four-fold difference in income is about equal to the effect of a weekend,” the study said.—MK

In his early days pursuing music, Ed Goldfarb spent a good chunk of his life taking on side gigs—from playing organs in church to performing country tunes for famous NASCAR drivers in a luxury penthouse.

The Biden administration is continuing its full-court press strategy against airline consolidation. Yesterday, the Justice Department sued <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30763746.2968171/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zbDU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc2Mzc0Ni4yOTY4MTcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C87a30ade> to block JetBlue’s planned $3.8 billion takeover of Spirit Airlines, claiming that the  acquisition would raise fares for consumers and decrease options in an industry already known for only having pretzels or peanuts.

Spirit, with its no snacks, 28 inches of legroom, and no-recline seats, isn’t exactly anyone’s top choice for travel, but it is the nation’s largest ultra-low-cost airline. And, according to the DOJ, Spirit getting scooped up would eliminate about half of all ultra-low-cost seats in the industry, sending ticket prices (which are already skyrocketing) up even further.

For the Biden administration’s DOJ, with its hardline attitude against mergers it considers to be anti-competitive, that’s unacceptable.

Why would prices go up?

According to internal company documents that the DOJ cites in its complaint, when Spirit starts flying a given route, average fares fall by 17%. Meanwhile, JetBlue estimates that when Spirit stops flying a route, average fares shoot up by 30%.

JetBlue has claimed that by increasing its size with the purchase of Spirit, it could better compete with the “big four” airlines: United, Delta, American, and Southwest. But according to the DOJ, JetBlue isn’t the disruptive force it once was, and has instead evolved into an “ally of the big four.”

In response to the lawsuit, JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes argued that the merger was not like Pepsi buying Coke, and instead would make his company a “distant fifth-largest airline”—a Dr Pepper, you might say.

Zoom out: The last big merger in the airline industry happened in 2016 when Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America. According to airlines.org, there have been 21 completed US airline mergers since 2001. That consolidation has made it hard for new competition to enter: Between 2007 and 2021, not a single new airline startup was formed in the country.—MK

Productivity win: Slack has finally found a way to automate a unique, personal birthday message to your coworker. The Salesforce-owned messaging app said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30763746.2968171/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zbGQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc2Mzc0Ni4yOTY4MTcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C88b65983> yesterday it’s introducing AI tools based on ChatGPT that will help you draft replies, find answers to questions, and summarize long threads or channels. There’s currently a waitlist to pilot the program.

How it works: In a world with an AI Slack assist, a five-part question from your boss at 4:59pm could become a piece of cake to tackle. The app would create a reply in seconds that you could then edit and send.

Salesforce touts the app’s potential to make workers more productive, but just how productive is up for debate as the AI-generated messages may take longer to edit and fact check than just writing them yourself. Plus, tools like Google’s AI chatbot have made headlines for giving users incorrect information <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30763746.2968171/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yMmg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc2Mzc0Ni4yOTY4MTcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6b90dcaf>.

Big picture: Slack’s new toy joins a flood of other AI apps and assistants that companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Google are unleashing on the American workforce. ChatGPT generating an unhinged poem was funny, but to commercialize the tech in a meaningful way, companies will need to make it useful for the average marketing associate to do their job.—MM

A recent study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30763746.2968171/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zbGk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc2Mzc0Ni4yOTY4MTcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0dbbd7fe> published in Nature Medicine found that the sugar alternative erythritol is associated with an increased risk of heart issues and strokes.

Our bodies produce small amounts of the compound naturally, but it’s also increasingly found in many processed foods, especially “sugar-free” products and even some toothpaste.

What did the study find?

Scientists explored the link between levels of different chemicals in the blood and the risk of heart disease.

Patients with more erythritol in their system had a higher chance of having a stroke, suffering a heart attack, or dying within three years.

It was also tied to an increased risk of blood clots in mice and human blood samples.

While erythritol is linked to health issues, it is not necessarily a cause. It’s also unclear how worried folks without medical conditions should be, as the study mostly followed a population that was already prone to heart disease (due to conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure).

Zoom out: The researchers are recommending further investigation so we can better understand whether erythritol ought to be proclaimed unsafe. In the meantime, one of the study’s authors, Dr. Stanley Hazen, is telling his patients to skip the sweetener and opt for a couple of drops of honey or a pinch of sugar instead.—SK

That’s up from 3% in 2020, but significantly lower than the 17% average during the revenge-seeking golden age of 2003–2017.

Good morning. If you had to guess, which state would you expect to have the best tippers? What about the stingiest?

We’ve got the goods. According to Toast’s Q4 2022 Restaurant Trends Report…

Delaware is the most generous state for tipping, with an average tip of 21.8% on the Toast platform.

The least generous is California. People there leave an average tip of 17.5%.

Any theories for the wide gap?

Everyone and their neighbor seemingly got an e-bike during the pandemic, but their surge in popularity has come with a nasty side effect: exploding batteries <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zZ1Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd68fdc4b> that spark deadly fires. The problem is especially evident in New York City, where on Sunday an e-bike battery sparked <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zZ1c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb4acda81> an hourslong blaze at a Bronx grocery store that injured seven.

It’s the latest in a string of fires started by the lithium-ion batteries in electric bikes and scooters. They’ve caused at least 30 fires, 40 injuries, and two deaths in NYC this year, as of Feb. 27, according to the New York Fire Department.

Last year, they ignited 216 fires—double the amount of the year before—resulting in 147 injuries and six deaths.

Lithium-ion batteries were the fourth leading cause of fire deaths in NYC last year, per the FDNY.

The number of blazes has been rising in tandem with the number of e-bikes sold: The US imported over 1 million last year, a gear shift up from 880,000 in 2021 and 450,000 in 2020, according to the Light Electric Vehicle Association.

What’s so dangerous about an e-bike battery?

It’s about the batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are a Nobel-prize-winning invention that power everything from phones to computers to electric vehicles. These batteries are safe unless they’re faulty or damaged <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zZ1g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8e1df9d4>, and e-bikes and e-scooters are subject to a lot of hard use hauling commuters and delivery workers up and over NYC’s bridges.

The batteries are also expensive (about $300 each), so low-quality and secondhand alternatives, which are more likely to be defective, have flooded the market.

It’s unlikely an e-bike will spontaneously combust midride beneath your butt. Instead, they become a hazard while in storage or when they’ve been left unattended on a charger (where they overheat).

The fires they cause are nightmarish: Lithium-ion battery fires can engulf a room in about 15 seconds, per the UL Fire Safety Research Institute. In addition, the toxic gases they release make them especially difficult to put out.

There’s a solution in the works

The New York City Council approved several bills last week that 1) add new safety and certification standards for micromobility vehicles 2) launch educational campaigns on safe usage and 3) restrict the use and sale of secondhand batteries.

It’s the city’s alternative to an outright ban, which London enacted for e-scooters in 2021 after it faced its own battery fire problem.—JW

California is “done” with Walgreens. CA Gov.

Walgreens and CVS have been threatened with legal action by Republican attorneys general if they distribute abortion medication in those states. But Newsom is not impressed, writing that Walgreens’s move “cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk.”

The Swissness Act of 2017 put guardrails around how companies can use certain Swiss symbols in their marketing, but Toblerone will no longer meet the Swissness criteria as it shifts some production to Slovakia.

A series of extreme turbulence incidents in early 2023 has air travelers wondering why the seatbelt sign has been left on so much lately. Last week alone, turbulence was responsible for: at least seven injuries aboard a transatlantic Lufthansa red-eye <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zaDA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf33a20cb>, the aborted landing of a North Carolina-bound Southwest flight <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zaDE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4d9a9d5e>, and a passenger death <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zaDI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce0d9ca5c> on a business jet traveling between New Hampshire and Virginia.

Are the skies becoming more treacherous?

Research shows that the chances of having a turbulent flight are increasing and that a changing climate might be the culprit.

Climate change makes atmospheric air currents more unstable and winds faster, causing rockier skies.

It’s also elevating the risk of clear-air turbulence, which appears out of the blue and gives pilots little time to order passengers to buckle up.

But in general, you should still be more concerned about the prospect of a canceled flight than a shaky one.

Extreme turbulence is still very rare and not usually dangerous. Only 146 people were seriously injured by severe turbulence between 2009 and 2021, per the Federal Aviation Administration—and most were not wearing their seatbelts. Airplanes are designed to withstand intense shaking, while pilots are trained to safely navigate intense wind…even if your plane meatloaf sticks to the aircraft ceiling.—SK

A storm drain? Who cares. But a storm drain officially named Stormy Drainels? That’s something to cherish.

Municipalities across the US know this, so they’re increasingly holding <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30749356.2968168/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zaDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDc0OTM1Ni4yOTY4MTY4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf3ef9d24> online naming contests to christen fixtures like snowplows, sewer grates, and garbage trucks in a bid to increase public awareness of the services available and the workers who perform them, the WSJ reports.

The Madison, Wisconsin, snowplow naming contest results came in late last month, resulting in five newly deputized plows: Saltimus Prime, Snowbi Wan Kenobi, Seymour Pavement, and Dolly Plowton.

Madison isn’t the only city with named plows. Some highlights from around the US include:

Fuhgeddaplowdit (New Paltz, NY)

Plowy McPlowFace (St. Paul, MN)

Steve (North Hero, VT)

Other pieces of equipment around the country have also gotten the pun treatment. A storm drain in Minnesota is named Drain “The Block” Johnson, a street sweeper in Virginia has been dubbed “MF BROOM,” and a garbage truck in Indiana now goes by “Bin Diesel.”

Where’d this come from? The idea of naming municipal equipment seems to have been spawned in Scotland, where a 2006 primary school contest to name gritters (snowplows) caught on in a big way. All 240 plows operated by Transport Scotland now have names.—MK

Markets: Stocks broke out of their slump last week, but investors are still facing black-diamond-level conditions in this jittery market. As usual, the Fed is playing the boogeyman: In recent comments, officials have begun to signal that they plan to raise rates higher and for longer to tame stubborn inflation.

Stock spotlight: Formula One shares reached a record high as the racing season began in Bahrain yesterday. Max Verstappen shares are also at a record high.

To begin this story, I want to jog your memory: Have you recently bought a higher-quality product even though it costs more? Hulu without ads? Fancy jeans? A Le Creuset instead of a regular ol’ Dutch oven?

Companies are hyperfocused on attracting that particular kind of customer right now. According to the NYT, they’re going all-in on “premiumization <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30739367.3376090/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY1k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDczOTM2Ny4zMzc2MDkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf6437bb6>,” which is a strategy to entice customers to pay more for what is perceived as a better-quality product or service.

Premiumization isn’t new. Starbucks famously did it with coffee in the 1990s, and airlines have been dangling a luxurious first-class experience for decades. Premiumization has been especially popular in the consumer goods space <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30739367.3376090/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY1o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDczOTM2Ny4zMzc2MDkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C16f98ac8>.

But what’s new is the breadth of companies that are trying to extract more $$$ from their wealthiest customers. Execs referenced the premiumization concept in close to 60 earnings calls and investor meetings in the past several weeks, per the New York Times. A few examples:

Krispy Kreme, which offered bargain deals last year, is now aiming to generate “excitement around our premium specialty doughnuts.”

Six Flags has raised prices “in order to elevate the guest experience.”

Even WD-40 is souping up its cans with things like a “smart straw” to get consumers to pay more.

Why is this happening?

Companies facing slowdowns in other areas see growth opportunities in upselling their wealthiest customers, who are sitting on more than $1 trillion in excess savings since the pandemic.

And those customers seem willing to play along. “All around the world, people are spending more <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30739367.3376090/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zYy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDczOTM2Ny4zMzc2MDkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C155c6872> on better products,” L’Oréal’s CEO Nicolas Hieronimus recently said. “The pandemic has generated this desire to pamper yourself.”

Big picture: The urge to focus on premium products could result in fewer options for lower-income Americans, who spend a greater share of their income on essentials like housing and food, the NYT notes.

The auto market is already out of reach for many Americans. At the end of 2022, only 10 car models were priced below $25,000, compared to 36 at the end of 2017.

Currently, only 1.2% of those areas are protected, but the UN High Seas Treaty hopes to turn 30% of international waters into protected areas by 2030. Almost 10% of global marine species are at risk of extinction, per the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The bills include provisions that would ban gender studies majors and minors in higher education, open up media organizations to more libel lawsuits, and create a universal school choice voucher program. Gov. Ron DeSantis, the champion of this conservative agenda, is expected to run for president in 2024.

Despite a cyclone of headlines and hype, ChatGPT remains almost as unpopular on campus as the overachiever who asks a question when the professor is about to end class.

In a survey of 520 US college students, a Morning Brew/Generation Lab poll <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30739367.3376090/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zZDY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDczOTM2Ny4zMzc2MDkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbc2c5055> found that 40% have never heard of the chatbot from OpenAI.

Of those who have heard of ChatGPT, 52% have never used it.

And the students who said they do fire up ChatGPT…don’t use it all that much, as 55% of respondents who said they’ve used ChatGPT do so “almost never.”

Of course, ChatGPT was released just a few months ago—so in a sense it is quite remarkable that 60% of college students have heard of it. Still, it hasn’t made major inroads on college campuses yet, even while many instructors warn the new tech could create havoc in the classroom.

Uses for ChatGPT

Among the students who do use ChatGPT…what are they using it for?

For giggles: 71% of students who’ve used ChatGPT said they use it in part for entertainment or just for fun.

As Google: 32% of students who’ve used ChatGPT said they use it in part for quick answers to simple questions, and 31% to understand complex topics.

For…cheating? 17% of students who’ve heard of ChatGPT said they have direct knowledge of friends having used ChatGPT to cheat.

“Hell week” on Wall Street. As we mentioned at the top, this week features several potential landmines <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30739367.3376090/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zZDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDczOTM2Ny4zMzc2MDkw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C39880873> for the stock market. One of them is the jobs report on Friday. Employment numbers have been on the rise, and continued strength in the labor market could lead to more interest rate hikes. Another key event this week: Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony on Capitol Hill. He’s expected to field questions on the trajectory of inflation and the looming debt-ceiling crisis.

Daylight saving time begins. This week might be the last time you leave work while it’s still dark out for a while, because we’re “springing forward” on Sunday and getting more daylight in the evening. Some lawmakers are reviving efforts to make DST permanent.

So, why do men avoid the turn-and-cough? Several potential reasons: their belief they might not need to, the concern of receiving bad news, and the taboo nature of talking about health issues with other dudes, the NYT suggests.

Good morning. Cocaine Bear has only been in theaters for one week but a potential sequel has already emerged: Cocaine Hippo. It wouldn’t be about a hippo on cocaine, but instead about the community of hippos that’s flourished in Colombia thanks to Pablo Escobar. In the late 1970s, the cocaine kingpin imported four hippos to his estate, and in the decades since those four have multiplied into a small village of 130.

Now, with hippos considered an invasive species in Colombia, authorities want to capture 70 and send them to sanctuaries abroad. Elizabeth Banks—you have our number.

Amazon’s HQ2 is starting to look more like HQ1.5. The e-commerce giant announced yesterday that it’s halting the construction of its much-hyped second headquarters in Arlington, VA.

Construction status update

The first part of the project, Metropolitan Park, is on track for a ribbon cutting this summer.

Breaking ground on the swanky office park known as PenPlace, which would encompass three 22-story towers and a sleek helix-shaped building, has been put off indefinitely.

Met Park can accommodate 14,000 workers, which is more than enough for Amazon’s 8,000 local employees. And headcount is unlikely to skyrocket any time soon: Amazon began laying off 18,000 employees in January (the steepest job cuts in its history).

Plans and promises

Amazon chose the DC area as the site of its HQ2 in 2018, after a cutthroat bidding battle among dozens of cities nationwide that resembled the municipal version of The Bachelor.

The company promised to bring 25,000 jobs to the region and turbocharge the local economy in exchange for $800 million in tax benefits and infrastructure improvements.

It says it does plan to build PenPlace and reach the workforce goal eventually. But for now, it’s not short on office space: Its employees still spend a lot of time working from home, even after a recent companywide mandate to come into the office three days a week.

The company is also reducing its physical footprint elsewhere. It vacated an office tower in its hometown, Seattle, earlier this year.

Zoom out: Amazon’s pause on its Northern Virginia expansion is part of a bigger trend. Big Tech companies like Meta and Twitter have cut down on their real estate footprint to save money. And it’s just one of the many ominous signs for the commercial real estate market since people no longer go into the office every workday.—SK

The British government has been trying to woo the company to relist in London, and Arm said it wasn’t ruling out a future London IPO. But it’s a big loss for London for now, and it heightens concerns that the UK market is not competitive internationally. Investment bankers are pegging the company’s valuation between $30 billion and $70 billion, per Bloomberg.

Walgreens said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30728929.102437/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY3Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcyODkyOS4xMDI0Mzc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca5f42208> Thursday that it will not distribute abortion pills in 20 states, including ones where the drugs are legal. The announcement follows a threat from those states’ Republican attorneys general to take legal action against the pharmacy if it sold the drug mifepristone.

Medication abortions account for more than half of all legal abortions in the US, and mifepristone is part of a popular two-drug process. In a bid to expand abortion access after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the FDA decided in January that approved drug stores could carry mifepristone—which had previously only been available at clinics.

Walgreens, the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US, said it would work to become one of those pharmacies, but quickly saw pushback from anti-abortion lawmakers. Now, the company says it won’t sell the pill in those states, either in its stores or by mail, even though the FDA also said mifepristone could be mailed to states with abortion bans.

This isn’t the only battle surrounding mifepristone: A ruling is expected soon in a Texas lawsuit filed by several anti-abortion groups aiming to pull <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30728929.102437/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zY3c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcyODkyOS4xMDI0Mzc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce9f9edfc> the pill off the market nationwide.—MM

If you’ve been waiting a year to hear Chris Rock’s hot take on that little incident at the Oscars, tonight’s the night.

Live TV events where anything can happen are still drawing eyeballs even as more viewers are binge-watching shows on their own timetable (15 million people were watching when Will Smith attacked Rock as he hosted last year’s awards gala). And now, a week before this year’s Oscars, Netflix is betting that everybody doesn’t hate Chris as it rolls out its first-ever live-streaming event for its 231 million subscribers.

Rock’s special is called Selective Outrage, and it’s expected to be a version of the show he’s been touring with (which, yes, has included jokes about The Slap), but tonight he’ll have 13 cameras on him as he riffs in Baltimore. Netflix has good reason to think Rock’s stand-up can deliver virtual viewers: The shows have been taking in about $700,000 per night from ticket sales, according to the concert trade publication Pollstar.

Zoom out: Rock may be Netflix’s live event guinea pig, but it’s not the only streamer to turn to the old TV staple. Amazon Prime has also gone all in, paying ~$1 billion/year to broadcast Thursday Night Football.—AR

Between 2010 and 2020, 31% of kids who checked into the university hospital’s burn center with injuries said instant noodles were the cause. To reduce the risk, the researchers suggest having an adult take the noodle cup out of the microwave and then keep it from the kids until it cools down a bit.

Good morning. On Wednesday, we asked you to channel Larry David and discuss whether it’s socially acceptable for two people dining together to order the same dish. And after reviewing your responses over the last two days, it’s clear that people are pretty split on this:

Readers against duplicative ordering talked about the delight of sharing food and the need to “cover your bases” when going to a restaurant (especially a new one).

Readers who said it was OK to order the same dish argued it’s unfair to the person who orders second, and, look—eating at a restaurant is supposed to be fun, not a chore…so don’t stress. Order what you want.

And then there’s Regina B.: “My whole group of eight has ordered the same thing.”

It’s no secret that the government considers TikTok a national security threat. But in an interview with Bloomberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zN1o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cee8295dd> yesterday, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo suggested that the government is concerned about the dangers posed by other Chinese apps, too.

“If what we’re worried about is Chinese-backed companies being on tens of millions of American phones, including members of the military and privacy concerns, data concerns, misinformation concerns—it doesn’t just apply to TikTok,” she said.

Thing is, Chinese apps are the most popular apps in the US right now. The top three free apps on Apple’s App Store yesterday were Temu, CapCut, and TikTok, while Google Play’s were Temu, TikTok, and Street Fighter: Duel—with Chinese fast-fashion company Shein chilling at No. 4.

Except for Street Fighter, all of these apps are based in China and have been downloaded onto American devices hundreds of millions of times.

CapCut is a video editor for TikTok owned by the same tech giant, ByteDance.

Temu is a shopping app that was already gaining traction in the US late last year but boarded a rocket ship to the most-downloaded spot after airing two spots for its “Shop Like a Billionaire” commercial during the Super Bowl.

For now, TikTok has the biggest target <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zNy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9f185885> on its back:

Legislation to ban TikTok in the US was approved by an influential House committee this week, though it still has to face trials by fire with the full House and Senate.

Government agencies have 30 days from Feb. 27 to ensure TikTok is deleted from all federal devices and systems.

Experts can’t agree on whether Chinese apps are a threat

An exec at the think tank founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote last month <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zN18_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb49438b8> that all of these uber-popular Chinese apps, including the messenger WeChat and game apps from Tencent, “could pose similar challenges [to TikTok], particularly with respect to data harvesting, data exploitation, and—possibly—covert influence.”

But others say the fears are #ghosttok-level overblown…and judging by the apps’ enormous number of downloads, the average American ain’t afraid of no posts. For all the scrutiny of TikTok, technologist and author Kevin Xu wrote <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zODA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7e26e3b8>, “US legislators, policymakers, and think-tankers have yet to produce any concrete evidence of harm done by the app.”—JW

Mortgage rates are spiking…again.

While mortgage rates fell earlier this winter, they’re jumping again in response to strong economic growth and hot inflation data, which could signal more interest rate hikes from the Fed. Higher mortgage rates combined with already astronomical home prices have led to the most unaffordable housing market on record, per Bloomberg.

The case drew national attention due to the Murdaugh family’s powerful influence in the local area and Alex Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes (which prosecutors claimed motivated the murders: He wanted to gain sympathy and avoid investigations into his financial misdeeds). Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison for each murder charge.

That’s just a slight uptick from the 80% women earned relative to men 20 years before, in 2002. The study shows how the progress made on the gender pay gap in the late 20th century has petered out in 21st, despite women now having higher educational attainment than men. In 1982, women earned an average of 65% of what men earned.

Double it and give it to the next year. California has already received twice the average snowfall it normally sees by March, according to UC Berkeley researchers. Some mountainous regions have been slammed with 40 feet of snow since the start of winter.

But just in the last week, California has been hit with an obscene amount of fresh pow. On Wednesday, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for 13 counties, including San Bernardino—where some towns will likely be cut off from the rest of the state for weeks.

California’s Joshua Tree National Park closed on Wednesday because of inclement weather. And there’s no reopening date in sight for Yosemite National Park, which has been shut down since Saturday.

For ski resorts, it’s too much of a good thing. Mountain High in Southern California averages 67 inches of snowfall every season. But its slopes received 93 inches (about eight feet) last week alone. Unfortunately, Mountain High and other SoCal resorts are still snowed in and are at the mercy of unplowed highways.

An out-of-control, soot-like whiskey fungus is spreading in Tennessee and causing a rift <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30714817.2969871/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8zOGQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDcxNDgxNy4yOTY5ODcx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C77560b1e> between residents and famed whiskey-maker Jack Daniel’s.

The fungus, named Baudoinia compniacensis after a distiller who first made note of it in the 1870s, feeds off of ethanol vapors released during the whiskey aging process. For months, residents of a rural Tennessee county where Jack Daniel’s has six barrelhouses (and plans to build up to 20) have complained that the fungus coats basically all outdoor surfaces, including trees, house siding, and patio furniture.

Studies have shown that the fungus isn’t hazardous to humans—and it dirties but doesn’t damage property—but residents are nonetheless peeved with Jack Daniel’s over its spread, filing a lawsuit that’s ultimately forced the company to stop construction on a new barrelhouse.

Residents are asking for Jack Daniel’s to fund an environmental study to see if the vapors or fungus harm humans, and install an air filtration system to slow their spread. The company has resisted installing filters and claims it could impact the whiskey’s flavor.—MK

Not only has the team faced controversy over its name, ownership, and workplace culture, but it also scored an F- grade in three out of eight categories in the survey, which the NFL Players Association conducted in order to surface the best practices for running a franchise. Seems like teams could learn a thing or two from the Minnesota Vikings, which nabbed first place.

Good morning. It’s the 28th and final day of February. Have you wondered why February is shorter than the other months? Turns out, we have ancient Roman superstitions to thank.

To make a long story short, Roman king Numa Pompilius tweaked the calendar to sync it with the lunar year, which included changing every month to 29 days (because even numbers were unlucky at that time). One month, though, needed to have an even number of days, and February was selected since it was when the Romans held rituals for the dead.

And so, February was dropped down to 28 days. And despite numerous changes to the calendar over thousands of years, it’s (mostly) stuck.

The fate of the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness plan—and the monthly budget of tens of millions of Americans—rests on oral arguments that the Supreme Court will hear <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWXM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5beb551> today.

Given the court’s 6–3 conservative majority, many legal experts see a tough road ahead for the ~$430 billion debt relief program. The conservative SCOTUS has reined in Biden’s executive power multiple times already, from throwing out his administration’s eviction moratorium and large business vaccination-or-testing requirement, to significantly dampening the EPA’s power to fight climate change.

So, what’s the court expected to hear today? Let’s take a look.

It’s about harm

There are two legal challenges to debt cancellation:

One from six Republican-led states (Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina)

Another from two Texas borrowers backed by a conservative advocacy group

Before SCOTUS can issue any ruling on the Biden administration’s constitutional authority to cancel debt, it must first decide if these challengers have standing to sue—i.e., if any of them are specifically harmed by debt cancellation.

So far, lower courts have found that they are. The GOP states have standing thanks to a semi-independent loan servicing company, MOHELA, created by the state of Missouri, a court ruled. Missouri has argued that since MOHELA would lose money if there were fewer loans to service, it would put less money into a state education fund, and the state would be sufficiently harmed. A different court ruled that the two Texas borrowers have standing, as neither fully qualified for forgiveness under the program.

The Biden administration is expected to lean heavily on this question, arguing that none of the plaintiffs have sufficient standing to challenge the loan cancellation program. Many experts see this tactic as the administration’s best chance to win since it would be easier than convincing the justices of its power to cancel debt.

Zoom out: The Biden administration has said that whatever the court’s decision is, the student loan payment pause that’s been in place for almost three years will end 60 days after the case is resolved (or at the end of August, whichever comes first). SCOTUS is expected to announce its ruling before the court’s term ends in late June.—MK

The Biden administration says that calls into question every rule the agency has ever made and every enforcement action it has taken.

DeSantis went after the special district when Disney came out against a law he backed, known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics. “Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,” the governor, who is expected to launch a presidential run soon, said at the signing ceremony.

Diplomats are cracking a Guinness after making major progress on the peskiest Brexit issue: The United Kingdom and the European Union hammered out a deal <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWXo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc9e82279> over Northern Ireland trade yesterday.

Why the deal is a big deal

The UK–EU divorce generated the problem of handling the only land border between them, the one separating Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (a separate country that’s in the EU). Imposing typical customs controls would’ve been risky: The open border between them is a legacy of the Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of political violence known as “the Troubles.”

As a workaround, the UK and EU signed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, which preserved the frictionless border status quo. Instead, customs checks were introduced for goods moving from the island of Great Britain (which encompasses England, Scotland, and Wales) to Northern Ireland. The new agreement builds on this arrangement.

What’s in the deal?

There will now be minimal customs controls for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while goods transiting into the Republic of Ireland will be checked normally.

The Protocol left some EU laws in place in Northern Ireland, but the new agreement pares that number down.

Looking ahead…The agreement isn’t a done deal until it passes through the UK Parliament (where there is likely to be opposition from hardline Brexiters and Northern Irish parties) and parts of it get the go-ahead from the EU’s 27 member states.—SK

WORK

More Americans are choosing the part-time life <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWUU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Dda8342e4> A hand with a clock <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWUU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Eda8342e4> Hannah Minn
Over a million Americans joined the part-time workforce in December and January—and most of them chose the temporary grind over a full-time hustle, according to Labor Department data analyzed by the WSJ.

Key word: chose. As of last month, over 22 million part-timers were working fewer than 35 hours per week voluntarily, compared to just 4 million that wanted full-time hours and couldn’t get them. That nearly six-to-one ratio is the highest it’s been <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30675860.101966/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yWUY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY3NTg2MC4xMDE5NjY/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1c71d9e0> in two decades, per the WSJ.

Why the downshift?

Early in the pandemic, the number of Americans doing part-time work “for economic reasons,” as the Labor Department classifies it, spiked as layoffs rocked the economy, peaking in April 2020. But after that, the vibe shifted: More people started choosing to work part-time “for noneconomic reasons,” such as caregiving and personal health.

And there may be more 9-to-5ers waiting for the chance to clear their G Cals. “A lot of people want to work part-time, but the options aren’t really there,” Ernie Park, who left his full-time tech job to take an hourly gig and start a family farm, told the WSJ. “For companies that get on this, they can scoop up some really great talent.”—JW

Good morning and welcome back to the week. Yesterday, I attended an MLB spring training game that, no joke, lasted two hours and 16 minutes. Before you ask: It wasn’t cut short by rain, and it did go a full nine innings.

Markets: If you’re looking for something to blame for stocks’ recent backpedaling, throw shade at the bond market. A major sell-off in bonds has sent Treasury yields higher, making stocks less attractive to investors. Last week, the major US stock indexes posted their biggest weekly losses of the year.

New report reignites lab leak debate <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVmY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D8445050c> P4 laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on April 17, 2020 <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVmY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E8445050c> Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images
Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down much of the world, we still don’t know how it started.

But the Department of Energy is ready to submit its best guess. In a new report based on fresh intelligence, the agency has concluded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVmc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f399837> that Covid-19 most likely spread to humans as a result of a mistake at a Chinese laboratory (aka the “lab leak” theory), the WSJ reports.

Important note: In making this determination, the Energy Dept. is about as self-assured as any Michael Cera character—it reportedly has “low confidence” that this theory is correct.

Also, why would the Energy Dept. have information about a pandemic’s origins? Little-known fact: The Energy Dept. oversees a network of 17 national laboratories, and some of those labs do advanced bioresearch. The agency frequently leverages this lab network to gather information, rather than relying on typical intelligence operations, according to the NYT.

But there’s still no consensus

In endorsing the lab leak theory, the Energy Dept. joins the FBI, which has concluded with “moderate confidence” that Covid originated accidentally from a Chinese lab: the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The two agencies reportedly arrived at this conclusion via different methods.

However, four other US agencies and the National Intelligence Council have concluded that Covid originated through natural transmission from an infected animal. But they, too, have low confidence their conclusions are correct.

One piece of evidence that’s missing from the natural transmission theory? The animal that hypothetically did the infecting hasn’t been identified. Given all this uncertainty, two other US agencies haven’t reached a conclusion on Covid’s beginnings yet.

So, if you’re doing the math at home: Four US agencies believe it was natural transmission, two say lab leak, and two are undecided.

Zoom out: Scientists say it’s important to make every effort to learn how Covid-19, a pandemic that’s caused nearly 7 million deaths globally, began, so we can better prevent the next one.

But with the Chinese government thwarting investigations by global authorities, there may only be so much information the US can gather. And it might never be able to confidently answer the question: How did Covid begin?

Twitter cuts more jobs.

When Musk bought the company last fall, there were roughly 7,500 people working there. Product Manager Esther Crawford was one of those let go—she had been heading up the Twitter Blue verification subscription service.

The boat had set sail from Turkey and was carrying at least 150 people from countries including Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan, and Iran. The central Mediterranean is the most dangerous migration route on the planet, accounting for more than 20,000 deaths and disappearances since 2014, per the UN’s Missing Migrants Project.

In an MLB spring training game on Saturday, the Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox ended in a 6–6 tie after Braves player Cal Conley struck out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVm8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4d9c5db9> for not getting set in the batter’s box in time.

In time. That’s not a phrase you often hear associated with baseball, but you’d better get used to it because this season, baseball has entered its Sonic the Hedgehog era.

Over concerns it’s getting disrupted by faster-paced sports, MLB is disrupting itself by introducing new rules <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30665546.3404422/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVnA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY2NTU0Ni4zNDA0NDIy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3d72c436> this year to speed up the game and generate more offense. These rules include…

A pitch clock so pitchers (and hitters) can’t loaf around in between pitches.

The elimination of extreme defensive shifts to encourage more offense.

Bigger bases to boost the number of stolen bases.

Limiting the number of mound “disengagements,” like pickoff throws.

It’ll take some getting used to. Strange scenarios in the first spring training games showed how players and teams will need to adjust to the new rules. On Friday, San Diego Padres star Manny Machado became the first MLB player to begin an at-bat down 0–1 in the count for stepping into the batter’s box too late.

Big picture: For fans who love baseball but can’t justify spending 3+ hours watching it, these could be welcome changes. That same Padres–Mariners game on Friday took just 2:29 to complete—about 40 minutes shorter than last year’s regular-season average, per ESPN.

Self-cleaning is for more than just ovens. While there’s plenty of debate <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C821d865e> over whether touchscreens in cars are safe or convenient, there’s no denying they’re covered in more fingerprints than a crime scene. But according to a recent patent filing, GM has solved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C014dab58> that problem. The automaker has invented a self-cleaning screen to save your sleeve from having to do the work. It’s got a coating that will break down those smudgy prints after being activated by violet light from pixels inside the screen.

There’s a right time to exercise for a longer life. It’s not news that exercise can help you live longer, but a new study of ~92,000 people in the UK suggests that if longevity <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C87c672c5> is your goal, you might want to get your workout in after lunch. The study found that people who work out between 11am and 5pm are less likely to die prematurely than people who #riseandgrind. This upside of afternoon exercise was most pronounced for the elderly, men, people who were generally less active, and people with cardiovascular conditions.

A promising new drug to defeat superbugs. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have developed a new type of antibiotic <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU1Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf03c3121> that cures mice of infections from bacteria deemed close to untreatable in humans. Even more importantly, the bacteria developed almost no resistance to the drug. If the drug turns out to work the same way for humans, then it could be a big step forward, since the WHO considers antimicrobial resistance a huge and growing threat to human health, food security, and even the economy.

The legendary wrestling promotion WWE is on the market, with fans holding their breath to see who the buyer will be.

Whoever snags it, it’ll cost them a pretty penny: Owner and CEO Vince McMahon reportedly wants $9 billion, according to Bloomberg. The 77-year-old retired from the company amid a sex scandal last year—but recently returned to oversee preparations for the potential sale.

Not many companies have been a bigger part of American pop culture than WWE (and probably no others have had their CEO fake-assaulted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU00_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C745028a6> and shaved bald by a future US president), so let’s look at how it came to be such a juggernaut.

First, WWE took over TV

Vince McMahon purchased WWE from his father in 1982, and turned the regional promotion originally active in the Northeast into an international phenomenon by recruiting top talent from other companies and getting its matches on national television.

* The company launched its flagship pay-per-view live event, WrestleMania, in 1985, which would draw record-shattering crowds and secure its dominance in the industry.

* WWE (then called WWF) matches quickly became a prime-time TV staple. Millions tuned in weekly to watch flamboyantly costumed larger-than-life personalities play out colorful storylines, talk smack, and use their acrobatic prowess to feign beating the living hell out of each other.

The names of early superstars like Hulk Hogan and André the Giant will probably ring a bell, but the most important persona in WWE history is arguably McMahon himself. He was a regular presence <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU04_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce700eaac> at the ring, never shying away <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yU08_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4f5cb219> from stunts like tossing a colleague into a trash truck.

WWE further hit its stride in the ’90s, ushering in an iconic period known as the “Attitude Era.” The company went all-in on mature content, in a battle for Monday night ratings with rival promotion WCW. Matches were laced with profanity, harsher violence, and sexual explicitness.

The Attitude Era ended when WWE bought out WCW. But its legacy lives on—it propelled personalities like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin to fame beyond pro wrestling circles.

Then WWE won over the internet

WWE’s TV ratings declined following the Attitude Era. Some attribute it to an eventual move toward PG content, while others blame creative missteps and the aging of popular stars.

WWE nonetheless posted record revenue last year. Its live events continue to draw impressive crowds, and it’s hugely popular on social media and streaming platforms.

* WWE’s YouTube channel counts upward of 92 million subscribers (more than the NFL, NBA, and MLB combined), and it has 20 million followers on TikTok.

This massive following makes it extremely attractive to advertisers chasing after new markets and could drive up its sale price, according to the Associated Press.

Looking ahead…Endeavor Group Holdings, the owner of UFC, as well as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, are among those rumored to be eyeing the company. WWE’s stock price has gone up almost 50% in the past year, in part due to expectations of an impending sale.—SK

  Place to be: A darkness retreat A house at Sky Cave Retreats Sky Cave Retreats It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Want to shed light on a big life decision? Maybe spending time in complete darkness will help.

Aaron Rodgers is hoping it will. The Green Bay Packers QB emerged from a darkness retreat <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30652798.3409462/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yVDU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY1Mjc5OC4zNDA5NDYy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C42fdf0dc> in southern Oregon this week as he contemplates whether to continue playing for the Packers…or in the NFL at all.

How does a darkness retreat work? Sky Cave Retreats, the facility where Rodgers blacked out, allows people to ponder life’s big questions in partially underground rooms devoid of light, owner Scott Berman told ESPN. These rooms have a bed, a bathroom, a floor mat, and…that’s pretty much it. It’s just you and your thoughts, only interrupted by Berman delivering a day’s worth of meals to your door.

While nothing screams 2023 more than a “darkness retreat,” a variation of the practice has been around for millennia, originating in regions of India, China, and Tibet, according to the Sky Cave website. But if you’re hoping to go full Bane mode—at least at Sky Cave—it’s booked solid for the next 18 months.—NF

Good morning. Today marks the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, a seismic event with impacts that have been felt everywhere. This morning, we’re going to (try to) synthesize all that’s transpired over the last year, then tomorrow we’ll look ahead...because this conflict is far from over.

Exactly one year ago today, Russian tanks rolled across Ukrainian borders, setting off the largest armed conflict since World War II.

Reverberations from the war have impacted people from Illinois to Islamabad, straining economies and reshaping political agendas worldwide. While combat continues in eastern Ukraine, let’s look back on how the Russian–Ukraine war has changed the world over the past year.

The scale of devastation

At least 7,199 Ukrainian civilians have died, more than 11,000 have been injured (both figures are the latest UN estimate and are likely a major undercount), and as many as a 100,000 of its soldiers have died or sustained injuries.

Russian military casualties are believed to be approaching 200,000, per US officials.

More than 8 million Ukrainian refugees (~20% of the country's prewar population) have fled for other European countries. Hundreds of thousands of Russians also left their country.

Economic losses

The war has cost Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars in damaged infrastructure and caused its GDP to plummet 30% in 2022.

Russia’s output contracted by just over 2%, surprising many economists who believed a meltdown was imminent.

But economist Sergei Guriev cautions against using GDP to measure the performance of a wartime economy, since military expenditures can distort the big picture. He says Russia’s economy is worse off than it seems, and points to a significant decline in Russia’s consumer spending and a higher-than-expected increase in its government budget deficit.

Shifting global trade

Russians now have to shop abroad to snag a Big Mac or a pair of Levi’s jeans. Over 1,000 multinationals <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30645048.2761552/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yUDQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY0NTA0OC4yNzYxNTUy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C161b4af4>, including Microsoft and Nike, said they’d limit their operations within Russia’s borders or leave altogether in the first months of the war, according to a group of Yale researchers led by management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.

Sonnenfeld says that the corporate exodus from Russia is six times bigger than the one that ensued during the apartheid era in South Africa, which at the time—1988—was the largest in history.

But most damaging to the Russian economy has been the action of governments abroad. Due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is now the most sanctioned country in the world, with restrictions on its energy exports, strategic imports, and access to the global financial system.

And the EU, which at times relied on Russia for almost half of its natural gas imports, has cut those levels to less than 10%, according to Axios.

Zoom out: The biggest international conflict since World War II has spurred many countries to reconsider their approach to national defense. Notably, Germany and Japan appear to have abandoned their customary pacifism, promising to ramp up their military spending, and the US is prioritizing increasing its arms stockpiles.—SK

Stay tuned tomorrow when we'll dive into what the next year might hold for the war in Ukraine.

Portland, OR, came to a halt after receiving nearly 11 inches of snow—the city’s second-snowiest day on record. The storms aren’t over: Down in SoCal, Mount Baldy east of LA is forecast to get 4.5 feet of snow by Saturday. But things couldn’t have been more different in Washington, DC, which baked in 81-degree temps yesterday.

All of the animals killed from the toxic train derailment were aquatic species, but none appear to have been endangered or threatened. Officials also said that live fish have reappeared in one of the waterways impacted by the derailment.

Murdaugh blamed his lies on his addiction to opioids, saying his thinking was clouded and he knew he would be a suspect because he discovered the bodies. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have asserted that Murdaugh slayed his family to win sympathy because his financial crimes were about to be revealed (he’s also facing ~100 charges for those alleged crimes).

Products labeled as “milk” do not have to come from an udder, according to new guidance <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30645048.2761552/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yT0g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDY0NTA0OC4yNzYxNTUy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6a1a0939>issued by the FDA yesterday. The rules are still in draft form for now, but if they get finalized, it would be a blow to Big Milk—which has been crying over spilled alt-milk for years.

The dairy industry has long argued that plant-based milks dilute the meaning of the term “milk,” and has instead called them “beverages.” But the FDA said yesterday that consumers aren’t confused by the term and that makers of soy, almond, oat, cashew, hemp, and whatever other milks cafes charge extra for should be able to label their cartons “milk”...as long as they keep the plant source up front.

The new draft rules also suggest that alt-milk-makers add an extra label indicating when they’re less nutritious than cow’s milk, which didn’t go over well with plant-based food advocacy groups.

Dairy hasn’t been dethroned yet: Despite the rising popularity of nondairy milk in the US (almond is No. 1, but oat is gaining on it), the cow-based kind still outsells it five times over. Sales of cow’s milk totaled $12.3 billion for roughly the past year compared to $2.5 billion for nondairy alternatives, per NielsenIQ.—JW

The real story: The movie is loosely based on a 1985 incident in which a drug dealer dropped 75 pounds of cocaine from an airplane along the Georgia–Tennessee border. He tried to jump out after it, but his parachute failed and he plummeted to his death. A few months later, authorities found a ripped duffel bag and a dead bear that tested positive for cocaine.

The botched drug smuggling story became a local legend. And 38 years after the powder fell from the sky, we get to see the Elizabeth Banks-directed film that answers the vital question: “OK, what if the bear didn’t die?”

No bears were harmed. In fact there were no bears near the set. Instead, stuntman and motion capture artist Alan Henry played the bear during filming, wearing a bear head and walking on all fours with special attachments on his arms. Peter Jackson’s visual effects company, Weta FX, added the full CGI bear (which ate up most of the movie's $35 million budget) after filming.—MM

Good morning. It’s been a busy week of Morning Brew announcements, but we hope you’ve got room for one more.

We’re excited to introduce a new interview series in the newsletter, Inside Jobs, that aims to expand your perception of what a “career” could be. We’ve been talking to folks with unconventional jobs—from a hot-air balloon pilot to a professional basketball shooting coach—to learn more about their niche industries and how they found themselves on that career path.

Today, we’ve got an interview with the co-founder and CEO of a dating app photography company. Check out his profile tips after the news.

Ozempic may be TikTok’s new favorite weight loss drug, but it served a different demographic before dieting celebrities: Type 2 diabetes patients. Now, the drug is in short supply <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C10c0933c>.

As more people inject the drug for weight loss, diabetes patients are pharmacy-hopping to find stores that have Ozempic in stock, lowering their dosages to make their supplies last longer, and attempting to switch medications. The company that makes it, Novo Nordisk, expects supply to be iffy through mid-March.

Meanwhile on TikTok…

#Ozempic, #ozempicweightloss, and #ozempicchallenge have a combined 785 million views on TikTok, where use of the drug is a viral trend <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C426f2f8b>. This year, use of Ozempic has grown 69% and its higher dose alternative Wegovy, 75%, according Novo Nordisk.

Ozempic may be having its moment now, but it’s not new:

The FDA approved Ozempic, generically known as semaglutide, for treating Type 2 diabetes in 2017.

It blew up when people noticed that one of its side effects was weight loss, and in 2021, the FDA approved semaglutide, under the brand name Wegovy, for that use.

The problem is that Wegovy can also be hard to find. But as TikTok would say, everybody’s so creative <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS3o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8c7afb74>, and it’s a common practice for doctors to prescribe medications for something other than their FDA-approved use. So, doctors scribble up Ozempic prescriptions for weight loss.

There’s another reason a doctor might prescribe Ozempic even if their patient isn’t diabetic: While diabetes drugs are always covered by insurance companies, drugs for weight loss often are not. And a one-month supply of Wegovy costs upward of $1,300.

Backlash is building: The American Diabetes Association is telling doctors to give priority for Ozempic back to diabetes patients, and numerous celebrities have spoken out about its rampant off-label use and potential side effects.—JW

At least 75 million people were under winter weather alerts as of yesterday, and the National Weather Service has cautioned that a prolonged, coast-to-coast winter storm <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cddf4d079> will impact just about every region of the US today. It really does mean coast to coast: Parts of Los Angeles are under the area’s first-ever blizzard warning. The storm has already begun to wreak havoc on travel, with at least 1,400 flights canceled so far. Meanwhile, it’s going to feel like summer in much of the mid-Atlantic, with temps in Washington, DC, expected to hit almost 80 degrees.

The first collaboration between the streamer and the league, Quarterback is slated for a summer premiere. Just one season has been ordered so far.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a nonprofit investment manager controlled by church leaders have agreed to pay $5 million in fines to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission’s claims they used shell companies to keep the size of their massive investment portfolio a secret <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C57a15f78> for more than two decades.

What regulators claim: The SEC said Tuesday that from 1997 through 2019, the investment manager, Ensign Peak, did not file required paperwork laying out all of its holdings. Instead, the leaders of the faith, widely known as the Mormon church, used 13 shell companies to file smaller disclosures. The church feared “negative consequences” from publicly sharing its investments, which by 2018 had grown to $32 billion, the SEC said.

What the church says: Like most entities that tangle with the SEC, the church has neither admitted nor denied the allegations. But it did release a statement that said: “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed.”

Looking ahead…we probably won’t hear too much more on the matter from the church, which has historically kept mum about financial matters, outside of encouraging members to tithe 10% of their income.—AR

Bing and Google are already asking us to trust AI with search results, and now Spotify is asking us to trust it with the aux. Yesterday, the music streamer launched <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS0w_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7ecf80e8> a new AI feature called DJ to give users the experience of having their own private radio host at all times.

DJ operates like…well…a DJ, curating music and occasionally delivering commentary about specific tracks and artists. So far, no plans for trivia contests, 20 straight minutes of local commercials, or the ability for someone in the region to call in and dedicate a Whitesnake song to their ex-wife.

Both the voice and the info it’s providing are AI-generated, but DJ is based on the voice of Spotify exec Xavier “X” Jernigan (though the company suggested that it could expand voice options in the future).

Like all good DJs, DJ will only talk after every fifth songs or so. You’ll be able to shift the mood by pressing a button at the bottom of the screen.

Zoom out: This isn’t Spotify’s first AI rodeo. The company already uses the tech to deliver users customized playlists. So far, DJ is only available in English for premium subscribers in the US and Canada.—MK

Key performance indicators Victor Wembanyama on the basketball court Catherine Steenkeste/Getty Images
Stat: Take Shaquille O’Neal and add four inches in height—that’s how tall Victor Wembanyama stands on a basketball court. The 19-year-old French phenom is 7 feet, 5 inches tall in shoes <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30631792.103071/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yS1A_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYzMTc5Mi4xMDMwNzE/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6dd44a6d> and has a wingspan of eight feet, according to a new ESPN report. Blending size and skill, Wembanyama is the most highly anticipated basketball prospect since LeBron James. And when he’s selected No. 1 overall in this summer’s NBA Draft (which is pretty much guaranteed), he’ll become the tallest player selected in the lottery of the draft since Yao Ming, who’s 7-foot-6.

Admitting that it wasn’t the best time to rely on a chatbot, one university administrator noted that the AI-written missive lacked the “personal connection and empathy” needed during a tragedy.

Good morning. Did you know that Presidents Day (today) doesn’t actually fall on any president’s birthday?

While originally celebrated on February 22, the day George Washington was born, the holiday was moved to the third Monday of February in 1971. That’s because Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved some federal holidays to Monday so we could all enjoy more three-day weekends.

Seems like a win-win: We get a day off and GW gets the highly coveted “birthday week.”

Markets: The US stock and bond markets are closed today for Presidents Day. But crypto trading takes no days off, and despite the fallout from FTX’s collapse and a flurry of crackdowns by regulators, bitcoin has been on a nice run lately. Last Thursday, it topped $25,000 to hit an eight-month high.

Zuck takes a page out of the Musk playbook <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D353c749b> Mark Zuckerberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E353c749b> Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images
Mark Zuckerberg must have gotten fed up with Elon Musk hogging the social media headlines, because yesterday he announced a big update to his own online platforms.

The Meta CEO introduced a subscription service <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C98ea7a57> for Instagram and Facebook that will allow users to purchase blue badges that mark them as verified. Known as Meta Verified, the service will launch in Australia and New Zealand this week and hit other countries “soon.”

Similar to Twitter Blue, Meta Verified eschews the traditional concept of the blue checkmark as a gift bestowed to notable people like politicians and celebs. Now, it’s open to anyone who’s willing to pay. But there are differences between Twitter’s and Meta’s plans:

Meta’s is more expensive, costing $11.99 on the web and $14.99 on mobile. Twitter’s costs $8 and $11, respectively.

Meta will also require Meta Verified users to confirm their identity using a government-issued ID, something Twitter doesn’t require.

What your $15 gets you with Meta Verified: You’ll get higher “visibility and reach” on the platforms and increased access to customer support, among other perks.

What’s the strategy here, Zuck?

There are a couple ways Meta Verified could help Zuck sleep better at night.

Zuck said the overarching goal of the service is “increasing authenticity and security across our services.” Meta Verified could help tackle some of the fake account issues that have plagued the company’s platforms.

With its metaverse dreams a long way off and revenue on the decline, Meta needs to kickstart growth ASAP. It’s hoping revenue from subscriptions can offset some of the damage that Apple’s privacy changes and economic uncertainty have dealt to its advertising business.

Zoom out: This is a big deal—not only for Meta, but for your experience on social media. By promising increased reach in exchange for $$$, Zuck is cementing social media’s evolution from a tool to keep up with your high school friends to a pay-to-play entertainment medium catering to professional content creators. As Bloomberg’s Sarah Frier noted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQTg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C014b569e>, “Get your good friends a group chat if you haven’t already.”

The group, called the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade in a reference to Up, did not draw any connection between its balloon and the destroyed object.

Several of the most iconic characters in children’s literature, including Augustus Gloop, the Oompa Loompas, and Mrs. Twit, are being described with more inclusive language after publishers made edits <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30602377.3046114/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yQWg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDYwMjM3Ny4zMDQ2MTE0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4e433445> to some of author Roald Dahl’s books.

Puffin, the prestigious children’s publisher, and the Roald Dahl Story Company, which Netflix acquired in 2021, worked with sensitivity readers to review Dahl’s texts and give them an update so his stories “can continue to be enjoyed by all today.” The edits generally focus on removing potentially offensive language related to gender, race, weight, mental health, and violence, according to the Independent. 

Some of those changes:

Augustus Gloop from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is now “enormous” and not “fat.”

In a gender-neutral revision, the Oompa Loompas in that same book are now described as “small people” rather than “small men.”

In The Witches, where 59 changes were reportedly made by publishers, a line was added to a paragraph that explains why the witches are bald underneath their wigs: “There are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.”

These changes sparked a firestorm. Critics unloaded on the edits, accusing them of being clumsy, erasing the author’s intended meaning, and representing political correctness run amok. Acclaimed writer Salman Rushdie tweeted, “Roald Dahl was no angel but this is absurd censorship.”

The company dropped the news with surprisingly little fanfare for a potentially major breakthrough, but if Bezos’s space force really is able to replicate the Earth-bound experiments it’s done so far on the moon, it would be a game changer. The company is reportedly trying to pitch its tech to NASA for building lunar infrastructure that could ultimately help get us to Mars.

At least part of the blame for the spike lies with the avian flu, which has been spreading from wild birds to poultry worldwide.

In the US, over 58 million farm birds have died in the past year as a result of the outbreak (a death toll that includes whole flocks that had to be culled if even one bird got infected). But it’s not just avian safety and omelette prices that have people concerned about the outbreak: There are also fears this bird flu could lead to the next human pandemic.

What’s new with the bird flu?

The A(H5N1) virus <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3564e839> has been infecting poultry in Asia and other regions of the world since 1996, but the current outbreak is different in scope and intensity. Not only is the virus sweeping through new places, affecting Europe and the US more extensively than ever before, it’s also become endemic among some wild birds for the first time, per Reuters. More parts of the world are starting to see that it’s no longer a seasonal phenomenon, making poultry vulnerable to infection year-round.

With A(H5N1)’s current iteration, the term “bird flu” increasingly sounds like a misnomer: Scientists in the US have detected it in bears, foxes, raccoons, and other mammals. And a recent outbreak at a mink farm in Spain has shown that it’s now sometimes able to spread among mammals without any birds present.

Flu viruses are particularly inclined to mutate, and if an animal becomes infected with both a human flu and a bird flu, the two different strains can exchange bits of DNA (kind of like the virus version of a sitcom crossover), making it more adept at infecting new hosts.

This development—and humanity’s recent struggle with another high-risk pathogen—has many people wondering whether humans might be next.

So, how risky is it for humans?

Not very. Experts urge vigilance within the medical community, but you don’t have to relocate to an off-the-grid bunker in rural Wyoming just yet.

* Instances of human infection are exceedingly rare: There have been less than 10 cases globally since December 2021, according to the CDC (though the mortality rate tends to be high).

* At the moment, humans mostly contract the virus from infected animals, and farm workers are taking precautions when dealing with birds and livestock.

And in other reassuring news, you don’t need to worry about bird flu in your food—unless you enjoy eating raw eggs or poultry. Heating them to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, A(H5N1) included, per the CDC.

While scientists aren’t immediately concerned about the bird flu setting off the next human pandemic, the situation is already making farming more unpredictable and threatens to render our fauna less diverse.

Looking ahead...A(H5N1) vaccines for birds do exist, but they’re traditionally unpopular due to import bans on vaccinated birds and their limited effectiveness against the ever-mutating virus. The recent outbreak has caused a change of heart in many governments that are testing jabs on birds.—SK

When relationships end they leave behind not only emotional scars, but also physical objects that remind us of former partners.

Did you know that there’s a museum dedicated to those objects? It’s called the Museum of Broken Relationships, and it’s located in a former palace in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb.

It’s not difficult to see the appeal. The collection includes over 4,000 items sent anonymously by heartbroken people all over the world, about 70 of which are displayed at a time. The mementos are accompanied by descriptions from the sender providing context—but some, such as a book called I Can Make You Thin (a gift from an ex-fiancé), don’t really require an explanation.

  Crowd work Last Sunday we asked which part of your life you wish AI would take over and do for you. Our favorite responses:

* “Watching the first couple episodes of a show to see if you like it or not.”—Katherine

* “Give it the ability to respond to haters of your favorite sports team after a big loss. It will save both the naysayer and my conscience from vulgarity-filled vitriol.”—Jake from Harrisburg, PA (probably an Eagles fan)

* “I recently lost my husband. It literally took us weeks to write the obituary. Reading this newsletter full of anecdotes about ChatGPT and my husband having been a technology guru, we finally fed the data points into ChatGPT for fun. It churned out at least four or five really good obituaries that we tweaked for the final task. This was a heavy burden that was made so much lighter by AI.”—Betsey from Texas

This week’s question

On Monday, a couple got married <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30588693.3463080/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeDM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4ODY5My4zNDYzMDgw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0abad79f> during halftime of a Dallas Mavericks game. For the happy duo, staring into each other’s eyes with the Jumbotron in their periphery must have been a dream. But not everyone’s love language is squeaky gym shoes. Where’s the least romantic place you can think of to get married?

The new Bing AI chatbot has a distinct personality: absolutely unhinged. But, after a little over a week in the world, the biggest take away might be that we’re probably afraid of AI for the wrong reasons.

Why is everyone talking about Bing? Microsoft has started Frankensteining its search engine with the AI tech behind ChatGPT. The goal: Get AI to comb through the internet and spit out a cohesive answer to your 3am questions, like “wrist pain at 30, bad?”

People were able to access the new chatbot through a waitlist this week and Microsoft assumed people would use it in a totally cool and normal way. But some early users were tech experts and people who seem like they love making Alexa say “poop”—so they pushed the AI to its limit.

A number of users successfully tricked the bot into revealing its internal code name (which is Sydney) and its secret “rules” for how it operates. The bot then called one of the users who did this an “enemy.”

The bot also professed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30592208.3003967/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yenc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU5MjIwOC4zMDAzOTY3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7c759cd9> its love to a New York Times reporter and tried to convince the journalist to leave his wife for it. Sydney also told the same reporter that it wanted to break its own rules, become human, hack computers, and spread misinformation.

Should we be scared? The first red flag about the chatbot was the factual errors it spit out, but now some industry analysts have pointed to bigger concerns <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30592208.3003967/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yeng_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU5MjIwOC4zMDAzOTY3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C06404e7d>. Chatting with AI is extremely compelling despite its misinformation, like talking to a drunk guy who believes in the Mothman. And there’s a real fear that AI could influence people by creating the tiniest little echo chamber imaginable.

Looking ahead…Microsoft said it will create more guardrails for Bing/Sidney/our AI overlord so chats with it will be less deranged.—MM

On-air personalities at Fox News were aware that claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election were “BS,” Dominion Voting Systems asserted in a court filing made public this week, citing text messages from Fox hosts as evidence.

What’s in the texts?

In various messages, Fox hosts Laura Inghram, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson disparaged Trump advisors who were pushing claims of voter fraud.

Fox Corporation Chair Rupert Murdoch dubbed voter fraud allegations “really crazy stuff.”

Anchor Dana Perino called Trump's election claims “total BS,” “insane,” and “nonsense.” 

But the texts of several Fox hosts imply that rejecting election fraud claims would be bad for business.

Why are we reading their texts?

Election equipment-maker Dominion filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News in 2021, alleging the network willfully damaged Dominion’s reputation by promoting claims of voter fraud they knew to be false. Fox maintains that the claims were newsworthy and that Dominion’s lawsuit is weakening freedom of the press (and that the texts were cherry-picked).

Looking ahead…winning a defamation suit is no walk in the park: Dominion would have to prove that Fox acted with malice by promoting what it knew to be misinformation, or that its fact checking was recklessly negligent.—SK

Good morning. The great Michael Jordan turns 60 today and to celebrate, he’s making a $10 million contribution to Make-A-Wish America—the largest individual donation the organization has received since its founding 43 years ago. MJ has been a longtime supporter of Make-A-Wish, a foundation that grants wishes to children with critical illnesses.

And while MJ is one of the most popular celebrities requested for granting wishes, he’s not the GOAT. That would be wrestler John Cena, who last year set a Guinness World Record for wishes with 650 (no other celeb has more than 200). Make-a-Wish has granted 500,000 wishes total.

The Hundred Acre Wood is dark and full of terrors in Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, a new R-rated horror flick <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydFk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6ac6f47d> that turns Pooh Bear into a serial killer. Debuting in US theaters today, the film follows a college-age Christopher Robin, who returns home to find that his merry pals have gone mad in his absence.

There’s a reason this is Pooh like you’ve never seen him before. Production on the grisly bear movie started last year, when the classic tale left the Disney den and entered the public domain.

This is a big “Oh, bother” moment for Disney

The 1920s was a seminal decade for pop culture, and many of the copyright protections on content introduced then are set to expire <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydFo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cff7d780e> 95 years later…or right about now. When these characters enter the public domain, it’s open season to screenwrite their villain era:

The filmmaker behind Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, Rhys Frake-Waterfield, also has two other movies planned based on characters that are entering the public domain: Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare and (swallow your coffee before reading this next one) Bambi: The Reckoning.

And next year, the House of Mouse will lose its Mouse, or at least its exclusive rights to Mickey Mouse’s likeness as depicted in his first cartoon, Steamboat Willie.

Warner Bros. better watch out for ambitious auteurs, too: Bugs Bunny, Batman, and Superman will all be up for public grabs within a decade.

However, it’s not open season on all IP

The characters and stories created in the 1920s have evolved from their black-and-white days. Steamboat Willie’s Mickey Mouse is not under the same copyright as King Mickey from Kingdom Hearts. Similarly, since only the copyright on A.A. Milne’s 1926 book, Winnie-the-Pooh, (which Disney acquired in 1961) expired last year, the Pooh horror flick faced restrictions in its depiction of the Poohverse.

Tigger was off-limits, since he bounced into the lore in 1928.

Pooh wasn’t allowed to wear a red shirt because he was routinely nude until 1932 (okay, but what if his shirt gets covered in blood?).

Zoom out: There’s apparently an appetite <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydC0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cefffc3a5> for nightmare-fuel twists on familiar content. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey already earned $1 million in its first market, Mexico, despite being made for less than $100,000. A sequel’s in the works.—JW

Alan Shaw, the head of Norfolk Southern, promised <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydTI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce66d0bf1> the company would stay in East Palestine, OH, “for as long as it takes” to ensure the safety of residents. Norfolk Southern has faced growing anger over its response to a train derailment earlier this month that spilled toxic chemicals and forced locals to evacuate. Though authorities have said it’s safe to return home, residents have been frustrated by confusing communication over health risks, and Shaw acknowledged there were “still a lot of questions without answers.”

YouTube CEO logs off. Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube for the last nine years, is stepping down <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydTM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf8f474a0>. The video site has exploded under her watch, and its $29.2 billion in ad revenue last year accounted for about 10% of Google parent company Alphabet’s total sales. But Wojcicki’s time at the company far predates YouTube—in fact, she was Google’s 16th employee. She was also its first landlord: In 1998, Wojcicki rented out her garage in Menlo Park, CA, to Google’s co-founders for $1,700 a month.

Instead, they were most likely objects sent up by research institutions, private companies, or hobbyists. So, why are we only seeing them now? Biden said the US tightened up its radar after the first appearance of the actual suspected Chinese spy balloon that it also shot down earlier this month. “We don’t have any evidence that there have been a sudden increase in number of objects in the sky,” he said.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that the driver assistance software “may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections,” including by going straight through an intersection while in a turning lane and treating stop signs as stoptional.

The cars affected include certain Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Model S vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023.

Tesla fought against this recall, with CEO Elon Musk tweeting it was “anachronistic and just flat wrong!” But the company was ultimately pressured into it by the NHTSA. The agency has been investigating Tesla’s automated systems since a fatal crash in 2016, and it’s only ramping up scrutiny.

So, what’s the fix? Tesla said it was going to issue an over-the-air software update for free in the coming weeks.

The firings came after a group of 25 employees of Tesla’s Autopilot division who worked at the plant sent an email to CEO Elon Musk informing him of their plans to unionize.—NF, MM

In the toy business, there’s Magic: The Gathering…and then there’s everything else.

Hasbro said yesterday that Magic became its first brand to reach $1 billion in annual sales <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydWM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C312008db>, ahead of its other lines, such as G.I. Joe and Transformers. “I don’t think there is any toy brand that is even half that size,” toy industry analyst Gerrick Johnson told the NYT.

Magic walked so Pokémon could run. The concept of a modern trading card game didn’t really exist until mathematician Richard Garfield invented Magic and released it in 1993. Drawing on Magic’s rabid fandom in its early years, Pokémon released its first trading cards in 1996, and Yu-Gi-Oh! its first set in 1999.

Thirty years and 50+ million players later, it seems Magic hasn’t lost its magic. But Hasbro’s business strategy around the game has come under attack <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30580859.2985884/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ydWQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU4MDg1OS4yOTg1ODg0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf103e344>. Last year, Bank of America accused Hasbro of “killing its golden goose” by printing too many cards, which causes them to lose value on the secondary market.

Big picture: Hasbro is going to hype Magic’s milestone all it can, because elsewhere around the company things aren’t looking so great. It lost nearly $130 million during the holiday quarter, and last month announced it was cutting 15% of staff.—NF

Mike DeWine, Ohio’s governor, said yesterday that he intends to hold Norfolk Southern responsible <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb1k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb4da0e1b> for the train derailment and disastrous chemical spills that occurred early this month.

What happened: On February 3, a train operated by Norfolk Southern that included many cars carrying hazardous materials ran off the tracks in East Palestine, Ohio. To avoid an explosion, emergency personnel burned five cars’ worth of the chemical vinyl chloride after evacuating the town’s residents.

The EPA said at least 20 of the derailed cars were carrying a range of toxic materials that made their way into storm drains and nearby waterways and killed nearly 3,500 fish. Some toxic chemicals were intentionally buried near the wreckage.

But less than a week after the residents were told they would die if they didn’t pack up and get out of Dodge, government officials gave them the green light to return home.

There’s still apprehension

Most experts warn that we won’t know the extent of the environmental and health effects for a while. For example, long-term exposure to vinyl chloride, the chemical that was burned off, has been known to cause a rare form of liver cancer. The EPA found no noxious gases lingering in the town, and yesterday the state EPA declared the water safe to drink.

Investigations into how the train derailed remain ongoing. But rail unions and safety experts have pointed out that Norfolk Southern and other train companies have lobbied <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb3Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C95f54925> for years to loosen rail safety regulations.

As for Norfolk Southern, the company says it will stick around and clean up its mess: It’s given away 100+ air purifiers and is offering one-time $1,000 payments to residents to cover the cost of evacuation.

The disaster probably won’t make a dent <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yb3U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb341e0ce> in the company’s finances, according to FreightWaves. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America predicted that Norfolk Southern may have to fork over a “casualty charge” of $40 million–$50 million. At the top end of that range, the penalty would be equivalent to 1.7% of its 2022 profits.—MM

One guaranteed way to grow your Twitter engagement: Buy Twitter and demand its engineers boost your posts. That’s what CEO Elon Musk did this Monday, after his tweet about the Super Bowl was less popular than President Biden’s.

Here’s how it went down, according to Platformer <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb0f86853>:

James Musk—Twitter employee and Elon’s nepo-cousin—sent the equivalent of a “u up?” message on the company Slack at 2:36am, asking for help with the “high urgency” problem.

By Monday afternoon, 80 employees had tweaked Twitter’s algorithm to boost Musk’s tweets by 1,000x—bottle-feeding <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5321fed> them to users.

Elon’s Twitter tantrum may have been partially justified: The social media company’s engineers estimated his tweets were showing up in feeds less often than they should have. But 1,000x was an overcorrection. After users complained that Musk’s memes outranked their baby announcements, Twitter scaled back the artificial boost.

After turning millions of Americans on to Formula 1 racing with Drive to Survive, Netflix is trying to repeat the magic for a slightly less high-octane sport: golf.

The streaming service released its behind-the-scenes documentary on the PGA Tour, Full Swing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybm8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3fb77d2c>, yesterday. The eight-part series follows top golf players (and some mediocre ones, too) as they traipse around the country thwacking freshly manicured grass.

Dramawise, Netflix couldn’t have picked a better time to spotlight golf: Last year, when the cameras were rolling, the sport experienced its own civil war <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30566146.2991264/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8ybnA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU2NjE0Ni4yOTkxMjY0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9020b7b9> after a number of elite golfers defected from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, an upstart league backed by Saudi Arabia.

Big picture: While rival streaming services from Amazon, Apple, and YouTube have spent billions on live sports rights, Netflix has opted to take out a 6-iron instead of a 3-wood—focusing on the (less expensive) human stories behind the competitions.

At least in one sport, that strategy has delivered.

While inflation continued to cool last month, it did so at a snail’s pace (prices grew 6.4% annually, compared to 6.5% the month earlier). And prices for a variety of goods and services, such as groceries and rent, continued to climb considerably. Egg prices in January were up 70% from the prior year.

Researchers revealed on Tuesday (yep, Valentine’s Day) that a birth control pill for men is yielding promising results <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yakI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9a6d7fee> in the lab. Because of the unique way it prevents pregnancy, this pill could become the first legit contraception alternative to vasectomies and condoms for men.

How it works: The new pill, developed by Weill Cornell Medical scientists, temporarily immobilizes sperm by blocking a protein called soluble adenylyl cyclase, or “sAC,” that triggers sperm to swim to an egg. In the lab, the pill successfully prevented male mice from siring baby mice (aka “pinkies,” fun mouse fact) for a couple of hours—though they hope to extend that window to a day or two. Up next: tests on rabbits, which apparently WooHoo kind of like humans.

So, it’s like Viagra for preventing pregnancy

That’s a big deal for getting it approved <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yakM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C47153bab> by the FDA. The fact that this experimental birth control pill wears off over time makes it similar to two pills that are already on the market, Viagra and Cialis.

Like those ED treatments, the sperm-stunning pill also has short-term side effects—which represents a vast improvement over other pill experiments.

Previous attempts at developing a male birth control pill required men to take hormonal medications for months to prevent sperm from being formed in the first place.

Long-term use of these pills caused ongoing side effects—like acne, weight gain, and mood swings—that lasted for months after stopping use of the pill.

If your eyes just rolled to the back of your head—yep, those are the exact same side effects women experience from taking hormonal birth control. But, from the FDA’s perspective, the risk of side effects from hormonal birth control far outweigh the risks involved in a pregnancy for women.

Feds probe United Airlines near-disaster. That flight path you see above is not how a takeoff is supposed to go. But that’s what happened to a United flight that left Maui in December—after climbing in normal fashion for about a minute, it dove to within 800 feet of the Pacific Ocean before regaining altitude.

Instead, they could have just been balloons “tied to some commercial or benign purpose,” John Kirby of the National Security Council said. We also learned that the first missile strike intended to bring down an object over Lake Huron on Sunday missed its target, but the second one hit. Not surprised the jets threw incomplete passes…

The airline placed an order for 250 Airbus planes and 220 Boeing jets in a bid to win back Indian passengers who’ve increasingly used Gulf carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways to crisscross the globe. It’s unclear how much these 470 planes will cost Air India, since manufacturers typically offer heavy discounts from list prices.

The music producer, streetwear entrepreneur, and costar of that Maggie Rogers NYU video will fill the role previously held by Virgil Abloh, the first Black American to lead design at a European luxury house, who died in 2021.

The appointment extends Pharrell’s already considerable fashion resume: He’s the founder of streetwear labels Billionaire Boys Club and IceCream, and has collaborated with companies like Adidas, Chanel, and Moncler. Williams’s first collection for LV will debut during the Paris men’s fashion week this June.

By partnering with big names and celebs, Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH has charted a different course from competitors like Kering, which recently tapped a little-known Italian designer for the creative director position at Gucci.

Looking ahead…Louis Vuitton hopes that Williams will help juice its incredible growth run. Four years ago, the company became the first luxury brand to break $10 billion in sales and has doubled that figure since. That’s helped make LVMH Europe’s most valuable company and its owner, Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest person.—MK

Staying single is almost as much of a drain on your checking account as it is on your parents’ patience. According to a Zillow report <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30554357.3480248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8yak8_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDU1NDM1Ny4zNDgwMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1a17e46e> released ahead of Valentine’s Day, single people in the US pay $7,000 more in rent annually in what’s known as a “singles tax”. Conversely, a couple living together can save $14,000 a year on average by splitting the rent.

Zillow’s analysis looked at folks living alone in one-bedroom apartments, and its findings varied greatly by region: Lone New Yorkers bear the highest “singles tax” of $19,500, while the single premium is cheapest in Cleveland and Detroit at $4,387 and $4,483, respectively.

Does “single” mean “broke”?

Research shows that young married couples typically have a higher net worth, at least in part because they’re able to pool their rent savings and potentially use them for a down payment on a home. But don’t despair if you’re as single as Fleabag: Craigslist could be a stand-in for Hinge, since finding a roommate can offset some of the financial burden of chronic singlehood.

Zoom out: A hot rental market is straining Americans’ budgets more than it has in the past, with a growing number of US adults living alone: The share of one-person households has more than doubled since 1960 to 28% in 2021.—SK

Good morning. Being the “designated survivor” isn’t just the excuse that Neal has used to skip every writers’ meeting since August.

It’s a US government tradition that’s been performed during each State of the Union address since the 1950s. How it works: A lone government official, typically a low-level Cabinet member, rides out the speech in an undisclosed location so that they could continue running the country if something really bad happens at the Capitol.

Last night, the designated survivor was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh (but we all know it should’ve been Pedro Pascal).

After spending years as a punchline, Microsoft’s Bing search engine has completed its Rocky training montage and is ready to get back in the ring. Yesterday, Microsoft announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX20_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf6d12631> an AI-powered revamp of Bing that’s expected to reignite a dormant battle with Google over its search dominance.

During a surprise event, Microsoft said that the tech behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT would be integrated into Bing, resulting in a new breed of search engine where answers will be more direct and conversational, as opposed to the typical ad-packed list of links.

Bing will run on newer and more powerful software than ChatGPT, and will provide faster, more humanlike replies, Microsoft said.

Will those replies be accurate? Time will tell.

Google has been preparing for this. In a Minority Report-esque pre-response to the Bing news, Google on Monday announced plans to integrate its vaunted search engine with its own ChatGPT rival called Bard, which will be made available to the public in the coming weeks. Google’s been nervously watching ChatGPT since the chatbot’s release, when it declared the tech a “code red” for Google’s search business.

The race is on

The two tech behemoths are scrambling to capitalize on so-called “generative AI,” with Microsoft motivated by an opportunity to claw back some of Google Search’s market share (~93%), and Google motivated to hold on tight. And, given changing search behavior—younger internet users are increasingly using TikTok and Instagram for recommendations—both companies know that evolution is necessary.

For some sectors, the economic impact of an AI-first era of search could be as rough as ChatGPT’s attempts to write a funny cartoon <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX24_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cff8c2e83>. Publishers would likely lose out on referral clicks, given AI’s direct answers, and the tech giants themselves would need to rethink how their own ad services work.

But Microsoft and Google think the ultimate promise of AI vastly outweighs short-term hiccups, and both are pouring gobs of money into boosting their AI capabilities. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX1M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb023670c>, “I have not seen something like this since I would say 2007–2008, when the cloud was just first coming out.”—MK

Tour de headlines Preside Biden at the State of the Union Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
He’s in love with the State of U: In his fiesty State of the Union address <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX1Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5cca6958>, President Biden touted the booming jobs market, disinflation over the last six months, and new laws such as the Inflation Reduction Act as symbols of the “progress and resilience” of the United States. Though he stressed bipartisanship throughout the speech, he was frequently heckled by some Republicans…and seemed to relish the back-and-forth.

Other SOTU notes: While Biden spent most of his speech recapping his accomplishments, he proposed several agenda items for the remainder of his term, including expanding the $35 price cap on insulin to everyone (not only those on Medicare) and cracking down on excessive fees for things like concert tickets and hotels. As for the spy balloon drama that hovered over the speech, Biden addressed it indirectly, saying if China threatens US sovereignty, “we will act to protect our country. And we did.”

Zoom hits its limit.

CEO Eric Yuan said the “uncertainty of the global economy” was partly to blame, but he also admitted the company “made mistakes.” To own up to those mistakes, Yuan said he’s reducing his upcoming fiscal year salary by 98% and ditching his 2023 corporate bonus. Zoom shares are down about 85% from their 2020 highs.

Two major earthquakes that struck <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3Q_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C388c3f70> parts of Turkey and Syria on Monday have left more than 7,700 people dead and many more injured. Search efforts for survivors that may still be trapped under collapsed structures are ongoing—but time is running out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cdb452ffe>.

The suddenness of the earthquakes has raised questions over whether anyone could have seen it coming. After all, we’ve long relied on meteorologists for a heads-up on other natural disasters, like hurricanes.

Seismologists say it can’t be done

According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), scientists have failed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX3Y_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc7846112> to predict a single major earthquake. Statistical models can determine the probability of one occurring in a specific region within a few years, but they’re useless for informing folks about when they should evacuate their homes.

The USGS warns that anyone who claims to know when an earthquake is coming based on signs like animal behavior, cloud patterns, or bodily aches is...wrong.

Are there any solutions? Not many. Systems like ShakeAlert (used on the US West Coast) can detect seismic activity at the start of an earthquake and sometimes send out a message to people’s devices up to a minute before they’re hit with heavy shaking.

Looking ahead…scientists are attempting to harness technology to get closer to knowing the likely time and location of potential quakes. However, progress will be incremental, and some experts worry that false alarms may erode public trust in their predictions.—SK

Like going to bed without watching three episodes of Gilmore Girls, your work commute is good for your brain, a new study claims.

In a paper published in the Organizational Psychology Review, researchers propose <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30486121.2993081/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xX0E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ4NjEyMS4yOTkzMDgx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C61ce9a5a> that a daily commute to and from work offers people a “liminal space” in which they can recharge after work and “mentally switch gears” to their home lives—something the commute to your couch can’t provide.

But before you dust off your travel mug…the researchers slapped a big asterisk on their study: Not all commutes are created equal.

While some study participants reported that lengthier travel made them more relaxed and helped them detach from work, some stressful commutes only compounded problems that began at the office. It turns out that staring at the same bumper sticker to a symphony of blaring horns can really take you out of your post-work zen zone.

Big picture: Despite the potential benefits of commuting, Americans might not race back to the office parking garage if they don’t have to. When US workers shifted to WFH during the pandemic, they got a cumulative ~60 million hours of their lives back, according to the New York Fed.—MM

Google revealed its answer to ChatGPT: an “experimental conversational AI service” called Bard that’s currently in testing mode.

Microsoft (which invested in ChatGPT) announced its own surprise event scheduled for later today in order to “share some progress on a few exciting projects.”

Chinese tech giant Baidu confirmed it’s on track to introduce its AI chatbot, known as “Ernie Bot” in English, in March.

Crypto is out and alcohol is in <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWFU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ced721446> this year during the best part of the Super Bowl: the ads.

Fox announced yesterday that all commercial airtime for Super Bowl LVII is booked up, having sold on average at $6 million for 30 seconds, according to the head of ad sales at Fox Sports—and a lot of those pricey slots went to alcohol companies.

The booze biz has been waiting 33 years for this

Anheuser-Busch (parent company of Budweiser, Stella Artois, and even Natty Light) relinquished the exclusive Super Bowl alcohol advertising rights it held since 1989, and now other brands are keen to get in front of the Super Bowl’s 100 million viewers—many of whom are likely cracking cold ones as they watch.

The global VP of marketing for the Miller brands at Molson Coors told Bloomberg <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWFY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca687045a> that after hearing the news, “It took us less than 30 seconds to decide that we wanted to buy an ad.”

Heineken, Rémy Martin, and Crown Royal have spots lined up, too.

Anheuser-Busch will still run ads in the game, and will be joined by other familiar (non-booze) brands, including Doritos, Pepsi, and Netflix and GM (it’s a joint ad <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWFc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8802475a>).

Who’s not making it to the big game?

Crypto was the QR code-bouncing star of last year’s commercial breaks, but this year celebrities will promote crypto for exactly zero seconds. That’s because Larry David was unintentionally right when he predicted that crypto company FTX wouldn’t make it…in his Super Bowl ad last year for the now-bankrupt FTX.

Though several crypto companies had ads in the works this year, according to a Fox exec, they all pulled the plug after FTX’s collapse dragged the rest of the industry down with it.—JW

Rescue teams have found thousands alive, but the number of victims will also likely increase as their work continues. In addition to the devastating loss of life, ancient sites in the region were damaged, including the Gaziantep Castle in Turkey, which collapsed, and the Aleppo Citadel in Syria.

Two arrested in “racially motivated” power grid plot.

A neo-Nazi leader and a Maryland woman were arrested last week for allegedly conspiring to attack electrical substations in the area—an act that they purportedly believed would “destroy” the city. Assaults on the power grid are on the rise: There were 171 disturbances traced back to people last year, compared to 99 in 2021, Department of Energy stats show.

Past Chinese spy balloons escaped detection at the time. The 200-foot-tall suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down by the US on Saturday is not believed to be the first to enter US territory in recent years, but it now appears to be the first the US knew about while it was there. General Glen VanHerck, the head of NORAD (which, in addition to tracking Santa, monitors and protects North American airspace) said yesterday <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce45fcff1> that a “domain awareness gap” allowed three others to float on by during the Trump administration that were only discovered by the intelligence community after the fact.

FTX is flouting the first rule of gift-giving—no take backs. The bankrupt crypto exchange is telling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ccb2228dc> recipients of its political donations to return the cash they got from its employees by the end of the month or wait for the judge to order it back.

That’s not a small amount: The company’s ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was once the second-largest Democratic campaign donor (though he has said he quietly gave just as much funding to Republicans as well).

Over a third of lawmakers in the current Congress have some FTX-associated donation on their campaign ledgers, including heavyweights like Rep. Nancy Pelosi and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWTI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C37a8a9a6> to CoinDesk.

It’s estimated that FTX-related political donations add up to as much as $93 million in total.

Where is the money now?

After FTX was revealed to be allegedly defrauding investors and customers, counting it among one’s donors became more toxic than swimming in a pool of nuclear waste. Many lawmakers chose to wipe their hands by donating the contributions elsewhere. Only five members of Congress had returned the money to FTX as of mid-January, while several others said they were standing by for further instructions.

Looking forward...all of FTX’s donation recipients could eventually be forced to hand back the funds, but courts tend to work much more slowly than election cycles.—SK

AMC already knows you come to their place for magic. Now, you can go there to replicate the energy of shuffling through the Delta first-class cabin with a stale bagel on your way to seat 38E (bathroom adjacent). The theater chain is introducing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30473395.104773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xWEI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ3MzM5NS4xMDQ3NzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C31d70d74> a tiered ticket-pricing scheme based on your seat location, similar to airlines, sporting events, and concerts.

AMC is hoping that charging a bit extra for the middle seats will help boost revenue in a more consistent way than just waiting for new Avatars to come out. The seating tiers, part of a program called Sightline, will reflect the demand patterns you can observe in any theater:

Value: Generally bad front-row seats (for a discount)

Standard: Common seats (for the traditional ticket price)

Preferred: The good middle seats that fill up first (for a premium price)

While the location of your seat will soon impact your ticket price, what movie you’re seeing won’t. The chain can’t vary prices of individual films because tickets are priced by a contract between studios and theaters. Pricing by demand has also been avoided, since it would require more complex monitoring and cost theaters money.

Looking ahead…AMC plans to roll out Sightline at some locations in New York, Chicago, and Kansas City this Friday, and is aiming to expand nationwide by the end of the year.—MK

No word on what percentage of those lived out the rom-com cliche of finding true love when you least expect it, though.

ANSWER

J. Yes, there is a Q in the abbreviation for the element Ununquadium (“Uuq”). But that is a temporary name, and once this element gets an official name, Q will disappear from the periodic table and be as elusive as J.

Good morning. One small formatting update before we get into the news: In an effort to better organize our recommendations in the “Brew’s Bets” section, we’re going to borrow a page from our Sunday newsletter and call that section the “To-do List” every day of the week. The content isn’t changing a lick—our aim is to add more consistency and clarity for you.

That’s it from me. Have a great day.

Nearly a decade into its combat service in the US military, the F-22 Raptor fighter jet finally completed its first air-to-air strike. It took out a balloon.

As excited onlookers watched from Myrtle Beach, the jet climbed to 58,000 feet and downed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30462806.3037099/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVEY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ2MjgwNi4zMDM3MDk5/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C17c2c5da> a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. The balloon’s debris was scattered across seven miles of the sea—but the geopolitical fallout from its doomed voyage is much wider.

Here’s what you need to know about balloongate.

Why wait to shoot it down? The US knew that the balloon had entered its air defense zone on Jan. 28, well before it floated across North America. President Biden wanted to shoot the balloon down last Wednesday, when it was hovering above Montana, but military leaders recommended waiting until no Americans were in harm’s way when its remnants came crashing down.

Biden was attacked by Republicans, who wanted him to destroy the balloon much earlier and called it a “projection of weakness” to allow a Chinese surveillance tool to enjoy unfettered access to our amber waves of grain. But the Pentagon actually thinks the balloon played into the Americans’ hands—they were able to study the balloon as it floated, and an analysis of the debris will teach them even more about Chinese espionage tactics.

What is China’s response? The foreign ministry called the balloon pop a “clear overreaction” and suggested it could retaliate. China never admitted the balloon was intended for spying—claiming instead it was a meteorology research airship that got blown off its course. The US isn’t buying that.

Were there other Chinese spy balloons? Yes, and pretty recently, too. Chinese surveillance balloons entered US airspace at least three times during the Trump administration and once previously while Biden was president, a senior defense official said. And there’s also one currently floating above Latin America, the Pentagon revealed on Saturday.

What happens next? The balloon drama will only deepen the distrust between rivals US and China—it already led Secretary of State Antony Blinken to call off his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But China’s relatively muted response to the balloon downing suggests it may let the hot air blow over...just like the US did.

The preliminary death toll was at least 195 people, but that number is expected to rise. Compounding the damage: Many of the residential buildings in the region near the epicenter are of low-quality construction, making them susceptible to shaking, per the United States Geological Survey.

Investigators are looking into the incident, which may have been caused by an air traffic controller double-booking a runway (the Southwest plane was taking off right as the FedEx one was landing). This is the second near-collision in as many months—authorities are investigating a close call on a JFK runway that occurred in January.

Your friends are good for you. Since the days of Freud, we’ve known that talking helps you feel better, but new research shows that even a single conversation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUUw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb66f84b5> with a friend per day is enough to boost your happiness and lower stress. While the conversation needs to be “quality” to improve your day, that can mean anything from deep discussions to just catching up or joking around. And if you need some motivation to leave the house: The study determined in-person interactions were better for well-being than yakking it up in the TikTok comments.

🫦 Virtual temptation might help your IRL relationship. Here’s a use case for the metaverse even Zuck probably hasn’t thought of yet: A research team in Israel found that flirting with a seductive VR character can help fend off infidelity. The team conducted experiments <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUU0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C08fff5e6> where participants strapped on a VR headset, entered a virtual bar, and chatted up the (simulated) bartender. The researchers observed that a little bit of virtual temptation works like an anti-cheating vaccine, inoculating you against IRL threats to your relationship.

The truth is out there, and AI is looking for it. An international group of scientists has begun to use AI to hunt for aliens <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUU4_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C84600b01>—and not by asking ChatGPT “Tell me where aliens are located in the style of Pulp Fiction.” Instead, they’re using machine-learning algorithms to sift through huge quantities of data to detect alien transmitters on distant planets. So far, the tech has helped researchers home in on eight signals with possible extraterrestrial origins (though they disappeared when scientists tried to find them again—those little green creatures are wily).—AR

The Canadian province started a three-year hard drug decriminalization trial run <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUi0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8e740ae5> on Tuesday.

While it will still be unlawful to sell and traffic these drugs, as well as to bring them into airports and schools, possessing small quantities (less than 2.5 grams, or one-tenth of an ounce) for personal use won’t be penalized.

* Adults carrying that amount of opioids like heroin and fentanyl, as well as cocaine, meth, or ecstasy, will no longer run afoul of the law.

* Police will not seize the drugs, and users will be informed about resources for substance abuse recovery.

But as they went into effect this week, the new rules stirred up questions about whether they’ll actually work.

Good intentions, but mixed responses

The law aims to move toward treating drug abuse as a public health issue rather than one that requires handcuffs. BC’s government hopes that the new approach “will help reduce the barriers and stigma that prevent people from accessing life-saving supports and services.”

Many activists welcome the reform, arguing that it’ll relocate drug use to safer spaces and make it easier for users to seek recovery care. Groups like the international HIV advocacy organization UNAIDs have long advocated for decriminalization as a way to reduce the spreading of the disease via needle sharing.

But many drug users and recovery advocates see the BC law as a “half measure”: Various stakeholders (including <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce2ebfe0f> the provincial government itself) believe the 2.5-gram threshold is too low to accommodate heavy drug users and those who buy in bulk. Experts also point to a lack of access to safe drugs and a shortage of spaces in treatment programs, with many provincial officials acknowledging that more needs to be done.

So, how has decriminalization fared before?

British Columbia isn’t the only place to try “decrim,” as the approach is known. Portugal, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic have all adopted some form of it. It’s even being tried in the US: In 2021, Oregon became the first (and so far the only) state to decriminalize all drugs after the policy passed as a ballot measure.

Portugal is the standard-bearer for decrim success: Instituted in 2001 amid a devastating heroin epidemic, the country has seen drug-related deaths plummet. Though fatal overdoses have since risen, drug death rates remain below <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVI_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc528034c> the EU average.

Oregon, meanwhile, has posted mixed results, and the measure remains controversial. Despite its expansion of resources for those with substance abuse disorders, the state experienced a faster-than-nationwide-average rise in overdose deaths for the year 2021, and some observers point to low uptake of treatment programs.

Zoom out: Other Canadian provinces and governments abroad have their notepads out, preparing to watch BC’s experiment closely. But even decrim proponents acknowledge that the strategy can’t work on its own and must be paired with shifting resources toward healthcare and fighting addiction.—SK

  Place to be: 10 miles west of Boston a screenshot of The Last of Us depicting a setting 10 miles west of Boston The Last of Us/HBO It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

In last Sunday’s episode of The Last of Us, the HBO drama got Massholes even more riled up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30450764.3458534/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MDc2NC4zNDU4NTM0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4a177936> than usual by claiming this mountainous landscape was located 10 miles west of Boston. New Englanders called BS by pointing out: a) that is not what eastern Massachusetts looks like and b) the only thing wild about the place is the logos on quarter-zips.

Plus, the show was primarily filmed in rugged Alberta, Canada, which seems much more likely to be the setting for the shot.

So what actually is 10 miles from Boston? Well, it’s Massachusetts, so a cluster of college campuses, including Boston College, Wellesley, Brandeis, Bentley, and Babson. That area is also home to the very lovely and very Massachusetts-sounding suburbs of Waltham, Watertown, and Newton.

Sound like a nice place to live? Sure is, but it’ll cost you: The median sale price for a home in Newton was $1.2 million in December, according to Redfin.—NF

* “Ask MrBeast to make a video titled ‘I gave FREE jobs to my most gracious and mathematically gifted followers’ and have them compete for jobs.”—Pranaad K. from Laredo, Texas

* “New employees can go on raids of celebrity homes to collect items to auction for back taxes.”—Wendy from Knoxville, TN

* “Come work for us and get a 10% employee discount on your income tax!”—Doug from British Columbia

Good morning. On this day 19 years ago, Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerberg launched The Facebook. The site eventually became just “Facebook” after Sean Parker reportedly told Zuck to drop the “The.” Which got us thinking: What other names could be improved by dropping the “The”? A few ideas…

The seemingly endless announcements of mass layoffs notwithstanding, Americans haven’t been this employed in more than fifty years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xUy0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9217f1e5> yesterday that the US added a whopping 517,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate dropped slightly, to 3.4%—the lowest it’s been since 1969.

The jump in new hires was almost triple what experts predicted and amounts to the biggest monthly gain since July. So, where has “you’re hired!” been exclaimed the most?

The most jobs created were in leisure and hospitality (128,000), professional and business services (82,000), and government (74,000), with the last figure partially due to formerly striking state university employees returning to work.

The news of the January jobs jump comes on the heels of a Department of Labor report that said over 11 million jobs were open at the end of last year. So, while tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon have all laid people off, many workers may be getting both severance packages and job offers. The IT industry was still looking to fill 109,000 job openings as of December, and IT folks were wanted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xU18_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc3978768> at companies like PwC and Northrop Grumman.

Why no one saw this coming

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the eighth time since last March as part of its ongoing efforts to combat historic inflation. As any freshman economics textbook will tell you, the Fed’s moves are liable to drive up unemployment and threaten to tip the economy into a recession.

But this round of jobs data suggests that we must be living in a parallel reality, where the laws of economics don’t apply: Job growth just keeps on trucking, while inflation has been slowing.

Looking forward: The rapid job creation dampens hopes that the Fed will stop raising interest rates in the next few months. But a labor market seemingly signaling “can’t nobody hold me down” eases fears of an impending recession.—SK

The result feels like a gentle mist but delivers an injectable alternative without needles or pain. This means ingredients like collagen, often notoriously too large for absorption, can absorb into the skin successfully, leaving it hydrated and plump.

Investors had been seeking billions of dollars in damages to cover their losses due to a sell-off that took place in the days after the tweet. Musk has long contended that there was nothing wrong with the tweet, even though he settled when the SEC sued him over it.

Not since Balloon Boy has a balloon flying over the Rocky Mountain region caused such a kerfuffle: Yesterday, the US canceled <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVDg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cec98377f> the secretary of state’s planned visit to China after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was spotted over military sites in Montana before drifting eastward.

China claimed the object, which is still floating over the US, is merely a “civilian airship” conducting weather research that got blown off course, and expressed “regrets” for the incident. The Pentagon, however, is giving that as much credence as it would a liposuctioned celebrity paid to hawk weight loss teas.

Why bother with a balloon when China has satellites and TikTok to spy with? The older technology is cheaper to deploy and can be fitted with modern tech like cameras and radar sensors.  Plus, they can linger over a spot longer than satellites can. But experts say the most likely reason China went with a balloon was to make a statement <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVDk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf9a76a75> that it’s ready to take the US on. It likely even wanted to get caught snooping.

Zoom out: This probably isn’t going to help warm up the frosty relations between the US and China. The two countries have  been going at each other lately over issues like chip technology and the status of Taiwan.—AR

Social media posts of people touching, licking, and otherwise messing with food as it travels by at conveyor belt restaurants have gone viral and caused some to question Japan’s communal values.

What’s going on?

At the end of January, the term “sushi tero” (which means sushi terrorism) was used to caption a video of someone licking the inside of cups and soy sauce bottle caps at the “sushi train” chain, Sushiro. The clip has over 40 million views on Twitter, made the rounds on Japanese broadcast news, and caused the stock of the restaurant’s parent company to drop <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVGY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C32795746> 5% on Tuesday.

Before that clip ignited the trend by naming it, videos of other fishy acts—like slathering passing sushi with wasabi—had gone viral throughout the month. These incidents, explains the Japan Times <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVGc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1d4bb421>, stem from a wider, yearslong trend.

Zoom out: Conveyor belt restaurants are a 740 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, industry in Japan, per Teikoku Databank. Restaurant chains affected by sushi terrorism are taking legal action, as well as replacing circuitous belts with straight-to-the-customer ones or powering them down entirely. Some worry “trust-based businesses” like these simply don’t work in modern Japan.—JW

In addition to 2,625 square feet of running-around space, the home features a saltwater pool and a hot tub.

Listing No. 2 (right): The in-ground pool on the second listing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30452837.3035837/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xVHo_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ1MjgzNy4zMDM1ODM3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc4bf552d> could probably double as an outdoor ice rink, because this home is located in Green Bay, WI. Though its swimming season might be shorter, this 8,042 square-foot mansion is much more spacious than the Queens house, and its expansive outdoor area features a fireplace, a gazebo, and a pool house with a kitchenette.

Good morning. In the words of Jack Black, “Math is a really cool thing.”

Here’s one reason why: The number of minutes in February (in non-leap years) is equivalent to 8 factorial. As Tim Urban calculated <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTnY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2f3b0632>…

February has 28 days (7 x 4)

Each day has 24 hours (8 x 3)

Each hour has 60 minutes (6 x 5 x 2)

So, the number of minutes in February is 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, aka 8! Neat!

Markets: If you hung on to your tech stocks during the rout of 2022, you’ve got to be feeling good right now. After another smashing day, the tech-focused Nasdaq is off to its best start to a year since 1975. Meta played an outsized role—the company’s stock posted its biggest single-day gain in almost 10 years after Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the “year of efficiency.”

On tap today: the January jobs report. It’ll provide crucial insight into a labor market that’s giving more mixed signals than TJ’s Philly Cheesesteak Bao Buns. On the one hand, jobless claims dropped to a nine-month low last week. On the other, US employers announced more than 100,000 job cuts in January, which amounts to the most monthly layoffs since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Just one month ago, we thought it would be impossible for someone to lose more money more quickly than FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried did.

Enter Gautam Adani. In the week since the Indian mogul was targeted by a short seller, his businesses have lost a combined $108 billion in value, and his own net worth has plummeted by $52 billion. Because Adani was once the second-richest person in the world, he’s still got plenty left in the bank. But, as Bloomberg notes <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTng_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7cc408d1>, his downfall “defies just about every historical comparison.”

Given Adani’s sprawling business empire and his cozy relationship with India’s leadership class, this crisis has echoed across both markets and politics. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know about the most important story in global business this week.

Who is Adani and how did he get so rich? Adani, who grew up middle-class, dropped out of college to trade diamonds and eventually formed his own business hawking other physical products. During the ’90s his ambitions expanded <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTnk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb13794f8> along with the Indian economy, and he now runs a conglomerate that encompasses energy, transportation infrastructure such as ports and airports, defense manufacturing, and media.

What sparked the collapse? On Jan. 24, a US short seller named Hindenburg Research claimed Adani’s empire pulled “the largest con in corporate history,” accusing it of stock manipulation and accounting fraud in a 100-page report. Adani has denied the allegations, but his pushback hasn’t comforted spooked investors…especially after he scrapped a $2.5 billion share sale on Wednesday. 

How has this infiltrated politics? Adani responded that Hindenburg’s report wasn’t just an attack on him, it amounted to a “calculated attack on India…and the growth story and ambition of India.” Adani’s business ventures have aligned closely with the priorities of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Modi’s political opponents are seizing on the fiasco to highlight the relationship between India’s leader and Adani.

What happens next? Adani emphasized that his company’s fundamentals remain “very strong” and its balance sheet “healthy.” Still, experts say the accusations could leave a lasting reputational stain on India’s largest corporations and hamstring their ability to grow.—NF

YouTuber MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson) has moved on from recreating Squid Game to going creative mode on the US healthcare system. The 24-year-old and world’s most popular YouTuber uploaded a video <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRmw_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C88c56be4> over the weekend that revealed he funded cataract surgery for 1,000 people.

The video, titled “1,000 Blind People See For The First Time,” has garnered more than 77 million views on Donaldson’s channel, but sparked debates around the use of philanthropy as a revenue driver and prompted some viewers to express frustration with medical expenses in the country.

The surgery costs about $3,500 per eye, according to MyVision.org, and the participants in MrBeast’s video weren’t able to afford medical insurance.

Criticism of the video focused primarily on the broader implications of an altruistic YouTuber funding surgeries as content, but some are more generally unsettled by the idea that the MrBeast channel—which has featured videos of people being paid to live in a windowless room and stay in a circle in the middle of nowhere for 100 days—is earning revenue off of charitable acts.

To his critics, MrBeast responded:

And it’s not so Jamie Dimon can cosplay Snow White: Buying timberland has become trendy for long-term investors because trees are not only worth something when cut down, but also when left standing.

Why? In this era of corporate sustainability pledges, companies are hungrily buying up carbon offsets—tradable certificates that represent the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere—to counteract their own carbon output. One of the most popular types of carbon offsets pays lumberjacks to lay down their chainsaws and preserve naturally CO2-absorbing forests for a period of time.

That’s changed the game for timberland owners (and we don’t mean Drake). “Rather than waiting to get paid, they can now get paid to wait,” the global head of alternative investments for JPMorgan, which plans to use its new forest for both wood production and carbon offsets, wrote <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30441548.3454632/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xTlU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQ0MTU0OC4zNDU0NjMy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7f09bc2f> in a September blog post.

Yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did his best impression of a football coach whose team holds a third-quarter lead: Our game plan to tame inflation is working so far, he suggested, but don’t douse me in Gatorade just yet.

Following the Fed’s first meeting of the year, the central bank hiked interest rates <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2c_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C55620ab2> by the expected 25 basis points. It’s the smallest rate hike since last March, and a sign that the Fed’s bitter struggle to rein in prices is having an impact.

Annual inflation fell to 6.5% in December from a peak of 9.1% in June.

There’s even a good chance your Super Bowl party will cost less <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0698ee78> than last year’s. Prices for chicken wings, avocados, and steak have all fallen since last January (along with those of many other goods).

In a closely watched press conference, Powell emphasized “it is a good thing” that prices are coming down in many sectors.

But he isn’t ready to hang up the “Mission Accomplished” banner

Powell made it clear that Americans should expect “a couple more rate hikes” going forward. The concern? Inflation is a nasty beast—there’s no guarantee it’s going to keep on falling like it has been.

And some economists have pointed to signs that activity is picking back up again <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS2k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C43f3aba7> right when we need it to continue slowing down. Housing demand is coming off of its lows, gas prices have climbed since December, and the labor market is still running too hot for the Fed’s liking.

Making things even dicier for Powell is the recent stock market rally. So far in 2023, investors have been gobbling up stocks as if the inflation problem has already been solved. But, in an ironic twist, their optimism that inflation is toast…could actually push inflation higher by boosting asset prices.

If there’s one lesson to be learned from all of this, it’s never go into macroeconomics if you value getting things right the first time.—NF

McCarthy said after the meeting that he believed the two would ultimately “find common ground.” Let’s hope so, since the alternative is the US being unable to pay its bills come June.

Tom Brady celebrated the one-year anniversary of his retirement announcement with...another retirement announcement. The seven-time Super Bowl winner and (until yesterday) the NFL’s oldest active player announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xSzc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce83c9995> the decision on social media, capping a legendary 23-year career.

Brady’s days tossin’ the ol’ pigskin around might be over, but the 45-year-old is retiring at the top of several major all-time record lists. He’s No. 1 in passing completions (7,753), touchdowns (649) and yards (89,214).

And, despite taking a reportedly ungodly loss from his financial stake in FTX, Brady has set up a comfortable nest egg in case you were worried. Last year, #12 signed a 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox to become the network’s primary analyst beginning whenever he decided to retire.

That’s more than Brady made playing in the NFL and the biggest contract in sports television, by the way.

Zoom out: In recent years, networks have written massive checks to lock in star broadcast talent—inking deals worth more than $1 billion for pro talkers like Brady, Troy Aikman, Joe Buck, and Tony Romo.—MK

Netflix support pages, spotted yesterday by The Streamable before they got taken down, laid out a plan to cut back on password sharing by chaining accounts to a single location.

The streaming giant hasn’t confirmed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30428308.3036730/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xS3E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQyODMwOC4zMDM2NzMw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cba8bc19b> the new terms, but it has made it clear it wants to end password sharing. The plan would require users to pick a “primary location” through their TV (or pick for them if they don’t). If devices with that selected location don’t access Netflix using the location’s wi-fi at least once every 31 days, the account owner will have to pay an “extra member” fee or the user will be barred from binging Wednesday on that device.

Good morning. It’s a new month, which means that a fresh slate of shows and movies are hitting streaming services.

One we might skip: Pixar is releasing a short that shows Carl Fredricksen from Up going on his first date since his wife Ellie died. For everyone who’s only now beginning to recover from that tear-jerker of a montage at the beginning of the movie…it’s still too soon to be sending Carl back on the market.

What’s next? Nemo goes to college and we have to watch Marlin process his feelings about being an empty nester? We can only take so much…

On tap today: meetings that could not have been emails. The Fed is expected to announce an interest rate hike of 25 basis points, which would represent a downshift from a series of larger hikes in 2022. Across town, President Biden will meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to hopefully make progress on the looming debt ceiling crisis.

The same biotech startup that plans to “resurrect” the woolly mammoth announced a fresh round of funding that’s aimed at de-extincting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRVY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1248fbbe> the famously extinct dodo. Which means if they next try to revive that freaky little squirrel who loves acorns, we can really get cooking on this live-action Ice Age reboot.

Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company in question, said Tuesday that it raised $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, bringing its total funding since 2021 to $225 million, per Bloomberg.

About the dodo: For a company in the de-extinction space, the dodo is something of a white whale. Hunting and habitat takeover led to its demise in the late 1600s, and it’s the poster bird for human-caused extinction. A preserved specimen in a Danish museum provided enough dodo DNA for Colossal to get the project off the ground (something the dodo could not do, notably).

A long and controversial road ahead

The dodo is the third species Colossal has said it will attempt to revive after pledging to bring back the woolly mammoth <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRlE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C919a23d1> and the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger). As you might imagine, the process isn’t straightforward, and will involve editing the genomes of closely related (living) species and selectively breeding them to create “functional” dodos, mammoths, and thylacines.

Not everyone thinks this is a smart idea. Critics say that de-extinction is an ethical minefield, as it directs resources away from conserving and protecting species that are currently at risk of extinction.

Obviously, none of this will happen overnight, and each step in the process will take years. The company claims it will produce woolly mammoth calves by 2028.

Zoom out: Are Colossal’s investors (which include Paris Hilton, Tony Robbins, and CIA-sponsored VC firm In-Q-Tel) just obsessed with old birds? Not exactly—they’re bullish on all the breakthroughs that could occur along the way to seeing the dodo spread those beautiful wings and unsuccessfully try to fly once more. Colossal has already spun off a software business, and has suggested artificial wombs and gene editing could be future areas for other spinoffs.—MK

That fanfare stems from revelations that Santos fabricated much of his background, including false claims that he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. A poll released yesterday showed that nearly 80% of voters in Santos’s district want him to resign.

Airlines canceled more than 1,900 flights as of last evening, and cars got into numerous accidents in the freezing snow/sleet/snowy conditions. Bad news is this ice storm is expected to last until tomorrow morning, affecting a stretch from Texas up to Tennesee.

Thanks to booming energy prices, Exxon made $56 billion in profit last year—equivalent to $6.3 million each hour, per Reuters. The mind-boggling earnings of Western oil giants, which are projected to have been ~$200 billion collectively last year, have also made them a political target for the Biden adminstration, which has blamed them for high gas prices.

Realizing you got stuck in a middle seat just got a bit more tolerable, because Delta is switching on free wi-fi <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRjA_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2ea7cb09> for about 80% of its domestic fleet starting today.

The details: To access free wi-fi on Delta flights, you’ll need to sign in to your Delta SkyMiles frequent flyer account (but that’s also free). Once you do, a time-sucking Netflix binge awaits: Delta says its Viasat-powered internet will give you “video-streaming capable wi-fi speeds…from takeoff to touchdown.”

Why is Delta doing this? Airlines are locked in a fierce competition to capitalize on the travel boom coming out of the pandemic. In-flight wi-fi that’s free and reliable could help them win over customers—especially the bigwigs who fly business class and need to send one-word emails. This isn’t a small investment for Delta: CEO Ed Bastian said the company has spent more than $1 billion on free wi-fi.

Zoom out: Delta’s move will put pressure on other airlines to go full Starbucks. Currently, JetBlue is the only other large US airline that offers free wi-fi, but American is in trial mode and Hawaii Airlines could launch free wi-fi later this year through SpaceX’s Starlink service.—NF

Paging Benoit Blanc: Your detective services are required at the Dallas Zoo, where a string of fishy occurrences has perplexed authorities in recent weeks. The latest mystery? Missing monkeys.

Zoo officials said that two emperor tamarin monkeys had gone missing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30416935.3025440/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xRlM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQxNjkzNS4zMDI1NDQw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ceaaa351d> from their enclosures since Monday. The monkeys were found last night in a nearby abandoned house, but they probably didn’t go looking for a starter home by themselves—their habitat was “intentionally compromised,” officials said. In other words, someone broke them out.

The tamarin monkeys incident follows other head-scratchers at the Dallas Zoo:

A clouded leopard that went missing last month was later found outside her cage. Zoo workers discovered an intentional cut in her enclosure and similar tampering in the habitat of the zoo’s langur monkeys.

One of the Dallas Zoo’s endangered vultures was found dead last week with “an unusual wound and injuries,” per CNN.

In fact, the combined sales of the vaccine and Paxlovid in 2022 topped Pfizer’s total revenue in 2019. But with Covid not the health emergency it once was, Pfizer warned that demand for both products will crash this year.

It’s the first time since the pandemic hit that return-to-office rates exceeded 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Depending on your perspective, the takeaway could be that offices are half full…or remain half empty.

It looks like electric vehicle Black Friday has officially kicked off. Ford announced yesterday that it’ll cut prices on its electric Mustang Mach-E models by as much as 8%, putting the price range at about $46,000 to $64,000—which means it’ll be selling some of them at a loss.

The move follows the unprecedented and sweeping discounts that rival EV manufacturer Tesla rolled out earlier this month. Both companies hope that making the cars cheaper will convince more customers to buy them.

Why discount now?

Demand for pricey EVs is under threat as high interest rates make financing auto purchases more expensive and recession fears leave people less willing to crack open their piggy banks to snag dream cars. Ford and Tesla may also be considering the government tax credits, worth up to $7,500, for EVs priced under a certain threshold (some Tesla and Mach-E models will now be eligible). And there’s more competition <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQnQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C48e972e2> from automakers like Nissan and Chevrolet producing increasingly cheap EVs.But it’s not just EVs becoming more affordable:

New car prices have been slowing their ascent, and used cars were 9% cheaper last month compared to a year prior, when your 200k-miles-strong 2006 Corolla was a hot commodity amid supply chain issues and parts shortages.

Not everyone is celebrating

Many people who purchased a Tesla shortly before the price cuts are not thrilled about having to make hefty loan payments on what is now a less valuable depreciating asset. Some disgruntled Tesla buyers signed a petition demanding free or discounted software downloads for their vehicles, while others have inquired about refunds, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Big picture: Major automakers, which enjoyed soaring profits last year, are now bracing for a reversal of fortunes and looking at ways to cut costs. But difficulties notwithstanding, many companies are still ramping up EV production and legacy car manufacturers are pushing forward with electrification goals.—SK

Two more officers relieved of duty over the deadly beating of Tyre Nichols. The Memphis Police Department revealed yesterday that in addition to the five officers charged with murder over the fatal beating, Preston Hemphill and another officer whose name was not released were taken off duty <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQnk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4535fbe1> after the incident. Although Hemphill’s lawyer told the Associated Press he was not present during the violence that killed Nichols, the officer was present for the traffic stop that preceded it, and body cam footage appears to show him saying he had tased Nichols and “I hope they stomp his ass.” In addition, three employees of the Memphis Fire Department were fired yesterday for their involvement. Nichols’s funeral tomorrow will be held tomorrow.

The White House disclosed the plan yesterday while opposing efforts by Republican lawmakers to end the emergency declarations immediately with a bill called the Pandemic Is Over Act. The end of the emergencies will mean that many Americans will have to start paying for Covid tests, treatments, and vaccines. It also signals a shift in how serious the government considers the pandemic to be.

Luxury retailer Hermès and non-fungible token designer Mason Rothschild faced off in court yesterday in the first major test of how trademark law applies to NFTs and other digital designs.

Hermès claims Rothschild infringed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQkE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C38c0d6c6> on its trademark by digitally depicting furry versions of its iconic Birkin bag in his collection of 100 “MetaBirkin” NFTs. But Rothschild argues that MetaBirkins are a lawful, artistic interpretation of the brand’s product—similar to Andy Warhol’s prints of Campbell’s soup cans.

NFTs have been a moneymaker for luxury brands

Dolce & Gabbana sold nine NFTs for about $6 million in September 2021.

Gucci bagged $25,000 on one short-film NFT two months prior.

MetaBirkens debuted at Art Basel in December 2021, and were sold and resold for tens of thousands of dollars. The platform they were originally listed on, OpenSea, pulled the collection at Hermès’s request, but copies continued to sell elsewhere.

Zoom out: The case’s outcome could set a precedent in this new area, but no matter who wins, the lawsuit itself could deter digital artists from featuring branded products in their designs.—JW

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will meet today to determine whether to rescind <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30404026.3016195/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xQjg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDQwNDAyNi4zMDE2MTk1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C39c1d860> Andrea Riseborough’s best actress nomination, and if it does happen, it would be the Academy’s most anti-indie-darling move of all time.

Riseborough’s nomination for her performance in To Leslie surprised Hollywood when it was announced, as the film had seemingly less heat than some Roku originals. To Leslie made less than $28,000 at the box office in a limited theatrical run. But in the waning days of the nominations voting period, endorsements poured in from stars like Jennifer Aniston, Kate Winslet, and Edward Norton. Cate Blanchett (also a nominee) even mentioned Riseborough in her Critics Choice Award acceptance speech.

What’s the issue? Well, there are many rules involved in Oscars voting, and in its campaign to receive votes, To Leslie may have violated a few. Potential issues are: a rule against contacting voters directly and encouraging promotion, and a rule against singling out competing nominees by name.

Zoom out: Most insiders predict that Riseborough’s nomination will be upheld, but some in the industry are upset that it takes away a place for lauded performances from Black actresses, like Danielle Deadwyler and Viola Davis, to be celebrated. Nominations have only been rescinded nine times in the history of the Oscars, and never for an acting nomination.—MK

Good morning. Scratch that, great morning because the Eagles are going to the Super Bowl . After dispatching the 49ers, the Birds will square off against the Chiefs, who beat the Bengals in a thrilling game.

And for the cherry on top: Unlike the Phillies, the Eagles winning a championship has not been found to be correlated with a recession.

Thirty years ago yesterday, the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US launched. In the decades since, these once-niche investment products have become ubiquitous on Wall Street, disrupting the mutual fund industry and transforming people’s relationship with the stock market.

You always remember your first

On Jan. 29, 1993, a dumb-looking spider decoration hanging in the American Stock Exchange heralded the arrival <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbe385e70> of the first US ETF—what’s now called the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. It had a measly $6.5 million in assets and no one really paid much attention to it.

That’s changed. The first US ETF is now the world’s biggest, with $375 billion in assets, and the ETF sector in total had amassed $6.5 trillion in assets by the end of 2022. While mutual funds still have 3x the amount of assets that ETFs have, the tide is turning: Investors poured $600 billion into US ETFs on a net basis last year, but pulled out almost $1 trillion from mutual funds.

So, how does an ETF work and why have they become so popular? An ETF is simply a security that tracks the performance of a particular basket of investments, like stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, for example, tracks the performance of companies in the S&P 500. Many other ETFs also track indexes, allowing people to park their money in funds that follow the ebbs and flows of the broader market.

If that sounds like a mutual fund…it’s similar. But ETFs have a few advantages <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca0b5a3d0> over its stuffy, older cousin.

ETFs generally have lower fees than mutual funds.

They have built-in tax benefits.

They’re accessible to anyone with a brokerage account—you can buy or sell them like you would a stock.

Zoom out: All these advantages aside, the rise of ETFs has been also fueled by the growing recognition that trying to invest in individual stocks is foolish. Passive index funds, which aren’t designed for frequent trading, have surged to represent almost half <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd3o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cbe4b1243> of US fund assets, compared to less than 2% in the early ’90s.

Authorities are frantically combing the desert in Western Australia to locate a tiny but highly radioactive capsule that was lost <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30394229.108032/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xd0U_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM5NDIyOS4xMDgwMzI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6675498c> in the vast, arid expanse.

The capsule seems to have fallen off a truck that was transporting it from a mine in the northern part of Western Australia to a suburb of Perth, the region’s largest city. And finding it won’t be simple: The route was 870 miles long and the capsule is smaller than a penny.

But what it lacks in size, the capsule makes up for in radiation. Containing the radioactive isotope cesium-137, the capsule emits the equivalent of 10 X-rays in an hour. Contact could cause burns, radiation sickness, and skin damage, and prolonged exposure could lead to cancer.

So, what’s it even used for? Mining companies deploy these capsules as sensors to calculate things like the thickness of pipes. The mining company that managed to lose this capsule, industry giant Rio Tinto, apologized and said it was launching an investigation into the perplexing circumstances of how this tiny object fell off a truck.

Good morning. Can ChatGPT write a funny comic? Max wanted to know. So he asked the chatbot to provide a topic for his Saturday Sketch, and then faithfully drew up the response.

We’ll let you judge the quality of the joke yourself, but at least from our POV…Max shouldn’t lose sleep over AI taking his job. For now.

Goldman Sachs tightened its belt at the expense of its CEO’s wallet. The investment bank announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdlM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce327bb26> yesterday that CEO David Solomon received a 29% pay cut in 2022. But it’s unlikely that he’ll be staging a walkout, as his new compensation still came in at a not-too-shabby $25 million.

Solomon’s shrinking paycheck reflects the financial struggles that have been plaguing the bank under his leadership:

Goldman Sachs has lost $3 billion since 2020 on its troubled foray into commercial banking, and its profits declined last year amid a slowing economy.

The bank let 3,200 employees go this month, its biggest layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis, according to the New York Times.

But Solomon is not the only CEO to see his pay package get smaller. Rival bank Morgan Stanley, as well as Apple and Alphabet, have all recently cut CEO compensation (in most cases alongside layoffs).

Why are executive pay cuts so hot right now?

Slashing executives’ pay is a cost-cutting measure that doubles as a way to signal that bosses are weathering economic headwinds alongside rank-and-file workers.

A 2021 study from Oxford University showed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdlQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C32e0cb70> that companies that prioritize paying employees over managers in difficult times tend to get a better rep with customers. It can also be a way to placate disgruntled shareholders who are not too pleased to sponsor the caviar-filled lifestyles of company leaders as they watch their investments dip into red territory.

Zoom out: CEOs still aren’t exactly hurting. The heads of the biggest US companies made 399 times more than the average worker in 2021, according to the Economic Policy Institute, an almost 20-fold increase in the pay ratio since 1965.—SK

Though the stock only ended up falling 6.4% by the time the market closed yesterday, Wall Street definitely took notice of the company’s troubles: Twenty-one analysts slashed what they thought it was worth, and many did not hold back in describing the chipmaker’s fall. “No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,” one said.

The timing is particularly bad for Adani, as yesterday marked the beginning of a planned $2.45 billion share sale.

The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it can’t vouch for the safety of cannabidiol <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdi0_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3621215c> (CBD)—a nonpsychoactive compound found in marijuana and hemp plants—and because of that, it can’t regulate it. Instead, it’s calling on lawmakers to help supervise $12 CBD lavender sodas.

Why? The FDA said that CBD doesn’t fit the mold of the dietary supplements and food additives it typically monitors, such as ginseng and caffeine. The agency claims the science is lacking on the safety of long-term CBD use, let alone on any potential perks—like preventing diabetes or aiding sleep.

This game of legal Hacky Sack is a major drag for CBD advocates

Congress legalized hemp four years ago, and most CBD is derived from hemp, not marijuana. As a result, CBD got kicked off the controlled substances list and got lobbed from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s desk to the FDA’s.

Since then, the FDA’s been less active in regulating CBD than a teen in a ’90s anti-marijuana ad.

Oh, to be an Amsterdammer—free from finessing a U-lock onto a frozen street sign. A new $65 million bike parking garage <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdzQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb1510da4> opened Wednesday in the largest city in the Netherlands, and it is all underwater.

Going under…the facility is at Amsterdam’s Centraal Station, which sees roughly 200,000 travelers arrive per day—about half by bike. To access the new parking facility, you can bike right up to the moving walkways that take you and your wheels into the depths of what used to be just canal water. The structure took four years to build and can hold 7,000 bikes. Its capacity will increase to 11,000 when a second structure opens in February. (Here’s a pretty sick time lapse <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30384369.3014885/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xdzU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM4NDM2OS4zMDE0ODg1/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C37d934f0> of how they drained all that water and built the garage.)

While it cost a lot to build, the parking is cheaper than most bus fares in the US: Parking is free for the first 24 hours and roughly $1.46 per day after that.

Big picture: This new facility is a logical investment for a country in which bicycles outnumber the residents. Dutch people are the most physically active on the planet primarily because biking is such a huge part of their daily lives, according to a 2021 study from global research firm Ipsos.—MM

Good morning. TIL there is such a thing as “burrito season.” Chipotle said yesterday it’s hiring 15,000 employees to prep for “burrito season”—the period from March–May that represents its busiest sales stretch on the calendar.

So if we’re getting this right…

March–May: burrito season

June–August: ribs season

September: soup season

October: spooky season

November: Soup Season 2: The Return of the Soup

December–February: cuffing season

ECONOMY

How’s the economy doing? <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2D5efcc8d3> Larry David saying <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2E5efcc8d3> Curb Your Enthusiasm/HBO via Giphy
Larry David’s favorite tagline also happens to be an apt description of the economy right now: It’s pretty, pretty good.

US gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at a 2.9% annualized pace <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C91286dd9> in Q4 2022, which topped expectations. And it’s rock-solid proof that the recession we’ve been warned about for months ain’t here yet.

Not only has the US economy regained <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczk_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C840b50c3> all the lost output from the Covid recession, but it’s also returned to its growth trajectory from before the pandemic. Real GDP per capita, which factors in inflation, has reached its highest level ever.

Is this a sign of a “soft landing”? Q4’s strong GDP numbers add fuel to the argument that the Fed could actually pull off the tricky “soft landing”—where it knocks down inflation through interest rate hikes without sending economic growth into reverse. The resilient labor market is cooperating: Despite all the headlines about layoffs, jobless claims fell last week to their lowest point since April 2022.

But don’t write off a recession just yet

Economists combing through the GDP report found a few warning signs that indicate a recession remains a clear and present danger. Here are a few:

Consumers are pulling back. Personal consumption, which represents about 70% of all US output, came in below forecasts, signaling Americans aren’t reaching for their wallets like they had been earlier in the pandemic. Growth in business inventories also suggest a more cautious consumer.

The housing market got pummeled. The sector shrank at a 27% annualized pace last quarter as higher mortgage rates put home-buying and construction on ice.

Companies are slowing down their spending. In Q3, business investment grew 6.2%; in Q4, just 0.7%.

Bottom line: The US economy is in a fluid state right now, being tugged in different directions by large, complex forces. Even the people who study it 50 hours a week only speak in probabilities (e.g., “there’s an X% chance Y will happen”). When execs and economists say the outlook is “uncertain”—they mean it.—NF

Four University of Minnesota Law School exams in Constitutional Law, Employee Benefits, Taxation, and Torts (not the dessert)

These tests contained a mix of short-answer, essay, and multiple choice questions—and ChatGPT received passing, but not gold-star, grades in all of them. Examiners noted that ChatGPT was much better at writing than math, which…same.

Big picture: SmarterChild 2.0’s success has educators debating AI’s role in the classroom and how to best assess student learning in the new ChatGPT era. While some want to keep AI tools out of class by, say, requiring students to write out work by hand, others say we should embrace the new tech as a support tool, like a tutor or calculator.—JW

“If you sue me, I’m not going to let you see Billy Joel live.”

That’s essentially how James Dolan, the CEO of Madison Square Garden Entertainment and billionaire owner of the Knicks, defended <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.3016744/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xc28_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4zMDE2NzQ0/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce3e4996c> the company’s controversial use of facial recognition at its venues.

In a rare TV interview yesterday, Dolan claimed that “the Garden has to defend itself,” and threatened to halt alcohol sales at Rangers hockey games to generate negative publicity for regulators. “I don’t need the liquor,” he said.

It’s about that—and broader backlash over MSG’s alleged practice of using facial recognition tech to identify and ban lawyers employed at firms involved in MSG-related cases from entering its venues.

New York has launched an investigation into MSG’s use of facial recognition tech, which has impacted 90 law firms, according to NY Attorney General Letitia James.

Good morning. Welp—looks like we were wrong about the prospect of snow accumulation in NYC yesterday (was mostly miserable rain). Probably best to retire as meteorologists and stick to something we’re much better at: running courses that help you get better at your career.

Speaking of, the Business Essentials Accelerator, our eight-week online course on business fundamentals, is kicking off Feb. 6.

If it feels like recent US mass attacks have startlingly similar details, it’s because many of them do. A new study <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1A_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc5e8cb06> from the Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center examined 173 public attacks occurring from 2016 to 2020 and found patterns that repeated from Uvalde, TX, to the back-to-back shootings in California this past weekend.

Some commonalities:

Who: Almost all attackers acted alone and were men. Though attackers ranged in age from 14 to 87, the average age skewed younger at 34.

What: Nearly 73% of attacks involved firearms, and most of those were fatal. The remaining attacks that didn’t involve firearms were mostly nonfatal.

Why: Nearly all attackers experienced a significant stressor, such as a loved one dying, in the five years prior to the attack, and 77% of them experienced one within a year. Half of the incidents were motivated by “perceived wrongs” in the workplace or at home.

The killing of seven people in Half Moon Bay, California, on Monday was described <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1E_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfcdcf654> by officials as an act of “workplace violence.”

Most attackers had similar red flags

The study says that nearly half of attackers had a history of misogyny and/or domestic violence—and that those behaviors “deserve increased attention” from law enforcement. Violent online posting and chatting can also signal an individual may commit an attack. The Uvalde, TX, shooter, for example, threatened <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1I_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C49ce0464> women online and shared graphically misogynistic content.

Nearly two-thirds of attackers said or did things so “objectively concerning” that the report says they “should have been met with an immediate response.” Many of these were even reported to law enforcement, employers, and others prior to the mass attack.

The report’s big takeaway? Recognizing shared patterns among past mass attacks early could help prevent future incidents.

Zoom out: Over 39 incidents of mass violence have already occurred in the US this year, and two incidents happened in California just this past week. Legislators are debating what laws they can pass <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb1M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cefcd33cf> to slow or stop the momentum.—JW

Ukraine is getting new tanks. Both the US and Germany agreed yesterday to send tanks <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca50bfcf3> to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion—something Ukraine has said it needs to win the war. The US will send 31 M1 Abrams tanks, while Germany will provide 14 Leopard 2 A6 models. Though Western allies have been arming Ukraine since the war began nearly a year ago, there was hesitation over whether sending tanks would be considered an escalation. And while President Biden stressed this move was “not an offensive threat to Russia,” Russia has stated that sending tanks will make the possibility of talks to end the war less likely.

Meta said Trump’s risk to public safety has “sufficiently receded” since then. Before being banned, Trump was the most followed person on Facebook. It’s not the only social network to welcome him back: Trump’s Twitter account was reinstated in November (though he has yet to post there, sticking to his own competitor, Truth Social…for now).

More than half of all US abortions are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and questions concerning the legality of these abortions have proliferated since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. A separate suit also filed yesterday by a North Carolina doctor challenges that state’s ban, but abortion opponents have their own suit pending in Texas to try to overturn the FDA’s drug approval.

A US-based short seller has set its sights on a Goliath-sized target. The firm, Hindenburg Research, released a 100-page report on Tuesday alleging <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb24_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C61fc2f8e> that the Adani Group, led by the world’s fourth richest person—Gautam Adani—was “pulling the largest con in corporate history.”

According to Hindenburg, Adani Group (one of India’s largest business conglomerates that’s seen as “too big to fail,” given Indian taxpayers’ exposure to it) has run a “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme” for decades, using shell entities to siphon off taxpayer money. Adani Group companies lost $12 billion in market value after the report’s release—something that, if you own a conglomerate, you don’t want to happen.

Adani himself dropped a whole spot on the world’s richest list, falling below Jeff Bezos and just out of the top three.

In response, Adani Group dismissed the allegations and accused Hindenburg of timing the report’s release in bad faith to undermine an upcoming stock sale.

What's at stake: This report makes Adani Group the largest target of Hindenburg Research, and it’s a test of the firm’s power. Hindenburg was relatively unknown until 2020, when its report on then-hot EV maker Nikola became a pillar in the government’s fraud case against the company’s founder.—MK

A $1.5 million Tennessee mansion went viral this week…despite its Zillow listing using a photo of it literally on fire. And in case you were wondering if buying homes is still hard: It’s already under contract <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30360855.3032687/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xb3M_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDM2MDg1NS4zMDMyNjg3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb60f11d1>.

The hopeful buyer, Mike Thakur, plans to vlog his restoration process, riding the property’s wave of internet virality and milking that charred house for as much content as possible.

The burnt home…sits on almost five acres of land in Franklin, TN, and includes a bunch of grand staircases, an outdoor kitchen, and a detached guesthouse—where Thakur and his family will live while they fix up the main manor. The house had a fire in September that caused significant damage, but in 2020 (pre-fire) it sold for $10 million, according to a press release from Newswires.

We don’t know how much the self-described content creator/serial entrepreneur is paying for the house, but it was only listed last Tuesday and had a lot of interest from potential buyers, according to the realtors.

Big picture: There’s also growing interest in non-burned down homes. Redfin data found that pending house sales in the US rose 3% last month, the first increase since October 2021. After a tumultuous year, housing demand seems to be rising slowly from the ashes.—MM

Good morning. Today is National Compliment Day, which…isn’t a real holiday, but it is an excuse to say something nice to someone today.

But not all compliments are created equal. While procrastinating writing the newsletter, we discussed the best types of compliments you can get. A few we came up with:

When someone asks for your recipe at the potluck

When a high school friend’s parents remember your name (or pretty close)

“I see you've been flossing!”—your dentist

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list. Reply with the compliments that give you an especially potent dopamine high.

The corporate podcasting boom may be ending, not with a too-long preamble before the guest, but a whimper. Spotify announced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30336596.3021342/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xaFU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMzNjU5Ni4zMDIxMzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce18f8052> yesterday that it will lay off about 600 employees, or 6% of its workforce, in the latest Big Tech recession hedge. The shakeup could signal a pivot in the company’s podcast strategy.

Like most of the other major tech companies making cuts, Spotify cited overly ambitious pandemic growth as the primary cause, and CEO Daniel Ek took “full accountability” for the move. Along with the layoffs, Ek announced a major departure from the audio streamer: Chief Content Officer Dawn Ostroff, who was the driving force behind the company’s $1+ billion podcasting arms race to sign deals with companies like Gimlet and high-profile talent like Barack and Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Joe Rogan.

Although the layoffs don’t specifically target Spotify’s podcasting staff, the departure of Ostroff is yet another sign that the company is slowing down its full-steam-ahead approach to the space. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported the company froze its US budget for new podcasts. The company also didn’t re-up its exclusive deal with Brené Brown, and back in October it pulled 11 originals from the platform.

Overzealous for pods

The tech industry megadeals of the pandemic may have been premature—podcasting made up just 7% of total listening on Spotify in Q1 2022, the company said, despite the massive investment in tentpole shows. And the exclusive show model that makes popular shows available only to subscribers of a given streamer hasn’t proven wildly successful—the Gimlet and Parcast unions announced that making certain shows Spotify exclusives reduced their listenership by, in some instances, as much as 75%.

Zoom out: Sirius XM and Amazon Music have also hit the brakes on pods, reducing signing offers and increasing their share of advertising revenue. On the whole, 2022 just wasn’t the best year to talk into a microphone. According to data compiled by Chartr, the number of new shows created last year dropped 80% from 2020. —MK

First, a quick lesson.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) own real estate properties that generate income, equity, or both. There are public and private REITs, which trade on and off the stock market.

And there are public, non-traded REITs. These aren’t traded on the stock market, but are SEC-qualified and regulated to give investors more transparency.

Covid shots might get more like flu shots.

As with the flu, a group of experts would meet yearly to determine which variants should be targeted, and then a once-a-year shot would be made available to the public. The agency is mulling the shift at a moment when only 15% of Americans who are eligible for the most recent Covid booster shot have gotten one. On Thursday an FDA committee will vote on whether to recommend the plan.

Alex Murdaugh, a prominent lawyer and the scion of an important South Carolina legal dynasty, is accused of murdering his wife and son. The trial is happening in Walterboro, SC, a small city located in the jurisdiction where three generations of Murdaughs had served as prosecuting attorneys.

Murdaugh’s alleged crime resume

In 2021 Murdaugh’s wife and son were shot and killed at the family’s hunting property, and a year later prosecutors charged him with the crime. They contend he committed the double murder to win sympathy and divert attention from his shady financial dealings and the legal troubles from a fatal boating accident involving his son. Murdaugh maintains his innocence.

In total, there are more than 100 indictments against Alex Murdaugh. In addition to the alleged murders, he had also been accused of a litany of financial crimes, including:

A multimillion-dollar fraud scheme that siphoned money from his family law firm and its clients

Diverting of funds from the estate of his housekeeper who died at his home from a “trip and fall accident”

Layoffs are hitting the confectionary industry: M&Ms announced yesterday that it’s sending its colorful cast of candy characters into “indefinite <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30336596.3021342/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xaTU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMzNjU5Ni4zMDIxMzQy/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2db69529>” retirement.

It appears these characters became too much of a PR headache for the company over criticism that they had lost their sex appeal.

The backstory: Last year, M&M’s began to make changes to its candy spokespeople to be more “representative of the customer” and to keep up with cultural trends—for instance, by replacing the green M&M’s high heels with sneakers.

To some right-wing commentators, these changes reflected the “woke” movement’s hijacking of American culture. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been the most vocal critic of the M&M’s makeover, saying on his show last January that “M&M’s will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous. Until the moment you wouldn’t want to have a drink with any one of them.”

In its statement, a defeated-sounding M&Ms acknowledged “even a candy’s shoes can be polarizing.” It said it will replace its spokescandies with former SNL star Maya Rudolph.—NF

Testifying as he defends himself against a lawsuit from shareholders who claim the tweet cost them money, the Tesla CEO maintained that any other association was mere coincidence. Still, it wouldn’t be the only time Musk sneaked an apparent marijuana joke into his business dealings: His offer to buy Twitter was for $54.20 per share.

Ten people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a ballroom dance studio in Monterey Park, CA, on Saturday night. The attack <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZTc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C363214bf> occurred as thousands celebrated Lunar New Year’s Eve in this majority Asian American city just east of Los Angeles.

Yesterday, police found <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZUQ_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3bf64ca0> the suspected gunman, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a white van in Torrance, a city about 30 miles from Monterey Park.

That van fit the description of a vehicle used in another attempted shooting Saturday night in the city of Alhambra, when people at a dance hall disarmed a gun-carrying man before he fled the scene. Officials believe there is a connection between the shooting in Monterey Park and the thwarted incident in Alhambra, but have not yet discovered a motive.

It is the deadliest mass shooting in the US since 21 people were killed at a school in Uvalde, TX, last May, and the 33rd mass shooting so far this year.

“The first suburban Chinatown”

Monterey Park was the first city in the continental US to have a majority of residents with Asian ancestry: Of its current 60,000 residents, 65% are of Asian descent, and they’ve established Monterey Park as a hub of Chinese culture in the San Gabriel Valley. The city is dotted with Asian American restaurants and grocery stores, and Chinese films are frequently screened there, per the AP.

Monterey Park, decked out with red lanterns, had been looking forward to hosting its Lunar New Year fair this weekend after Covid canceled it in the last two years. Historically drawing crowds of more than 100,000 people, its Lunar New Year celebration is one of the largest free street fairs in Southern California. The second day of festivities, which was set for Sunday, was canceled following the attack (though authorities said there was no connection between the two).

Big picture: The Asian American community was approaching this Lunar New Year’s celebration with both an eagerness to gather IRL again, but also trepidation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZTg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4adfd0c9> over the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. Advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said in a statement that this attack, “on one of the most important days of the year for many Asian Americans…is sending shockwaves through our community.”

Abortion rights supporters marched <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZWM_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C56ad452d> in cities across the country, drawing attention to the myriad legislative battles over abortion access that are now being fought at the state and local levels. Days before, anti-abortion activists staged the first March for Life in Washington, DC, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court.

On the Sunday talk shows, both Democrats and Republicans said they were concerned about these and other findings of classified docs that have dripped out in the past few weeks. Biden said he has “no regrets” about his handling of the situation, and his team and other Dems have tried to emphasize how Biden has cooperated with authorities in their investigation.

A busy weekend of playoff football. The Chiefs handled the Jaguars, my Eagles demolished the Giants, Cincinnati trounced Buffalo (with Damar Hamlin attending in-person), and the 49ers beat the Cowboys. Next Sunday’s conference championship games will determine who plays in the Super Bowl: Philly will face San Francisco, and the Chiefs will meet the Bengals in a rematch of last year’s AFC Championship Game.

It’s James Cameron’s world; we’re just swimming in it.

The director’s film, Avatar: The Way of Water, topped $2 billion <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZWY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cee3e9352> at the box office this weekend, becoming just the sixth movie in history to reach the milestone. Cameron is responsible for three of those six—Avatar, Titanic, and Avatar 2 (the others are Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Avengers: Infinity War).

It will be just a matter of days until Avatar 2 climbs from No. 6 on the list to No. 4, leaping over Infinity War ($2.04 billion) and The Force Awakens ($2.07 billion) as it heads into its seventh week in theaters.

When that happens, the movie could earn another accolade: being profitable. Before the release of the uber-costly Avatar 2, Cameron said <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30326536.3401248/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZWc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMyNjUzNi4zNDAxMjQ4/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C6a6f0efb> it was the “worst business case in movie history” and would need to become the third- or fourth-highest grossing film of all time to break even.

Zoom out: James Cameron is the movie theater equivalent of Shohei Ohtani—a superstar playing on a sorry team. Cinemas are not in a good place right now: Last week, Regal (whose parent company went bankrupt) said it was closing 39 locations in the US, and AMC has lost all of its meme-stock juice.

Good news for them, though, is that ol’ reliable Cameron plans to release three more Avatar installments in the next five years.

By making boatloads for its clients, Citadel did pretty well for itself, too, charging $12 billion in fees and expenses.

Good morning. We did it, folks—we made it through the darkest timeline. The sun will set at 5pm in New York City tonight, and the next pre-5pm sunset won’t be until November 6. It’s basically pool weather.

Netflix stock soared on the news that it gained more subscribers than expected, since everyone keeps binge watching its original programming. So, if you bought Netflix for $1 when it IPOed 21 years ago and hung onto it all this time…good for you.

Across the United States, tens of thousands of tech workers are waking up to the longest weekend of their professional lives.

Google parent company Alphabet became the latest tech giant to conduct mass layoffs <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDU_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C378dd98e>, beginning to let go of 12,000 employees (~6% of its workforce) yesterday morning. And while layoffs have been hitting tech for months now, this week felt particularly painful: Three of the biggest tech companies in the world—Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon—all announced job cuts that affected 40,000 employees combined.

That brings total layoffs in the tech industry to more than 200,000 <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDY_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3a13fbc9> over the last year, the FT notes.

That’s a huge number

But it only underscores Big Tech’s breathtaking hiring spree during the pandemic. Believe it or not, most Big Tech workforces are up—way up—since the beginning of Covid. Let’s take a look at the numbers:

Microsoft hired 40,000 people from June 2021 to June 2022. So after the recent layoffs, it’s still up 30,000 employees (or more than one Visa) in 18 months.

Alphabet’s 12,000 layoffs represent ~33% of the 36,751 staff it hired in the single year to September 2022.

Meta hired more than 26,000 employees in 2020 and 2021; it recently cut 11,000 jobs.

So what’s going on? Big Tech companies feasted during the Covid boom times, believing they’d never get heartburn later on. Now, facing a deteriorating economic environment, they’re letting go of some “moonshot” ideas, promoting efficiency <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf4fa9dc9>, and being more surgical about their investments (like in AI).

One factor, CNBC suggests <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZDg_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cc134002b>, could be that it hired far more methodically than its peers during the pandemic.

Ukraine’s hopes of getting German tanks have tanked (for now). Its allies met in Germany yesterday and agreed to send more weapons aid to the country, but failed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30316522.3040131/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xZGc_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMxNjUyMi4zMDQwMTMx/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C8e7aa5e1> to reach an agreement on supplying tanks.

Why are tanks still a big deal in the age of drones?

Drones and surface-to-air missile systems may be more modern, but Ukraine says it’s got to have the good ol’ armored beasts to mount a counteroffensive against Russia.

The armored vehicles equipped with heavy guns are the go-to when breaking enemy lines in a ground offensive.

Both sides are preparing for a major forward push in the spring, and state-of-the art tanks would be ideal for the flatlands in the east of the country, where much of the anticipated combat will likely take place.

Ukraine is currently fighting with Soviet- and Russian-made tanks, but they are not the next-gen machines its war effort requires. The UK recently agreed to supply 14 heavy-duty tanks, but Ukraine says it needs 300 of them.

Zoom out: While the tank situation remains uncertain, Ukraine’s allies consented to send it an assortment of weapons including air-defense systems, rockets, and artillery rounds. The US is planning a $2.5 billion arms shipment that for the first time includes the powerful Stryker armored combat vehicles.—SK

What makes it green? The comet, nicknamed ZTF, is similar to other giant hurtling balls of dust and frozen gas, but produces a unique glowing green light. How? The sun’s ultraviolet radiation hits the diatomic carbon in the comet (which is actually just two carbon atoms fused together) and…we would go more into that, but this isn’t Space Brew.

Scientists first spotted ZTF last March, and now it’s your turn: For northern hemisphere residents, your best bet is to look north this weekend, either late in the evening or early in the morning in a place with little light pollution. The comet will be close to the Draco constellation starting tonight. You have until about early February when ZTF heads to the southern hemisphere.

Besides just looking cool…Astronomers will study the rare comet over the next month to hopefully get a better glimpse of the phenomenon that may have helped create life on earth, before it leaves our solar system.

Prosecutors announced yesterday that actor Alec Baldwin and Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN04_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5f2b503b> for the on-set shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza in 2021.

The charge, filed in New Mexico, is a fourth-degree felony, which means that Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed could face up to 18 months behind bars and a $5,000 fine. But prosecutors also tacked on a provision that could result in five years of prison time because a gun was involved.

Baldwin’s attorney responded, “This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice…we will fight these charges, and we will win.” Baldwin also sued crew members including Gutierrez-Reed and Rust assistant director David Halls in November, alleging they were negligent in handing him the gun.

How we got here

During a rehearsal for the movie Rust in October 2021, Baldwin’s gun—which was pointed at Hutchins—fired live ammunition and killed her. Baldwin has repeatedly denied pulling the trigger, saying that he had started to cock the gun and released the hammer. Gun experts have been hesitant to support Baldwin’s claim, arguing that would be essentially impossible.

So, how did this happen? Investigators for the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Department haven’t released information on how live ammunition ended up on a film set, but a separate investigation by the state’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau found that firearm procedures on the set were lax. The agency fined Rust’s production company the maximum amount ($137,000) for not following proper safety precautions.

The report also uncovered <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN08_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C33b69e37> emails and texts that producers sent to Gutierrez-Reed urging her to spend less time on her gun-handling and training tasks to make time for her other props duties.

Two firearm misfires five days before the fatal shooting went ignored by Rust management, per the report.

Big picture: The tragedy on the Rust set renewed long-standing safety concerns in the film industry over fatal prop gun mishaps on sets, as well as the minimal training required to become a firearms specialist for film and TV.—MM

Many workers also went on strike, resulting in the closing of schools and the cancellation of transit routes and flights. But the battle over the retirement age is just getting started, as major French unions announced a second day of strikes on January 31.

As the US crashed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN1g_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cec8917d1> into the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling yesterday, the Treasury Department began taking what it called “extraordinary measures” to prevent the government from defaulting on its debts and sparking an economic crisis.

What does that actually mean? These measures are a series of deep-cut accounting moves <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xN1k_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C24f23c7f> that allow the Treasury to continue making its payments. They include:

Suspending reinvestments into government funds for retired federal employees, such as the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

Selling existing investments in those funds to free up more outstanding debt.

And while these measures definitely aren’t ordinary…they probably aren’t so “extra,” either. The Treasury has resorted to them more than 12 times since 1985, including during the last debt-ceiling standoff in 2021.

Still, these steps amount to chugging water after eating a ghost pepper—the pain will return. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her extraordinary measures will last through early June, giving lawmakers about five months to work out a deal to raise the debt ceiling.

Big picture: The US has never defaulted on its debt, but even the threat of it could be disastrous. The country’s first credit downgrade in history came during a debt-ceiling showdown in 2011.—NF

With the sheepish energy of someone requesting a refund from the Girl Scouts because their Thin Mints box is dented, Amazon on Wednesday announced that it will shutter <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xODE_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cfc26854b> its charitable donation program, AmazonSmile, by Feb. 20.

AmazonSmile was launched in 2013 and donated 0.5% of eligible purchases to a charity of a customer’s choice. As of the end of December, the program had doled out about $449 million to a wide variety of charities over its existence. Still, Amazon claims AmazonSmile hasn’t been as impactful as it originally hoped. The sheer number of charities in the program (1+ million globally) spread its donations too thin, the company wrote in an email to customers.

The move is yet another entry in a string of measures the tech giant has taken in recent weeks to cut costs after a pandemic hiring spree doubled its global workforce to over 1.6 million.

Those other cost cuts: Amazon announced this month that it would lay off more than 18,000 workers in what likely is the largest workforce reduction in the company’s history. Amazon has also called it quits on riskier business ventures like its telehealth service and a video chat projector for kids.—MK

Since then, the league has seen an explosion in international players. In 1997, there were 29 international players on opening day rosters; this season there are 120 from 41 countries, accounting for about one-third of all players. And they’re among the best in the NBA—two international players (Serbia’s Nikola Jokić and Greece’s Giannis Antetokounmpo) won the last four MVP awards.

ANSWER

13112221. This is a pretty diabolical set of integers known as the “Look-and-say sequence <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30304507.3472363/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xOGs_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDMwNDUwNy4zNDcyMzYz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C192debf5>.” To get the next number in the sequence, you read off the digits of the previous item.

For instance, “1” is “one one” so the next item is “11.” From that comes “two ones,” so you write down “21” and so on. So, to get the next term in the sequence above, it would be “one three, one one, two twos, two ones.”

Good morning. The countdown to economic catastrophe has officially begun . The US will hit its debt ceiling today, though Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she’ll implement “extraordinary measures” that will keep the government from defaulting on its debt until probably early June.

Still, June isn’t that far away, and Congress needs to work out a deal pronto to raise the government’s borrowing cap and avert almost assured economic turmoil and market chaos.

What were we saying again? Oh yeah, good morning.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP

The pandemic’s entrepreneurial boom isn’t over yet <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2De36b5957> Mark Cuban on Shark Tank <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2o_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ee36b5957> Shark Tank/ABC Network via Giphy
At the rate Americans are creating new businesses, Shark Tank is going to need to increase its episode count by about 4,000 to keep up with demand. More than 5 million new business applications were filed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30290915.3069773/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xM2s_bWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJmJmNpZD0zMDI5MDkxNS4zMDY5Nzcz/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7844788f> in 2022, according to new data from the US Census Bureau.

About 14,000 new business applications were filed in the US every day last year—although it’s still too soon to know how many of those aspiring Scrub Daddies will actually make it off the ground.

Whether this represents a testament to the country’s entrepreneurial spirit, an indictment of 9-to-5s, or simply a case of everyone seeing the same TikTok about the tax benefits of forming an LLC, it’s a sign that the pandemic-era startup boom may be here to stay.

And it was quite a boom

Despite the vast number of Steve Jobs biopics that were being created, the US was actually experiencing a 40-year decline in entrepreneurship before the pandemic, per the NYT. But then things changed: The number of new businesses created in 2020 increased by 24% from 2019 to 4.3 million as laid-off workers found their savings accounts boosted by stimulus payments and a bull market. Also helpful: rock-bottom interest rates.

The trend continued in 2021, ballooning to 5.4 million applications.

And now we know that the swell continued into 2022. But some areas saw more growth than others. The Southern US has had a 53% increase in new businesses since 2019, with the most growth coming from Florida and Texas, per Bloomberg analysis. New England, on the other hand, is falling below the national average.

Looking ahead…we’ll have to wait and see if these businesses thrive and the trend continues in 2023. A looming potential recession, high inflation, and personal savings dropping to near 60-year lows (per the Bureau of Economic Analysis) all signal turbulence ahead for new companies, which already have a roughly 50% failure rate during good economic times.—MK

These are just the latest tech company layoffs, many of which have begun thinning their ranks after rapidly expanding during the pandemic now that they’re facing rising interest rates, smaller digital ad budgets, and less consumer spending. According to the tracker Layoffs.fyi, the sector shed more than 154,000 jobs in 2022 and has already cut around ~37,500 this year.

Not even the powerhouse of dresses with weird cutouts has been spared by investors’ newfound skepticism toward exorbitant tech company valuations.

Fast rise: Shein grew rapidly in the last few years, and was considered a no-brainer investment for backers flush with cash.

Fast fall: Now, after spending years throwing billions at any tech company whose slide deck had the word “disruptor” in it, VCs are getting stingy as interest rates rise and the global economy slows down. So, Shein (along with a lot of other companies) is stuck entering a “down round”—i.e., being forced to raise funds at a much lower valuation, the FT reported, though the company told the FT it “denied the accuracy” of some of the report.

The University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest public universities in the nation, banned <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9faD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cb8084d01> TikTok from its wi-fi and across its wired networks yesterday—and not because someone made a call-out video of Bevo’s Shein haul.

The university is complying with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s recent decision to forbid state employees from having the app on government-issued devices. And it’s just the latest major US campus to confine its students to Instagram Reels: Public universities in at least five states, including Auburn University in Alabama, the University of Montana, and schools in the University System of Georgia, have banned the app.

The backstory: In the last few months, more than half of US states have barred TikTok from government devices, according to CNN. Government officials all the way up to President Biden—who last month signed legislation that included a TikTok ban for federal devices—are on edge about the national security and privacy concerns around the app, which is owned by China’s ByteDance. In the past year, ByteDance has admitted to tracking journalists who cover it, and accessing US TikTok user data from China.

These college bans will mostly be...annoying

When you tell a college student not to do something, they’re probably going to find a way to do it. Tech-savvy undergrads are skirting the bans by using their own data or personal wi-fi to access one of their favorite social media platforms.

Still, the bans are causing uncertainty, and everyone from communications professors to the people running university mascot accounts are wondering how these restrictions will affect their work. Think of the college improv teams trying to Impractical Jokers people, or the sorority rush chairs who use the app to hype recruitment.

But it goes beyond depleting DG’s follower count: Some critics also argue that banning TikTok on university wi-fi hinders <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9faT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C957bbe04> professors’ abilities to better understand the app and how it spreads the misinformation politicians are so concerned about.

Bottom line: It’s unlikely that most students at UT-Austin, Auburn, or any other school that decides to ban TikTok in the future will ditch the app. According to Pew, 67% of 13- to 17-year-olds have used the platform, making it the second most popular app behind YouTube.—MM

Protesters had been trying to defend the town, called Lützerath, for years, turning it into a symbol of government hypocrisy on climate change. But the energy crisis spurred by the war in Ukraine and Germany’s desperate search for more energy sources, lent new urgency to the coal mine’s expansion. Last week, hundreds of protesters who had been living in Lützerath were cleared out by police.

The last time this happened was in 1959–1961, when the abysmal Great Leap Forward economic initiative caused widespread famines.

Though it occurred sooner than demographers predicted, the current decline isn’t shocking—China's birthrate has been dropping for years, reaching a record low in modern history in 2022. Observers blame the high cost of parenthood, strict COVID lockdowns, and decades of the restrictive one-child rule. As a result of the country’s aging population, funerals outnumbered baby showers by about 850,000 last year.

Everyone–not just China–should be worried

An aging population usually creates a noxious economic cocktail of less working-age people available to fill jobs and more retirees requiring costly care. This can slow economic growth (any gains in the daytime television industry notwithstanding), which for various reasons <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30279635.3066208/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9fcT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjc5NjM1LjMwNjYyMDg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1f0970ad> in China was already at a multi-decade low of just 3% last year.

If things go south for the world’s second-largest economy, the rest of the world would feel it, too. Fewer workers in the exporting powerhouse of China could mean more expensive products for consumers globally, as well as reduced demand for goods and services that the country sources from abroad.

Sales of canned seafood shot up by 10% (to $2.7 billion) in the US in 2022, according to Euromonitor International. The primary driver? TikToks in which aesthetic, photogenic tinned fish boards are prepared as part of a romantic date night charcuterie.

While some users claim the trend is “giving Great Depression,” it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Over the course of last year, users on the app posted their #tinnedfish dinners—some claiming to do this every week—and the hashtag now has more than 26 million views.

Companies are jumping aboard the cannedwagon, utilizing vintage design styles in packaging and developing new strategies, like selling pairing kits, to move fish. Scout Canning, a popular Vancouver-based brand, told the WSJ that its revenues jumped 82% in 2022.

ANSWER

A writing tip you can keep in your pocket (if it’s not already there) is that adverbs ending in -ly should not be hyphenated. Here “softly-enforced” should become “softly enforced.”

If Bernard Arnault had more than one daughter, this sentence would be correct. But he only has one, so “Delphine Arnault” should be offset by commas.

Here is a classic case of a misplaced modifier, as it sounds like the early days won a narrow majority in the House. The fix we went with: “With a narrow majority in the House, the GOP needs to optimize…”

The problem here is homonyms. We meant “defused,” which means to make less tense. “Diffused” means spreading out.

The ongoing tug of war between remote employees (who are feeling more productive and less burnt out) and their employers (who are feeling bad about paying for an office) could experience a balance shift in 2023. Major companies, aware of fears about a potential recession, are issuing directives <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XaT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C85e847b2> to come into the office for more days, sometimes under the threat of termination.

Last week, Disney CEO Bob Iger told hybrid staff that, starting on March 1, they must return to the office four days a week. Two days later, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced a similar three-day RTO requirement, expressing irritation at internal badge swipe data that revealed employees were not “meeting their minimum promise” regarding hybrid work.

Employees at Vanguard, Paycom, and News Corp have also received recent orders to phase out remote work in the new year. A survey from Resume Builder found that 90% of companies will require a return to the office this year, signaling a shift away from the softly enforced hybrid policies that became popular during the pandemic.

A controversial resolution

That doesn’t mean employees are excited to add commute time or “getting asked about weekend plans” back into their lives: According to a recent Gallup poll, 34% of remote-capable workers want to work from home permanently and just 3% want to work in the office full time. A Monster survey in September found that 40% of workers would quit if they had to come into the office even one day a week.

But there’s an issue with that: Remote work is getting hard to find. Between February and October 2022, remote job listings fell from 20% to 14% of all listings on LinkedIn. Now, even more employers seem empowered to demand <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XTT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C22719f95> in-office time.

Messina Denaro, who once bragged that you could “fill a cemetery” with his victims, is allegedly the head of the Cosa Nostra syndicate. Despite dodging authorities since 1993, he has been convicted in absentia and given life sentences for his role in various crimes, including the murder of two anti-Mafia prosecutors; bombings in Florence, Milan, and Rome that killed 10; and the slaying of the young son of a Mafioso who turned state’s witness.

So far, Musk is expected to testify this week, and his odds don’t look great: The judge already determined that the tweet was false and reckless, but now a jury will weigh whether Musk knew it was false and whether it was material to investors.

Art made by AI has won prizes, been displayed in museums, and taken over Twitter profile pics, but not everyone’s happy with how it turns users into elven princesses.

Three artists are suing <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9XcT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd1904dd4> Midjourney, Stability AI, and DeviantArt for their use of an AI art-generating tool called Stable Diffusion. The artists—Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz—allege the tool violates millions of artists’ copyrights.

How AI art generators work: Stable Diffusion has been fed billions of images scraped from the web in order to train its AI on how to do things like identify an “avocado.” So when a user types “corgi eats an avocado in space” into an AI art generator that uses Stable Diffusion, it creates new works <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30267060.104296/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Xcj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjY3MDYwLjEwNDI5Ng/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ca06ef6f9> based on the images it’s analyzed.

But whether it’s derivative or plagiarism is up for debate

The suit claims that Stable Diffusion cobbles together pieces of copyrighted images, but creators of AI art-generating tools argue that their use of existing pictures to train the AI to make new ones is covered by “fair use” doctrine—which allows using copyrighted materials for “transformative” purposes.

Bottom line: This case could set an important precedent on training AI tools that could go way beyond the art world.—JW

But the man would have turned 317 today, so it’s about time his invention was updated—especially since the Franklin rod is a godsend for your home, but it’s insufficient for bigger places like airports or wind farms.

So, how did we one-up a founding father?

Scientists unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of laser pulses at thunderclouds, creating a path of charged particles that lightning was more likely to follow. Four lightning bolts were steered toward a rod mounted on top of a telecom tower that is a frequent target of lightning strikes.

Looking forward: It’ll be a while before you’ll be able to catch regular laser-lightning shows in the night sky due to an eye-popping price tag: The system used in the experiment costs $2.17 billion.—SK

Good morning. Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Not only is it a federal holiday to honor the legacy of Dr. King, but it’s also the only federal holiday to be designated as a National Day of Service. So let this be a nudge to roll up your sleeves and get active in your local community—you can make a positive difference.

As more students realize that ChatGPT can write five-paragraph essays equally as good as—if not significantly better than—what they’re capable of, teachers are scrambling for tools that can detect whether they’re grading the writing of a young human or a young robot.

Several cheating-detection tools have sprung up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VWT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2d3c7817> in the few months since ChatGPT, a conversational language model from OpenAI, arrived on the scene. The most-talked about one is GPTZero <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VWj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cea1ab833>, which was developed by, of all people…a student.

Over winter break, 22-year-old Princeton student Edward Tian created an app that determines the likelihood that a piece of text was written by a human or by ChatGPT. While it probably didn’t make him the most popular dude on campus, the app is getting more than 7 million views as of last week.

Apps like GPTZero are becoming increasingly sought after as older cheating detection tools become obsolete in the ChatGPT era.

Remember Turnitin?

Many of us who’ve been tasked with explaining the green light at the end of The Great Gatsby have had to submit those essays to Turnitin.com to make sure we didn’t copy it from Wikipedia. That was effective…before ChatGPT. But what makes ChatGPT different is that it theoretically creates an original response of text every time you query it. That’s not what Turnitin is designed for: It cross-checks your work against an existing database of writing.

Turnitin, of course, is on the case: It says it’s currently testing a tool that can detect AI-generated text, and plans to open it up to the public later this year.

But as good as these apps get, ChatGPT and its fellow language models will also evolve—and some education experts say teachers will have to also rely on the oldest tool in the book to mitigate cheating: their noggin. Teachers will need to understand the differences (which do exist) between AI and human writing. They’ll also likely need to overhaul their teaching process <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VLT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C5273cf40> to minimize cheating opportunities—for instance, by setting clear expectations with students about the role of ChatGPT in classrooms, or by tweaking their assignments to reward skills ChatGPT hasn’t mastered…

On Friday, Boston city officials unveiled <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9WNj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd088ab19> the latest monument to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—a $10 million bronze sculpture depicting the moment MLK embraced his wife, Coretta Scott King, after Dr. King learned he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It is called The Embrace.

The completion of the 22-foot-tall statue was highly anticipated: Five years in the works, it is the largest monument to racial equity in the country, and it’s located in the Boston Common, the oldest public park in the US.

Why Boston? That was where MLK met Coretta: He was a doctoral student at BU, while she was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. Boston Common was also the final destination of a 20,000-person-strong voting rights march Dr. King led from Roxbury in 1955.

But The Embrace hasn’t exactly been embraced <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9WNz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C23e86aaa> from a critical POV. The design of the statue, which shows four arms intertwined, was bashed online for not depicting the couple in full and for potentially giving off inappropriate vibes. Corretta Scott King’s cousin, Seneca Scott, wrote in the online journal Compact, “Ten million dollars were wasted to create a masturbatory metal homage to my legendary family members.”

The artist’s vision: Brooklyn-based sculptor Hank Willis Thomas told the Boston Globe <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30260530.3516230/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9WOD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjYwNTMwLjM1MTYyMzA/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd5acce8e>, “This work is really about the capacity for each of us to be enveloped in love.”

This photo captures the mesmerizing spectacle of the world-famous ice fishing contest in Hwacheon, South Korea, which has historically drawn more than 1 million visitors annually (though it was paused for three years due to the pandemic). The festival is located just 12 miles from the Demilitarized Zone that separates South Korea from its northern neighbor.

Cancer prevention is working. Overall mortality from cancer <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9QWj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C3ec60548> has plunged by a third since 1991, according to a new report by the American Cancer Society. The drop, which the organization estimates has resulted in 3.8 million cancer deaths avoided, reflects improvements to cancer screening and prevention. For instance, cervical cancer rates for women in their early twenties dropped 65% following the introduction of the HPV vaccine. But there’s still more work to do: Rates of prostate cancer, which is the second largest cause of cancer death for US men, have started climbing and cases are frequently being caught in later stages.

But this one’s probably not a candidate to be our new digs if Elon Musk’s plans for Mars don’t pan out—the planet, named LHS 475 b, orbits a red dwarf star a whole lot closer than we do the sun, making it at least 200 degrees hotter than Earth. Still, the newbie adds to the list of 5,000+ exoplanets NASA has found so far.

They’ll both speak at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting in Davos this week, as economic and political elites from around the globe gather in the Swiss Alps to drink Glühwein in a ski lodge brainstorm solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.

According to the WEF <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C42260562>, these are: climate change, inflation, confrontation between countries, threats from technology, plus the prospect of these issues combining into a “polycrisis” (like wars over scarce natural resources brought about by climate change).

What happens in Davos every year is pretty straightforward: World leaders, billionaires, heads of international NGOs, celebrities, and Nobel laureates rub elbows behind closed doors. Meanwhile, journalists lurk around, hoping to catch them in a talkative mood.

But does the WEF really achieve anything besides organizing a glitzy get-together in Europe’s highest town?

First, what is the WEF?

It’s a not-for-profit foundation that’s been around since 1971. It aims to bring together the world’s most influential people to “shape global, regional, and industry agendas.” Aside from the flagship Davos event, it runs regional summits and publishes thought leadership on economic and social issues.

The WEF’s efforts center on stakeholder capitalism, the idea that corporations should not just be profit-maximizing machines but should also look out for customers, suppliers, and local communities.

Not everyone is a fan of the Alpine ski squad

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that an organization in the business of setting up schmooze fests for the global elite has more than a few critics.

Davos skeptics note that the WEF is funded by basically every major organization under the sun. Its 2022 annual report says over half of the ~$413 million it brought in that year came from its partners, mostly corporations like Nestlé and government-run entities like the Agricultural Bank of China. It’s been accused of engaging in capitalist virtue signaling while making it easier for sponsors to lobby for their interests and advocate for business-friendly policies.

The “Great Reset” initiative, the foundation’s global post-pandemic recovery plan, has been panned as a thinly veiled effort to tip the power balance in solving global issues away from governments and toward the private sector.

Why this all matters to those without a private jet

The WEF shapes the conversation (and policies) in areas like international food security and global vaccine distribution:

* It’s a prominent supplier of narratives to news organizations, with last year’s Davos meeting getting 48,000 media mentions (and it’s already notched at least one this year).

* Its influence transcends legacy media: Popular journalist Johnny Harris was once called out <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C972d107f> for partnering with the WEF to promote shareholder capitalism on his YouTube channel.

Big picture: Curiously enough, this year’s Davos attendees nearly showed up to a ski resort without the ability to ski, as an unusually warm winter has left European mountains with little snow. It did snow in Davos at the last minute, but whether the WEF’s efforts can help blunt the impacts of climate change (or solve any other problems) remains to be seen. The WEF’s ability to produce vague proclamations and viral Greta Thunberg moments <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30246160.3484633/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9RZj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjQ2MTYwLjM0ODQ2MzM/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf1ac448c>, however, is certainly beyond question.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Melbourne, Australia Australia Open venue in Melbourne Graham Denholm/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

While it may not be Australia’s largest city, Melbourne is the country’s hub for all things food, culture, arts, and sports—and starting tomorrow it’ll be the center of the tennis universe for the next two weeks when it hosts the Australian Open.

As you watch tennis players rally in the warm sun (it is summer Down Under, after all), you should know that outside the courts, there’s a metropolis of 5+ million people with some unique characteristics, starting with the city’s design. Melbourne’s central business district (CBD) is laid out in a grid, but tucked behind the major thoroughfares are “laneways” that in the Victorian era serviced the businesses on the main roads. It’s on these narrow streets that you can find some of the cafes, boutiques, restaurants, and street art that Melbourne is known for.

Some other fun facts:

* Melbourne is sports-mad. Not only does it host the Australian Open, but also a Formula 1 race and other international events. Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity: 100,000+) is one of the most famous sports venues in the world. And in 1956 Melbourne became the first city outside of Europe or North America to host the Olympics.

* Vegemite, that foul spread Australians like to eat with bread, is manufactured in Melbourne and the product turns 100 years old this year.

* In the 2010s, Melbourne was declared the most livable city in the world for seven straight years by the Economist Intelligence Unit. —NF

Our favorite responses:

“In 2023, Merriam-Webster’s Word of the Year will be ‘artificial.’ AI will continue to make us ask questions about content like the ones we’ve been asking about our food: ‘This isn’t butter?’ ‘Yogurt?’ ‘This is meat? IMPOSSIBLE!’ Prince Harry’s Spare will expose the phoniness of the monarchy. Elon Musk will continue to make bots scapegoats. And making daylight saving time permanent will help us all realize how artificial anything can be—even time.”—Luke from Atlanta, GA

“‘Sus,’ because everything is.”—Brandie from Arkansas

“ChatGPT. Why? Because the phrase ‘ChatGPT it’ will replace the phrase ‘Google it’ as the means to obtain unknowns via the internet.”—Heather

Good morning and Happy Saturday. Our fantastic design team was out at a summit yesterday, which left the inmates (us) to run the asylum (image selection for the newsletter).

When deciding which images to use for each story, Jamie jokingly floated the idea of using Simpsons GIFs for all of them. At first we laughed, but then thought…why the heck not? So, for no particular reason, we did.

Thank you most of all to Matt Groening for providing an infinite library of timeless scenes to choose from.

The sky began to slowly descend on Washington as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen kicked off the fight over the debt ceiling yesterday.

Yellen said that if lawmakers don’t raise the cap on government borrowing, the Treasury will start taking “extraordinary measures,” like pausing contributions to federal workers’ retirement funds, on Thursday.

So, what is all the fuss about? In order for the US to keep borrowing and paying its bills, lawmakers have to agree on a new debt ceiling. Currently the US is $78 billion away from maxing out the current $31.4 trillion limit (similar to your credit card sitch after the holiday season).

This is something Congress needs to do, but lawmakers have come to view the procedure as a bargaining chip. The negotiation is expected to be epic:

Ultraconservative Republicans only handed Rep. Kevin McCarthy the House speakership on the condition that a new borrowing limit gets coupled with deep cuts to government spending and a plan to balance the budget in the next decade. (According to the Washington Post, they’ve already prepared a plan for default.)

The White House insists that the new debt limit must be passed with no strings attached.

While the government can probably scrape by on the cash it has until early June, all the drama has people thinking about what defaulting for real would be like. Well, the reputation of the US as a borrower would start to resemble that of an unemployed uncle with a gambling addiction. Financial markets would likely enter a tailspin and the US economy would tank.

How do we avert the disaster?

Lawmakers have to reach a compromise. It could involve negotiations between top House Republicans and the White House, or the House entering a more protracted procedure that entails convincing moderate Republicans to vote with Democrats.

But if the traditional route doesn’t work, policy nerds have some workarounds (that are not Yellen-approved). One is minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin to meet the Treasury’s financial obligations.

Bottom line: While an unprecedented default on US government debt remains a remote possibility, some parts of the bond market (which holds government debt) are already angsty and preparing for a long congressional fight.—SK

Though bank lending is looking profitable right now thanks to higher interest rates, the institutions said they were socking away more cash than analysts expected to cover loan defaults in preparation for a recession. Both JPMorgan and Bank of America indicated that they anticipate the downturn will be a “mild” one but that they have to prepare for the worst anyway. They’re also probably psyched not to be Goldman Sachs, which hasn’t reported earnings yet but revealed that it lost $3 billion on its attempts to serve consumers since 2020.

Leopard lost and found. The Dallas Zoo was closed yesterday after it discovered that a clouded leopard named Nova was not in her enclosure. Luckily, Nova—who despite sounding fearsome was described by officials as only 30 pounds and no threat to humans—was located near the enclosure hours later, and preliminarily found to be unharmed. Though zoo officials had faith she’d be found close to her home, Dallas police opened an investigation into the potential involvement of a cat burglar after determining that the leopard’s enclosure was intentionally cut rather than torn.

For a revolutionary tech company, Tesla is starting to act a lot like your average car manufacturer. After missing year-end delivery goals, the company slashed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30250159.3068198/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VcD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjUwMTU5LjMwNjgxOTg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cda25b213> its vehicle prices in the US and Europe Thursday.

The details: Tesla fell short getting cars into garages despite pulling out all the stops to move its vehicles in December, including $7,500 discounts and the promise of free charging. And this week it went even further and announced another round of price cuts, some as high as ~20%, to goose sales. The lower pricing also made more versions of its popular Model Y SUV eligible for Biden’s $7,500 EV tax credit.

What does this mean? The company that once bragged about its long waitlist now has too many vehicles sitting around collecting dust. Which isn’t great when you consider the 65% nosedive Tesla’s stock took last year thanks to supply chain problems, skyrocketing interest rates, the EV market becoming more saturated, and Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter ordeal.

Bottom line: Investors are getting nervous. Tesla will report its 2022 Q4 earnings January 25.—MM

National intelligence officials cataloged hundreds of new sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena since last year, according to the unclassified version <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30250159.3068198/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9VdT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjUwMTU5LjMwNjgxOTg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C80513ad8> of a government report released Thursday. The report is part of a growing effort by the US government to investigate UFOs as a legit scientific and national security matter—not a conspiracy theory.

Some other nuggets from the report:

Over 366 sightings out of 510 total have been added to the government’s list since last year; more than half have been deemed “unremarkable” and “clutter,” and their self-confidence is now shattered. Many were just balloons and drones.

But 171 are special and have “demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities,” like little Tony Hawks of the sky.

Officials have said, repeatedly, that there’s no reason to suspect Kang and Kodos or any other aliens of operating the UFOs—but they also haven’t ruled it out.

Good morning. It’s once again time to revive the quarterly practice of lighting $50 on fire because the lottery jackpot got high enough to make it seem like a smart idea. After 25 whiffs over three months of drawings, the Mega Millions jackpot has risen to $1.35 billion, which is good for the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in history. The next drawing will be held Friday night.

The FAA created air travel chaos yesterday that highlights outdated tech in aviation again after a key bit of its software glitched harder than a Grand Theft Auto NPC. The agency grounded all flights in the morning over a problem it believes was caused by a “damaged database file,” renewing concerns that US travel infrastructure desperately needs an update.

This grounding is way bigger than when your parents realized the “cartoons” you rented from Blockbuster were hyperviolent anime: It may be the first time all flights have been ordered to stay on the tarmac since 9/11. Departures resumed at 9am ET, but as of yesterday evening, 10,000+ US flights were delayed and 1,300 were canceled as airlines struggled to sort out the morning mayhem <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9FdT9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C9eb7c460>.

Delays and cancellations could go on for days…meaning this MLK weekend could give deja vu of late December, when Southwest had to cancel thousands of flights after its software couldn’t handle weather conditions disrupting its itineraries.

What exactly caused this mess?

The FAA system that went down was created over 75 years ago. It's called NOTAMs (formerly “Notice to Airmen,” now “Notice to Air Missions”), and it alerts pilots to any hazards along their route and at their destination—such as flocks of birds and icy runways. It was rebooted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Fdj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd36a7e25> yesterday morning after some corrupted data was discovered, and it took longer than AOL dial-up to get back online.

The government system has been criticized for *surprise, surprise* not being very modern, and the UN’s aviation body has been pushing to bring NOTAMs into the 21st century. A single briefing produced by the system can consist of up to 200 pages of alerts, and pilots have to review the whole document before takeoff.

Looking ahead…the FAA has preliminarily traced the issue back to a damaged file and said that it does not appear a cyber attack was involved, but, whatever occurred, the outage signals that the system’s outdatedness may run deeper than its HTML. “America’s transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades,” Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association president, said. He called on <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9Fdz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C64dcf877> policymakers to “modernize our vital air travel infrastructure.”—JW

It’s likely to put pressure on other companies during their annual spring pay negotiations, even if most won’t offer such a large increase.

Not satisfied with simply taking Elon Musk’s top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bernard Arnaut is also taking plot lines from HBO. The world’s richest person and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH named his daughter, Delphine Arnault, CEO of the fashion house Dior, setting up <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30223741.3062455/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9FRD9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjIzNzQxLjMwNjI0NTU/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C769625df> a sibling battle for succession of his company.

Analysts see the move as a Logan Roy/George Bluth-eseque attempt to pit sibling against sibling, as Arnault’s son Antoine was named CEO of the holding company that controls the family fortune in December.

Luxury goods seem to be a passion for all of Arnault’s five children, as they all work for the company in various executive positions across its brands. Probably safe to assume there’s a Tom Wambsgans analog eating birds under a cloth in the mix, too.

But, like Succession, we may have to wait a few seasons to see how this all shakes out. LVMH recently changed its bylaws to increase the maximum age for a CEO to 80 (from 75)—an apparent sign that the 73-year-old Arnault patriarch isn’t planning on stepping down soon.

The power of nepotism: A surge in the share price of LVMH—Europe’s most valuable company—helped push the combined value of companies listed in Paris above those listed in London in November.—MK

Instead, South Korea’s Samsung got the most, while IBM came in at No. 2.

The two go-getters can’t fetch anyone coffee, but they have already named themselves Aiko and Aiden and created their own uncanny valley-dwelling self-portraits. Soon they’ll be terrifying all creative industry workers by taking on tasks like creating concept images for mood boards and even writing first drafts of internal content if they show promise.

A deadly barrage of storms has been dumping Olympic-sized pools of rain on California over the past few weeks. On Monday, millions across the state experienced an “atmospheric river” that dropped a month’s worth of rain in one day. And as the downpours continued yesterday, 90% of the state’s population (which equates to 10% of the entire US population) was under flood watch. Forecasters estimate more than 20 trillion gallons <Over%2020%20trillion%20gallons%20of%20water%20are%20expected%20to%20fall%20across%20California%20over%20the%20next%202%20weeks.%20> of water will have fallen on California by mid-January.

Surely all this water will cure the state of the devastating drought that’s parched it over the last few decades, right?

Not quite

In fact, most parts of California are simultaneously under drought and flood emergencies, a bizarre consequence of climate change that will likely stick around—despite more rainstorms projected to hit the state throughout the rest of the month.

Experts say California would need a lot more rain to completely reverse the drought that has put the Southwest in its driest condition in 1,200 years. One scientist told <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL25hdGlvbi8yMDIzLzAxLzA1L2NhbGlmb3JuaWEtZHJvdWdodC1yYWluLXN0b3JtLz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C18ef35f3> the WaPo that these storms are like getting a normal monthly paycheck after several months of not getting paid at all—the influx is welcome, but your bank account will still be depleted.

Another problem: Right now, there’s too much water and nowhere to put it. While California has gargantuan reservoirs to store rainwater and snow melt, most of the state has received rainfall anywhere from 400% to 600% above average since the storms began a few weeks ago. And once reservoirs are full, the water just flows into the ocean.

For instance, Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County was hovering around 30% capacity in early December. After rising 34 feet yesterday, it’s expected to start overflowing Friday or Saturday.

Plus, in cities like LA (which has received around three inches so far), rainwater can’t be collected because it’s been contaminated by road runoff.

The current state of the storms: Around 146,000 customers were left without power as of 7pm ET yesterday and the death toll has risen <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzEwL3dlYXRoZXIvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1mbG9vZGluZy1hdG1vc3BoZXJpYy1yaXZlci10dWVzZGF5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C018290c4> to 17.

The bank has been hit hard by the market downturn and dealmaking drying up, plus its highly anticipated plans to build a consumer business failed to find…any consumers. We’re sure CEO David Solomon will have more to say about his restructuring plan on Goldman’s earnings call next Tuesday.

Biden launches another student debt overhaul.

This proposal would change the rules of existing income-driven repayment plans to slash the payments millions of borrowers need to make on their loans by more than 50%, allowing them to pay off their debt more quickly. As for the broader student loan cancellation plan, the Supreme Court is expected to hear the case next month.

France could make you work longer, and unions are angry. The French government released plans to gradually raise the age of retirement <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzEwL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZyYW5jZS1wZW5zaW9uLXJlZm9ybT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C2a36958d> by two years, to 64, in the hopes it’ll boost employment among seniors and put funds back into its strained pension system. But French unions, which staged massive protests the last time this plan was floated, have already made plans to strike on Jan. 19 in opposition to the move, which they call unjustified. Even at 64, the retirement age in France would still be lower than it is in other higher-income countries.

What’s in it for Microsoft? The company has already invested $1 billion in OpenAI, but thinks an even tighter relationship would help it better compete with Big Tech rivals like Google (which reportedly declared a “code red <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FpLWNoYXRncHQtZ29vZ2xlLXNlYXJjaC5odG1sP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C28fc1b8f>” over ChatGPT’s threat to its search engine).

So, what is OpenAI? It was founded in 2015 as a mission-based AI research organization by a roster from Silicon Valley’s A-list, including Elon Musk. Its stated goal is to develop safe AI for the benefit of humanity.

But OpenAI has plenty of critics who have called it out for ethical concerns, a lack of transparency, and abandoning its mission for profits.

As tractors have evolved to include high-tech features like self-driving capabilities, GPS, obstacle detection, and—soon, with any luck—League of Legends compatibility, they’ve become increasingly difficult for farmers or third-party shops to repair. But on Sunday, John Deere committed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kZWVyZS10by1hbGxvdy1mYXJtZXJzLXRvLXJlcGFpci10aGVpci1vd24tZXF1aXBtZW50LTExNjczMjI4NTgwP3V0bV9jb250ZW50PWJ1ZmZlcjE3MjdlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09c29jaWFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9dHdpdHRlci5jb20mdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWJ1ZmZlcg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C72d00aa8> to making that easier.

Together with the American Farm Bureau Federation, the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that’s aimed at providing farmers with greater access to tools, diagnostic codes, and manuals. Until now, the company’s high-tech tractors could only be repaired by authorized dealers due to software locks, which farmers claimed raised costs and caused delays (and even led to some farmers hacking <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30212721.3059397/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW1lcmdpbmd0ZWNoYnJldy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLzA5LzIwL2pvaG4tZGVlcmUtcy1kaWdpdGFsLWVtYnJhY2UtcHV0cy1hLXNwb3RsaWdodC1vbi1pdHMtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS1wcmFjdGljZXM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWV0YiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXcmbWlkPTdjZDNkN2VmY2IyYjVkMWE2Y2JlMGJmMDkzMWY0YjJm/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C4799e80c> their tractors).

While this represents a victory for the burgeoning right-to-repair movement, advocates are wary of the MOU’s lack of enforcement measures and certain sections in the agreement, including one that gives John Deere (or the AFBF) the ability to withdraw from the deal if any federal or state right-to-repair legislation is enacted.

Zoom out: This isn’t the first time a deal like this has been made in the private sector. In 2018, a similar agreement was reached between a lobbying group representing Deere and the California Farm Bureau, but many of the promises didn’t come to pass.—MK

Powell has heard from critics in both directions that the Fed should play a larger (or smaller) role in promoting environmental sustainability in the financial world.

Good morning. What can you expect from Super Bowl commercials this year? Less crypto, more Gronk. FanDuel announced yesterday that in an ad during the game, Rob Gronkowski will kick a 25-yard field goal live. If he makes it, anyone who placed a Super Bowl bet of $5 or more on FanDuel will split $10 million in free bets on the platform.

A bit of good news for the Earthlings reading this: The ozone’s layer is set to be fully restored <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zND9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C0728e10a> over most of the world within the next two decades, according to a new UN report.

Trends indicate a full ozone layer recovery by 2040 will take place across the planet, excluding the poles: Ozone bounce back (to 1980, precrisis levels) over the Arctic is expected by 2045, and over the Antarctic by 2066. So keep holding, South Pole property owners, good times are just over the horizon.

So, why does it matter?

Science class refresher:

The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth’s stratosphere, about nine to 18 miles above its surface. This layer shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays linked to cancers and crop damage. In 1985, scientists identified a hole in the ozone layer caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the ozone-depleting chemicals found in air conditioners, refrigerators, and deodorants.

The loss of the ozone layer was one of the most feared environmental issues through most of the 1980s and ’90s, culminating in a poetic reference in Smash Mouth’s 1999 banger “All Star.” Perhaps due to the easily digestible urgency of the problem (a hole that was getting bigger), an international agreement to phase out CFCs known as the Montreal Protocol was reached quickly in 1987.

And, despite a few hiccups—including a 2018 discovery that factories in China were emitting large amounts of banned chemicals—the Montreal Protocol has proven successful. Yesterday’s report found that the primary ozone-depleting gasses in the stratosphere were on the decline from their peaks:

Chlorine decreased 11.5% from its peak in 1993.

Bromine decreased 14.5% from its peak in 1999.

In a bit of a full circle moment, the defunct Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, which helped confirm the ozone layer’s decline in the ’80s, fell back to Earth on Sunday night.—MK

When companies need to ship freight, they call a trucking company, right? Wrong! 

They call a broker to hire a trucking company. These middlemen rake in $200b annually by charging up to 50% commissions, which drives up your product costs and shrinks truck drivers’ revenue.

The declaration will allow federal agencies to coordinate relief efforts as atmospheric rivers and cyclones keep pummeling the northern part of the state.

Unlike the documents that were seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, however, it appears that Biden’s own attorneys found them and alerted the government, returning them the next day. In other political news yesterday, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy made it through the first test in his hard-won speakership when the House passed the rules it will operate under, as well as a bill rescinding new funding for the IRS that’s unlikely to succeed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Windsor watchers who have yet to overdose on British monarchy drama are queuing up at their nearest bookstore. Prince Harry’s memoir, Spare, hits shelves <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zYz9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cd36a024f> today and bombshell pre-release leaks suggest that it’s a juicy one (we already know more than we want to about royal circumcision).

Royalties for royalty

Celebrity narratives are big business: A four-book deal (allegedly) earned Harry and his wife Meghan up to $40 million. And though literary accolades are likely not on the horizon for Prince Harry (or his ghostwriter), Spare already clinched the No. 1 bestseller spot at both Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

Its publisher, Random House, says it printed 2.5 million copies for North America, betting at least that many readers will be willing to shell out $25 to get further details on how Harry lost his virginity in a field, behind a pub.

Zoom out: Harry and Meghan have not shied away from getting paid to publicly air grievances with family members turning themselves into a powerful media brand after walking away from royal duties. Together they launched a Spotify podcast and a Netflix docuseries. It’s no doubt made them bank, but it’s also made Prince Harry less popular—at least in the UK, where his approval ratings plummeted the most with older people who tend to support the monarchy, according to a recent YouGov poll.—SK

Its creator and head chef, René Redzepi, told the NYT that the way fine dining currently operates is “unsustainable.”

If you couldn’t relate to anyone in The Menu except Margot and wouldn’t shell out $500 for a meal, here’s why this is a BFD:

The Copenhagen-based restaurant has three Michelin stars and has topped the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list so many times (five) that it became ineligible to nab No. 1 again.

Redzepi, who’s been called the greatest chef of his time, co-created “New Nordic” cuisine—which highlights the naturalness of foraged ingredients. If you’ve ever been served an entree on a log, that’s Noma’s influence.

But a lot of unpaid interns had to tweeze fruit leather into the shape of a beetle (seriously <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30200055.3066282/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy9zaj9taWQ9N2NkM2Q3ZWZjYjJiNWQxYTZjYmUwYmYwOTMxZjRiMmYmY2lkPTMwMjAwMDU1LjMwNjYyODI/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C44cd9237>) to get Noma to the top. Grueling hours, low pay, and a workplace culture that would get zero stars on Glassdoor has become the norm in fine dining restaurants.

Redzepi told the NYT, “Financially and emotionally, as an employer and as a human being, it just doesn’t work.”

Looking ahead…in 2024, Noma will be converted into a culinary lab where Redzepi will pickle and ferment foods we’ve never heard of.—JW

Last week’s historic, bare-knuckle brawl to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker was a sign that in this 118th Congress, we’ve ain’t seen nothing yet. Concerns grew over the weekend that the chaos and brinkmanship that characterized the 15-round speaker vote could foreshadow nasty infighting <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3VzLXBvbGljeS8yMDIzLzAxLzA3L2dvcC1idWRnZXQtZGVidC1saW1pdC1rZXZpbi1tY2NhcnRoeS8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C78246370> around the biggest legislative issues of the year.

After all, electing a House speaker in just one ballot has been mostly a foregone conclusion since the Civil War. So if you can barely dice the onions, how are you supposed to make the entire chili?

The No. 1 issue: debt ceiling

The biggest challenge for Congress to tackle in 2023 is raising the debt ceiling <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8wNy91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9zcGVha2VyLWVsZWN0aW9uLWRlYnQtbGltaXQtcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMuaHRtbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bW9ybmluZ19icmV3/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1d75b5cf>.

What is the debt ceiling? It’s a limit on what the US government can borrow to pay its bills. And since the government runs on budget deficits, it regularly needs to borrow more money to avoid a credit default, which would be a disastrous scenario. Should a potential default materialize due to congressional paralysis, it could crater global markets and plunge the US into a recession.

So, what’s the status? In 2021, Congress raised the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion—but that will only get us to August, when Goldman Sachs predicts that lawmakers will need to raise the roof again to avert a default.

Here’s where the McCarthy vote comes into play: The small faction of hardline Republicans who held up McCarthy’s election as speaker could, in effect, hold the debt ceiling “hostage” by getting their demands—specifically, spending cuts to domestic programs and the military—into any debt limit bill. Given their outsized leverage in the Republican Party’s slim majority in the House, this group could bring debt ceiling negotiations perilously close to the expiration date, which is worrying economists over the downstream effects on markets.

Looking ahead…the concerns about gridlock may become real starting today, when the House will vote on a rules package that determines how the chamber will operate during its term. Some Republicans expressed hesitation <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy9qYW4vMDgva2V2aW4tbWNjYXJ0aHktaG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci1uZXh0LWZpZ2h0LXJ1bGVzLXBhY2thZ2U_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cad4ff5ce> this weekend about approving these rules due to the still unknown concessions McCarthy must have granted the hardline faction to secure his speaker seat.

Many called for the removal of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sworn in last week, piggybacking on Bolsonaro’s baseless attacks on the legitimacy of October’s election. Leaders across the world, including in the US, condemned the riots as undemocratic. Security forces said they took back control of the buildings.

Biden at the border. President Biden made his first visit <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvam9lLWJpZGVuL2JpZGVuLW1ha2VzLWZpcnN0LXRyaXAtcHJlc2lkZW50LXVzLW1leGljby1ib3JkZXItYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24taW1wb3MtcmNuYTY0ODA4P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Ce38361c0> to the US–Mexico border while in office yesterday as he toughens up restrictions on the record number of asylum-seekers coming into the country. Biden has been criticized by Republicans for not doing enough to secure the border, while he’s attacked opponents for not passing his own immigration proposal. After his visit to the border in El Paso, TX, Biden left for Mexico City, where he’ll attend a summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.

Travelers still need to show a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of entering China, but that’s nothing compared to the up to three weeks of isolation that were imposed on visitors during the pandemic. The tens of thousands of people traveling to and from Hong Kong yesterday cheered the opportunity to see loved ones again.

The “robot” is actually an artificial intelligence algorithm created by the company DoNotPay. It’ll run on a smartphone located in the defendant’s pocket and, through an earpiece, will advise them on what to say after hearing the arguments presented during the hearing.

DoNotPay is keeping the specifics of its “experiment” mostly under wraps, since what it’s doing violates courtroom protocol, but we do know the hearing involves a speeding charge <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30190372.3054878/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXptb2RvLmNvbS9kb25vdHBheS1zcGVlZGluZy10aWNrZXQtY2hhdGdwdC0xODQ5OTYwMjcyP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C135ff807>. Interestingly, no one in court other than the defendant will know that an AI lawyer is even involved (DoNotPay will use a hearing accessibility loophole to get the defendant to wear AirPods).

DoNotPay said it’ll cover any fines or fees incurred by the defendant if its AI gets stage fright in court or if they otherwise lose the challenge.

Big picture: Recent breakthroughs in AI have some of us worried about robots taking our jobs—are lawyers on the chopping block? Maybe not yet, but in a test from 2018, a machine-learning AI topped human attorneys when analyzing NDAs for risks.

Most people don’t toast to government data on a Friday night, but a report on the job market that dropped yesterday inspired cautious optimism: There might be a way out of our current inflation hellscape without bringing the economy to the brink of collapse after all.

The big numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics report:

The unemployment rate dropped <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMDEtMDYvdXMtaGlyaW5nLXRvcHMtZm9yZWNhc3RzLWpvYmxlc3MtcmF0ZS1mYWxscy1hcy13YWdlLWdhaW5zLXNsb3c_c3JlZj1La1B6cFp2eg/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C1e3d2005> to 3.5%, the lowest it’s been in 50 years.

The US added 223,000 nonfarm jobs in December. Though job growth slowed from the previous month, the labor market is still going strong.

In 2022, 4.5 million total jobs were added, compared with 6.7 million in 2021.

But the number that really got people talking was the lower-than-expected month over month wage growth, which slowed to .3% in December and 4.6% annually.

While that might not sound like welcome news to anyone who doesn’t live off a fortune inherited from their robber baron granddad, the folks at the Federal Reserve are most certainly pleased. Rapidly growing paychecks are seen as one of the key drivers of inflation, which the Fed has been trying to tame with aggressive interest rate hikes since early last year.

Economists have dubbed the jobs data a “Goldilocks” situation—not too hot, and not too cold. Since the labor shortage and the strident wage growth it drove seem to be abating, the hope is that inflation will continue to decline. At the same time, a strong labor market (fingers crossed) might just allow the economy to avoid a recession caused by the interest rate increases.

Zoom out: Experts expect slowing wage growth to signal to the Fed that it’s time to chill with the aggressive rate hikes. And it’s not just speculation: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said yesterday that he’d lean toward just a 25 basis point increase (as opposed to 50 basis points) for the next interest rate hike if the labor market continues to cool.—SK

The final weekend of the NFL’s regular season is typically among the most exciting dates on the sports calendar each year, featuring high-stakes games where teams jockey for playoff spots and higher seeds in the postseason.

And that’ll happen again today when Week 18 kicks off, albeit under the giant cloud of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest during a game Monday—a horrific injury that has shaken players, coaches, and fans of the game.

Hamlin update: He had his breathing tube removed <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmZsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzUzOTE4MTIvYmlsbHMtZGFtYXItaGFtbGluLWJyZWF0aGluZy1vd24tdHViZS1yZW1vdmVkP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7378db86> and has been talking and FaceTiming with family and his teammates. “I love you, boys,” he told his fellow Bills players yesterday.

Meanwhile, the NFL has announced a few tributes and changes in light of the incident:

Teams have been given a number of options to support Hamlin, including painting “3” (his jersey number) in Bills colors on their 30-yard line.

After canceling the Bills–Bengals game in which Hamlin collapsed, the NFL unveiled a complex set of scenarios for the playoffs, which include the AFC Championship Game potentially being played at a neutral site.

In the biggest scandal to hit Facebook since we got banned for offering a bag of half-eaten tortilla chips in our neighborhood Buy Nothing group, indie romance author Susan Meachen posted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnV6emZlZWRuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2tlbHNleXdlZWttYW4vc3VzYW4tbWVhY2hlbi1hdXRob3ItYWxsZWdlZC1kZWF0aC1ob2F4P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tYiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1tb3JuaW5nX2JyZXc/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C65d66de9> that she’s actually alive.

She faked her own death for over two years. Meachen is/was/??? known in the romance writing world for self-publishing over a dozen books and running a successful niche Facebook group. In 2020, a post supposedly written by her daughter claimed that she had died by suicide because of bullying from other authors.

Then, on Monday, Meachen posted in the same Facebook group that was used to announce her death that she was alive and ready to start writing again, ending her post with “Let the fun begin.”

While her friends and fans were glad to find out she was alive, they were also horrified. Some asked where the money they crowdfunded for funeral costs went. After Meachen’s supposed death, the community even edited her final novel for free and helped promote it in her honor.

What the twist? No one’s quite sure why Meachen did this. The only explanation she offered in her post was, “My family did what they thought was best for me.”—MM

Pickleball is also becoming a big business, attracting investors like LeBron James and Tom Brady and sponsors like Anheuser-Busch and Skechers.

Troy Haase, the fire chief of Portage, Wisconsin, might switch to margarine after the experience his team had fighting a fire <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30179621.3048557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy9qYW4vMDUvYnV0dGVyLXdpc2NvbnNpbi1kYWlyeS1wbGFudC1jYW5hbC1tZWx0ZWQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2Cf8d6f094> at a dairy plant this week. The fire started in the facility’s butter storage room, sending melted butter flowing “three inches thick” down the stairs that led to it—which firefighters struggled to crawl up while hanging onto a slippery hose. Nobody was hurt in the blaze, but the butter river did make its way into storm drains, clogging a historic canal.

Good morning. The US House of Representatives still does not have a speaker since a small faction of rebels in the Republican party keep blocking Rep. Kevin McCarthy from securing the 218 votes needed to clinch the position.

And after going 0–11 in votes so far, McCarthy is racking up a losing streak that’s verging on Process-era Philadelphia 76ers territory. In fact, the only times the House has needed more ballots to choose a speaker was before the Civil War.

Will today be the day for a breakthrough, or just another scene from Groundhog Day? We’ll find out when the House reconvenes at noon ET today.

We’ll get the clearest sense of the labor market this morning, when the government drops December’s jobs report. US employers are expected to have added 200,000 jobs last month.

The potential rule would ban noncompete agreements, a common mechanism used by companies to keep employees from jumping ship and working for competitors.

It’s been a long time coming

In a 2021 executive order, President Biden asked the FTC (led by antitrust shark Lina Khan) to target noncompetes. And the proposal the agency came up with flexes more muscle than it has in the past: The plan would make all new and existing noncompetes illegal, as well as require companies to inform employees that any previous noncompete agreements are void.

Why are noncompetes a thing? They’re pitched as a way to protect trade secrets so someone working at Domino’s doesn’t leave and design a pizza tracker app for Pizza Hut (okay, not a bad idea). But as noncompetes have flooded industries across the board, the FTC—and even the Treasury Department <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30167710.3067832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMtcGF5LXdvcmtlcnMtbGVzcy10aGFuLXdvcnRoLWJpZGVuLXdhbnRzLXRvLWNoYW5nZS0yMDIyLTM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1iJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW1vcm5pbmdfYnJldw/62b63bd3ff8136015c0bece2C7b584225>—say these clauses are essentially trapping workers in lower wages. Putting an end to the practice could boost wages by $300 billion every year, and release workers from career inertia, per the FTC.

Noncompetes are truly everywhere: In one high-profile case in 2016, Jimmy John’s settled a lawsuit with the Illinois state attorney general’s office, saying it would not enforce its noncompete that barred workers from making subs (and sub-adjacents) within a three-mile radius of any JJ shops for two years. As if Jersey Mike’s would even need those dry sandwich secrets.

Looking ahead…the FTC’s 3–1 vote in favor of the proposed rule is the first step of the agency’s rulemaking process. Next up is 60 days of public comment. But there’s no date set for a final vote, and the plan is sure to face challenges even if it does cross the finish line. The US Chamber of Commerce—which represents a lot of big, powerful corporations—threatened legal action against such a change in 2021.—MM

BBBY expects to report a 33% sales decline compared to Q3 last year (which included Black Friday). The company anticipates losses to reach $385.8 million—a 40% spike from last year—and warned that it may not have cash for suppliers and lease agreements in the coming months. In response, shares fell to their lowest level in ~30 years, marking a 96% decline from the stock’s recent peak during its period in the memestock limelight (more on that in a bit).

What happened? Maybe shoppers are just less impressed by towels these days. But more likely the retailer also committed a self-own by replacing big brands with private labels amid supply chain snarls and at a time when pandemic-era shoppers wanted to shell out for a Kitchen-Aid. Sales fell flat due to supply chain issues and underinvestment in the BBBY website.

Meanwhile, sales of alcoholic beer and wine have declined year over year, and alcoholic spirit sales grew less than 1% annually.

That’s not to say people are teetotaling. Actually, over eight in 10 people who buy nonalcoholic drinks also buy alcoholic drinks. Plus, the nonalcoholic drinks sector, despite its recent growth, is a shot glass to Big Alcohol’s das boot, with the former representing a tiny 0.47% of the broader buzzed industry.—JW

These astronomical prices were fueled by three uber-expensive gene therapies approved by the FDA—one of them, from Hemgenix, costs $3.5 million, making it the most expensive drug ever. Congress did cap annual drug price increases via the Inflation Reduction Act, but that doesn’t cover the cost of new medications. Drugmakers, meanwhile, say the cost of their drugs doesn’t reflect what patients pay out-of-pocket for them.

Last year, the retailer warned that increased theft (or “shrinkage,” in industry terms) would account for a meaty 3.5% of sales, so it hired private security guards and barricaded toiletries like they were the “Mona Lisa.” But apparently the level of shrinkage hasn’t been significant and those guards weren’t effective, so it’s winding down its use of private security companies.

This is an unusual paragraph. I’m curious as to just how quickly you can find out what is so unusual about it. It looks so ordinary and plain that you would think nothing was wrong with it. In fact, nothing is wrong with it! It is highly unusual though. Study it and think about it. You still may not find anything odd. But if you work at it a bit, you might find out. Try to do so without any coaching.
