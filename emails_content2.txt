Good morning. The NFL is back tonight and your fantasy team, “Stroudy with a Chance of Deep Balls,” is looking dangerous. Nothing can go wrong this season.

Also, we wanted to shout out the hundreds of you who emailed answers to yesterday’s math question on how many points the Oregon Ducks could have scored if the mascot did 546 pushups during Saturday’s game. While they actually scored 81 points in the game, there were many different solutions—every score between 46 and 89, in fact (thanks, Nick).

The most popular answer was 84 points all via touchdowns and extra points: 7+14+21…until 84.

The most creative answer was 59 points in which the Ducks started out with 15 safeties (two points each), kicked five field goals, and closed out the game with two touchdowns plus extra points. Sounds like you had a productive day at work, Menachem.

As one reader wrote, “Math is fun!” We agree. Have a great Thursday.

LABOR

The US hit its smallest-ever workplace gender gap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAb?mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Line chart shows narrowing workplace gender gap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAb?mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
Mother alert: Working women have made historic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAc?mblid=ffc61d811f6f&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> gains, and those with young children are leading the charge.

According to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics…

Workforce participation rates were 57.7% among women and 68.2% among men as of August. This 10.5 percentage-point difference is the narrowest it’s ever been.

For full-time work, the gender pay gap decreased to 16 cents in Q2—or women earning 84 cents for every dollar men earn—the smallest disparity on record (but still not a huge leap from 20 cents in 2002).

These catch-ups have been driven by women between 25 and 54 years old, whose labor participation rates are higher than ever and are outpacing men’s post-pandemic work rebounds. Remarkably, women’s largest increases in workforce participation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAd?mblid=6d462929942a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> came from mothers of children under five, who are working more now than they did in 2019, according to the Brookings Institution.

Taking the village

Many companies are trying to reinstate in-person work policies, which stand to jeopardize the remote work flexibility that allowed many mothers to do their jobs while at home with their kids. Compounded by the approaching end of pandemic-era childcare aid, working women’s labor peaks are at risk of plateauing—or worse.

More than 70,000 struggling daycare programs may shutter when federal aid stops flowing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAe?mblid=795b9a483606&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the end of the month, leaving the parents of 3.2 million children scrambling, according to estimates from the Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Since childcare often falls to mothers more than to fathers, experts fear that the widespread closure of daycare centers will lead to a pullback.

Over the childcare cliff: A mass exodus of working mothers could worsen labor shortages, cost US states $10.6 billion each year in tax and business revenue, and cause families to earn about $9 billion less each year, the Century Foundation estimates.—ML

Biden admin moves to block drilling on millions of wild Alaskan acres. The Interior Department proposed regulations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAC?mblid=3e1c31623305&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that would ban new oil and gas drilling in more than 40% of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska and cancel leases issued by the Trump administration that allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. What the proposal doesn’t do is cancel the recent approval of the $8 billion Willow oil project <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAD?mblid=b5dcb43e283d&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the same Alaskan wilderness, which Biden angered environmental groups by signing off on. If finalized, the new restrictions are likely to face a lawsuit from fossil fuel companies aiming to block them.

Hunter Biden to be indicted again this month. Prosecutors expect to seek a new indictment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAE?mblid=4b3ff6dcc35f&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against the president’s son on a gun charge by the end of September after a judge scuttled a plea deal in July. This likely means former President Donald Trump, who is facing multiple indictments of his own, won’t be the only candidate facing awkwardly timed legal disputes as the presidential election approaches (though President Biden himself is not involved in the case against Hunter Biden). A judge ruled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAF?mblid=b92e5e774dcc&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that two of Trump’s alleged co-conspirators in the Georgia election interference case should go to trial in October.

There’s another big storm brewing. For now, Lee is just a tropical storm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAG?mblid=e883075c9c9a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, but it’s expected to gain strength over the Atlantic Ocean and become a major hurricane, possibly a Category 4 with 150 mph winds. It’s too soon to say where exactly the storm will blow once it grows. It could hit the East Coast, Canada or islands in the Carribean— or it could remain out at sea. Lee is the 12th named storm this year in the Atlantic, where hurricane season usually peaks in mid-September. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts there may be as many as 21 this year.

Your sedan is probably eavesdropping.

Unless your ’67 Chevy is still truckin’, you’re probably at risk. The 25 vehicle brands analyzed, including Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford, failed to hit basic privacy standards, Mozilla found.

That means your car and the services you use in it, like GPS or satellite radio, can collect data that includes your contact info, race, or immigration status, and the systems also personal inferences about you based on where you go.

Nissan admitted that their vehicles collect data on drivers’ sex lives, but didn’t explain what data or how.

Tesla was the worst-ranked car brand in terms of privacy.

The fine print: Most major automakers’ privacy policies don’t have an opt-out choice, nor do they offer encryption for your data.

For the first time in nearly twenty years, The Rolling Stones will release a new original album <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bz-?mblid=b0d206deecc5&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>next month. And if the single released yesterday is any indication, rock-and-roll’s OG frontman, Mick Jagger—now an octogenarian—hasn’t missed a beat.

Ronnie Wood, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger announced their forthcoming album, Hackney Diamonds, yesterday in London along with their new song, “Angry <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bz_?mblid=53c572a7ee25&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.” At 76, 79, and 80, respectively, the Stones are just one example of how the makeup of the workforce <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bA0?mblid=5e6faa36eb30&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is grayer than you might think:

Last year, 650,000 Americans over 80 were still working, up 18% from the previous decade, according to data from the Census Bureau.

There will be twice as many 75-year-old+ workers in 2030 than 2020, due in part to the aging baby boomer generation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.

Can’t get no retirement: Apropos of the new album, Wood told the AP that retirement would be “impossible” because “you’ve got to keep playing.” The sentiment is apparently shared among artists—Willie Nelson (90), Bob Dylan (82), and Smokey Robinson (83), are still touring—as well as political leaders like President Joe Biden (80) and Mitch McConnell (81), and business giants like Warren Buffet, who recently turned 93.

Key performance indicators <#> A thief grabbing an olive under a giant bottle of olive oil Francis Scialabba
Stat: In a heist worthy of Danny Ocean, thieves in Spain operating under cover of darkness last week managed to make off with 50,000 liters of a precious commodity: olive oil <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAi?mblid=cc5b20ad0c0a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. In addition to being delicious, the stolen oil was worth 500,000 euros. Thefts of Rachel Ray’s favorite ingredient (and of olives themselves) have been on the rise since a major drought caused poor harvests, sending prices skyrocketing. The cost of a bottle of olive oil at Spanish supermarkets has jumped 15% since July, according to Bloomberg.

This year’s Burning Man looked a lot like the famously mucky Woodstock.

A monsoon on Friday began dumping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bte?mblid=23873dc47f7b&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> two to three months’ worth of rain on the counterculture fest in the middle of the Nevada desert, leaving 72,000 Burners stranded there over the weekend. Flash flooding and copious mud rendered the only road out of the venue unusable for most vehicles. Yesterday, organizers finally gave folks the greenlight to hit the road en masse.

In the latest sign that Burning Man has gone mainstream, POTUS was briefed on the sitch in the makeshift Black Rock City.

Organizers told attendees to shelter in place on Saturday and Sunday, urging them to conserve food, water, and fuel. Anyone with enough resources was encouraged to stay true to the communal spirit of the event by sharing with others.

Local authorities investigated a death that occurred during the rainstorm but said that it wasn’t related to the weather.

Departing while the roads were still washed out involved trudging through miles of mud to take a bus or hitch a ride to the nearest city, Reno, in a bigger vehicle. Among those impatient enough to make the trek <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btf?mblid=6017848b700c&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> were comedian Chris Rock and DJ Diplo of the music trio LSD.

Anyone willing to stick around was ultimately able to witness the postponed burning of “the man,” a giant effigy that’s traditionally set on fire on the penultimate night of the festival.

Big picture: The size and stature of the crowd trapped by the storm show how much Burning Man has changed from a low-key bohemian bonfire to a can't-miss event for tech moguls and celebrities. But the transformation is also causing some to question how committed the festival is to its progressive ideals, especially considering the environmental impact of a massive desert rager. Traffic into Burning Man went catawampus at the outset of the festival when climate activists blocked the same road that the climate itself disrupted days later.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> The headquarters of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk LISELOTTE SABROE/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images
Weight loss drugs are the new luxury. Not just because of their high prices, but because the company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, just became Europe’s most valuable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btj?mblid=6a2f6131b873&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, eclipsing luxury conglomerate LVMH. The Danish drugmaker had a value of $428 billion when European markets closed yesterday (compared to LVMH’s $419 billion), putting it on top of the heap. Its share price rose on the introduction of Wegovy into the UK market—where it costs much less than in the US. The company's success has had a big impact on the Danish economy: The nation recently boosted its forecast for economic growth for the year as a result.

Ukraine is getting a new defense minister. Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, who had been in charge of the nation’s armed forces since before Russia invaded, resigned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btk?mblid=f0ba7aee1426&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans to replace him over the weekend. Though Zelensky merely said “new approaches” were needed, the move comes after some called for Reznikov to step down following corruption scandals in the military even though he wasn’t directly implicated in them. His proposed replacement, Rustem Umerov, will have plenty to deal with: Russia’s President Vladimir Putin plans to meet with North Korea to secure more weapons. Putin also rejected calls to reinstate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btl?mblid=a4cd3cb7ab9f&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a global deal allowing Ukrainian grain exports.

It might be time to plan a Eurotrip.

British Airways, Aer Lingus, and reliably cheap EasyJet all announced sales yesterday, and Norway’s Norse Atlantic Airways had round-trip flights between the US and London available for around $300, according to Bloomberg. The airlines are not only concerned about the seasonal slump, but also that high prices and potential upcoming airline strikes could keep people from taking to the skies.

Good morning. Today, Morning Brew is going back to school with a special edition newsletter all about…school. Because it’s that time of year.

Don’t worry—we won’t call on you to see if you’re paying attention, but we did write stories about ChatGPT’s role in the classroom, the rise of a trend called “microschools,” the clever ways kids are hiding their vapes, and more.

A final housekeeping note: We’ll send a Brew Review tomorrow but will be OOI (out of inbox) on Monday for Labor Day.

Have a great weekend!

Investors digested more economic data that’s likely to make Jerome Powell smile: The economy added 187,000 jobs in August, and unemployment rose to 3.8% from 3.5%—signs that the labor market is cooling as the Fed wants, but not so fast that it’s likely to spark a recession.

Stock spotlight: Dell had its best day since the company went public for the second time in 2018 after far surpassing expectations for Q2. Analysts called it an early winner of the AI boom.

 

TECH

It’s time for ChatGPT to head to class <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsd?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> ChatGPT logo sits at a classroom desk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsd?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. That’s the common view among educators across the country as they head into the first full school year in which ChatGPT will be available to students.

Though many of the largest school districts in the country initially banned the bot after “As an AI, I…” started showing up in students’ essays, about three-quarters of K-12 educators now believe it’s at least “fairly important” to teach students how to properly use AI tools, according to an EdWeek Research Center survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bse?mblid=241814dcd28b&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Plus, teachers realized that banning ChatGPT at school disadvantages kids who don’t have a computer or smartphone at home, so New York City schools revoked their restrictions in May and Los Angeles schools are now working to loosen <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsf?mblid=7a68a6d0d157&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their anti-ChatGPT policy, per the New York Times.

Training wheels: On

Some educators want ChatGPT to be used like a calculator to cut down tedious work and let students (and teachers) reserve more brainpower for the higher-level thinking that only humans can do.

Possible classroom applications include…

Students using ChatGPT as a debate partner that points out weaknesses in their arguments, or as a brainstorm buddy for essay topics.

Teachers determining whether assignments are too easy by how well ChatGPT performs. They can take it a step further by having students critique the bot’s answer.

Personalized tutoring through programs like Khanmigo, Khan Academy’s beta-mode AI tool <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsg?mblid=c7cfb5828062&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Thousands of teachers and students are enlisting Khanmigo for help with math problems and lesson plans, or to chat with an artificial version of Albert Einstein and other notable figures.

Back-to-school jitters: Chatbot-enabled cheating and plagiarism remain a concern, especially since OpenAI announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsh?mblid=469ecfbadb35&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that AI-generated content detectors are largely unreliable. Educators will likely rely on live proctoring or monitoring software. And some already conduct in-person baseline assessments at the beginning of the year, so it stands out if a student who struggles with vocabulary suddenly whips out the word “antidisestablishmentarianism.”—ML

No, we aren’t reading from your elementary school report card. That’s what Onfolio’s preferred shareholder dividends have been like every quarter since January 2021.

You read that right. Onfolio has been paying their preferred shareholders 12% per year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/brH?lp=text1&mbadid=8f065c20c52302add2b70608e34f632f&mbadv=a&mblid=844b8d0d77d0&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for 2.5 years.

And here’s where you come in: They’ve announced they’re raising $10m in new preferred shares to investors.

Onfolio buys only profitable online businesses, which is the only way they can get away with paying out 12% dividends to shareholders like you.

The only bad news is, investors have already reserved $2m of those shares in the last week.

CULTURE

The biggest trend for schools is going small <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsl?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Derek Zoolander saying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsl?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Zoolander/Paramount Global via Giphy
Picture a school: It’s probably a large brick building that smells like chalk and is full of students. But a new kind of school <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsm?mblid=cf16e415142c&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with way fewer pupils is becoming increasingly popular.

They’re called microschools, and they serve between five and 25 kids who are following home-schooling curriculums and supervised by an adult who may not be a teacher. There are at least 125,000 microschools in the US with ~1.5 million students, the head of the National Microschooling Center, Don Soifer, told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsn?mblid=3bfb3a67eb3e&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> EducationWeek.

What’s behind these tiny schools getting bigger? Many parents turned to home schooling because of the pandemic, and now there’s money flowing into these smaller learning environments.

As states adopt voucher systems for private schools, roughly a dozen currently permit that cash to be used for home schooling, and therefore at microschools.

Nonprofits that support school choice and vouchers are also sending funds to home-schooling organizations, some of which support microschools.

And venture capitalists have plowed tens of millions of dollars into companies that serve this market, per the Washington Post. That includes businesses like Prenda and KaiPod that help parents to set up their own microschools.

Microschool advocates say that their size allows for more individualized, student-focused environments. But critics note that, although it varies by state, they’re usually required to follow many fewer standards and rules than public and private schools, leading to the possibility of poor quality education or even abuse.

Looking ahead…Soifer acknowledges microschools are still in the “early adoption stage.” And since policy decisions have sped their growth, different ones could slow it down.—AR

POLICY

MA students are getting their school lunch paid for by millionaires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsr?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> School lunch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsr?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Christina House/Getty Images
There is now such a thing as free lunch—at least for anyone who attends a public school in Massachusetts.

Students in the state will be offered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bss?mblid=204cece98cfb&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> complimentary food fight ammo breakfast and lunch permanently even as pandemic-era school meal programs have expired, with expenses covered by the newly implemented millionaires tax.

Bay Staters voted to impose a 4% levy on any income of state residents over the $1 million mark last November.

The tax is expected to help the state raise $1 billion for its 2024 budget, over half of which is earmarked for education (including free school meals).

Why is free lunch worth it?

Advocates say that on-the-schoolhouse meals help ensure that kids aren’t learning on an empty stomach, since charging students for lunch makes it more difficult for those from lower-income households to get sufficient calories.

Free lunch does appear to impact how many students eat at school. A federal pandemic-era free school meals program is thought to be the reason why schools served 80 million more meals in 2022 than in the year before the pandemic.

PUBLIC HEALTH

New vapes look an awful lot like school supplies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsx?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of a vape that looks like a pen <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsx?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Just in time for the new school year, e-cig manufacturers have realized that the only thing more appealing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsy?mblid=3a1409920b83&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to high school students than a creamsicle-flavored vape is a creamsicle-flavored vape that looks like a neon highlighter.

That’s because no one can tell it’s a vape when it looks like something that belongs in a pencil case. Available from the internet, the black market, or your friend’s older cousin Todd, many vapes being snuck into schools this year are ones that look like school supplies—not just highlighters, but also USB drives, ballpoint pens, and more.

Authorities are warning parents about these masters of disguise. Government officials around the country are worried that the undetectable nature of these e-cigs will threaten efforts to curb teen nicotine usage. While the FDA has tried to regulate the vaping industry, e-cig manufacturers keep getting around it.

The FDA banned flavors for cartridge-based e-cigs, like Juuls, in 2020…but that doesn’t apply to disposable vapes, which are used by more than half of the high school and middle school students who partake.

Since 2020, the number of different vape devices in the US has tripled to nearly 9,000, according to the Associated Press, caused by an influx of unauthorized vapes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsz?mblid=fbe3d2c274e8&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from China.

Big picture: As the industry continues to innovate faster than the FDA can regulate, some state governments are trying to stop vaping themselves. Yesterday, a new Texas law took effect that sends students caught with a vape to an alternative school disciplinary program.—CC

BOOKS

Our favorite back-to-school reads <#> Library shelves full of books Aerial Perspective Images/Getty Images
Not all books assigned in English class deserve the SparkNotes treatment. Some, in fact, are worth reading all the way through.

Below, the Brew writers share the books we read in our school days that we can’t stop thinking about.

Cassandra: Notre-Dame de Paris <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsD?mblid=fde6c5ac730e&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Victor Hugo. When my professor assigned this to my comparative literature class in college, I expected it to be lame. It was anything but. The book is more an ode to the city of Paris than the story of one hunchback, so don’t let the Disney movie dissuade you. All in all, it’s a story about beauty, belonging, and redemption, with an ending that gutted me in a way no other book ever has. Thanks, Dr. Stapleton.

Molly: Ishmael <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsE?mblid=7562e1fcbe79&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Daniel Quinn. This novel about a talking gorilla was one of my first introductions to critical self-reflection, both as an individual and for our species. Ishmael is a philosophical excavation of the relationship between humankind and nature, the cultural narratives that prop up our civilization, and the places humanity may be headed if we don’t adjust course. Shoutout to my favorite high school teacher, Noreen McGoldrick, for always pushing me to challenge what I thought I knew.

Sam: The White Tiger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsF?mblid=1030508f9ecd&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Aravind Adiga. Hats off to Ms. Westbrook from sophomore English for what was a surprising page-turner when assigned reading wasn’t always high on my to-do list. The Booker Prize-winning novel felt like a gripping excursion through contemporary India, with biting social commentary. Some of the dynamics reminded me of my native Russia—plus, it was hard not to fall under the charms of the antihero narrator whose social circumstances and personal ambition led him to commit a violent act similar to that of the protagonist in Crime and Punishment.

Abby: Their Eyes Were Watching God <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsG?mblid=0a47a9464e86&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston created a “strong female lead” way before it was cool. Add to that a juicy love story and witty, evocative writing in a unique style meant to evoke 1900s southern, Black dialect, and high school me was hooked on the Harlem Renaissance novel. Props to Mr. Williams for including it on the syllabus.

Neal: A Prayer for Owen Meany <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsH?mblid=2de775d6d099&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by John Irving. As a baseball-loving boy who grew up in a small New England town, my brain got wrecked (in a good way) by this novel about two Little Leaguers growing up in a small New England town. Of course, Owen Meany is about far more than baseball, diving deep into themes like faith, friendship, and fate. I’ll also never forget how Owen Meany’s dialogue is presented in all-caps—it makes you vividly hear what the narrator calls Owen’s “wrecked voice.”

Markets: Despite a recent rally, stocks couldn’t climb out of the deep hole they dug themselves earlier in the month, and all three major indexes finished August in the red. Cannabis companies were the clear winner <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bop?mblid=751771f3f8f4&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday following news that the Department of Health and Human Services recommended that pot should be reclassified as a lower-risk substance.

Economy: Fed Chair Jerome Powell might treat himself to a few bloodys at Saturday brunch. A report released yesterday showed that inflation is on the right trajectory back to the Fed’s 2% target. And this morning’s jobs report is expected to show a labor market that’s slowing down but remains on steady footing—exactly what the Fed wants to see.

Tech whizzes and copyright experts have teamed up to reduce the number of people haunted by the words “Ice cream machine’s broken.”

The online repair community iFixit and the DC-based nonprofit Public Knowledge are asking the government to let them fix McDonald’s soft serve dispensers, which is currently prohibited under copyright law. The treat machines are so notorious for breaking down that there’s a website for tracking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bor?mblid=d515035385c5&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> busted McFlurry-makers in the US (about 12% are currently offline). The fast-food joint has even joked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bos?mblid=2d2878bca618&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> about its frozen dairy dysfunction.

The ice cream machines have earned their reputation because they shut down and require tending to when they encounter a problem (just like us, fr). It’s a major drain for franchise owners but a boon for the machine’s manufacturer, Taylor Company, which has an exclusive repair contract with McDonald’s.

Every time an $18,000 McD’s ice cream-maker breaks down, franchisees need to call up a Taylor technician. If a non-Taylor handyperson is used, the ice cream machine’s warranty is revoked.

Fixing the complex machinery costs $350 for every 15 minutes of service, according to Ars Technica, so it’s no wonder Taylor has generated 25% of its revenue from maintenance and repair services in recent years, Inc. reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bot?mblid=032836c34f88&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

iFixit recently broke down a Taylor ice cream machine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bou?mblid=b79b4bd41f41&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and found “easily replaceable parts” gatekept by “cryptic error messages.” A different company actually built an attachable device for ice cream-makers called Kytch that would help franchisees understand and address these confusing codes…but they’ve been in a legal battle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bov?mblid=994c6d0ea993&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with McDonald’s and Taylor for more than two years.

So, what do the fixers want?

In addition to seeking a copyright law exemption—which has consistently been granted to give independent repairers the means to fix Xboxes and other tech—iFixit and Public Knowledge are asking Congress to pass the Freedom to Repair Act, a stalled 2022 bill that would protect all repair exemptions and the distribution of independently made repair devices, like Kytch.

Right-to-repair gains ground: Apple has long opposed letting customers and unaffiliated repair shops fix its tech, but it’s changed its iTune in recent years to allow customers to order self-service repair kits. And just last week, the company came out in support <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bow?mblid=7eee65432002&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of a California right-to-repair bill.—ML

Tour de headlines <#> Plane takes off from an airport Tayfun CoÅkun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images
Flying for Labor Day weekend? Expect to fight someone for overhead bin space. TSA projects that 14 million passengers will be passing through its airport checkpoints between Friday and Wednesday, an 11% increase <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boA?mblid=04d38f00c420&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> over last year. Many of those people will have to bring their passports—international bookings for Labor Day have jumped 44% over last year now that the world has been flung open for travel. For those journeying closer to home, the average gas price of $3.83/gallon is about the same as last year.

UBS makes banking history. The Swiss lender posted the highest quarterly profit ever for a bank in Q2—$29 billion—thanks to its controversial rescue of rival Credit Suisse in March. That acquisition is looking like “one of the biggest steals in financial history <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boB?mblid=c626b3f3b35b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” per the FT, considering the skimpy $3.6 billion price UBS paid for Credit Suisse. While UBS execs have a challenging road ahead integrating Credit Suisse’s businesses into its own, investors seem to think it can pull it off: UBS shares jumped to their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, making it the second-largest bank in Europe behind HSBC.

Clarence Thomas acknowledges GOP megadonor paid for travel. In a financial disclosure form released yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas reported he took three trips <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boC?mblid=e1fbdd8771e4&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year on a private plane owned by Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. Thomas’s relationship with Crow had come under scrutiny after reports showed he did not disclose previous trips with the GOP booster. But Thomas defended omitting those trips, claiming that he was adhering to the judicial guidelines at the time. As for last year’s travel on Crow’s private plane, Thomas said his security detail recommended he fly noncommercial following the leak of the decision that SCOTUS would overturn Roe v. Wade.

Big news for anyone who wants to tell their grandkids that they saw Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour but doesn’t want to shell out $1,000 to see her at a football stadium: This fall, you can catch the tour in movie theaters for less than $20.

Yesterday morning, Swift revealed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boE?mblid=070ba2fdeb70&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that a concert film of her smash Eras Tour will be released in movie theaters on Friday, October 13, and AMC opened up presale tickets soon after her announcement ($19.89 for adults ).

Knowing all too well that any ticketing goof could result in a Capitol Hill hearing, AMC said it upgraded its website and ticketing systems to process more than 5x the peak traffic it’s ever experienced. But to give itself some cover, the theater chain said it was “also aware that no ticketing system in history seems to have been able to accommodate the soaring demand from Taylor Swift fans when tickets are first placed on sale.”

To handle the Swiftie hordes, AMC said it will show the movie at all of its US locations at least four times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays during the initial run.

Exorswift was not meant to be. The Eras Tour movie was initially scheduled to hit theaters the same day <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boF?mblid=934b3d29e103&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as the latest Exorcist film, but Universal pushed the release date of its horror movie up one week following Swift’s announcement.

Tiny countries are getting rich off their domains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boJ?mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo of a beach in Anguilla <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boJ?mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Atlantide Phototravel/Getty Images
If you want to learn about passive income, talk to Anguilla.

The Caribbean nation half the size of Washington, DC, inadvertently struck gold <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boK?mblid=c56c1c03d488&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when it was designated the country-specific website domain name “.ai” in the ’90s.

It wasn’t a cash cow then, but with ChatGPT leading the acceleration of AI this year, the domain “.ai” has become popular among tech startups looking to give their companies some extra rizz. The person in charge of the Anguilla domain, Vince Cate, told Bloomberg <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boL?mblid=62099f51660b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, “Since November 30, things are very different here.” (ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022.)

How Anguilla makes money from this: Domain registrars like Hover pay Anguilla $140 for every two-year .ai domain registration. According to Cate:

Anguilla domains doubled in the past year, to nearly 300,000.

Domain revenue is estimated to reach $25 million–$30 million this year, compared to $8.3 million in 2022. If it hits $26.75 million, it will account for 25% of Anguilla’s total annual revenue, which is estimated at $107 million.

It’s not the only country finding money in the URL bar. The South Pacific island of Tuvalu—with, you guessed it, a “.tv” domain—earns an estimated $10 million a year from its contract with GoDaddy, thanks to the streaming boom.—CC

Stat: Someone should probably check on Corn Kid. For the first time in more than 50 years (save one outlier in 2013), the US is no longer the No. 1 global exporter of corn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boP?mblid=b537fd9bf45b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, ceding the top spot to Brazil, Bloomberg reported. In the agricultural year ending Aug. 31, Brazil will have shipped 32% of the world’s corn exports, compared to the US’ 23%. The country known for its amber waves of grain has been losing market share of food exports for years, having also lost the No. 1 spot for soybean and wheat exports in the last decade.

The cast of Ferrari was given a special exemption by the striking SAG-AFTRA union to promote the film in Venice (because it’s being distributed by an indie studio), and Driver used the opportunity to call out Netflix and Amazon for not agreeing to the actors’ and writers’ contract demands.

The storm was the strongest one to hit the sparsely populated area southeast of Tallahassee in 125 years, fueled rapidly by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. With record-breaking storm surge and maximum sustained winds close to 125 mph, the storm flooded many areas and downed power lines, knocking out electricity for more than 400,000 people across the two states.

The storm has been deemed responsible for two traffic deaths in Florida, and search-and-recovery teams have been sent to the area, though many people evacuated before the worst of the hurricane. It also felled a 100-year-old oak tree outside the governor’s mansion, despite sparing the state capital the worst of its wrath.

President Biden called the governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to assure them that the federal government would aid in their states’ recovery.

The damage may be extensive and expensive

Before the storm struck Florida, insurance broker BMS predicted that any major hurricane hitting the state and moving into the Southeast would constitute a multibillion-dollar insurance industry event.

Last year, Hurricane Ian, a deadly storm, caused nearly $100 billion worth of damage in the area. And with climate change making dangerous and expensive extreme weather events more common, property insurance companies have begun to rethink their relationship with Florida (as well as other high-risk states like California).

Farmers Insurance stopped issuing new home, auto, and umbrella policies in the state in July.

Bankers Insurance and AIG subsidiary Lexington Insurance have also retreated from offering new policies in Florida, while AAA said it would not renew some policies in risky areas.

Looking ahead…the lack of available insurance and the high cost of insuring property in the state may mean some homeowners go without coverage, which can make rebuilding from a storm financially devastating.—AR

Health officials urge reclassification of marijuana as a lower-risk drug. Leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services urged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blQ?mblid=7c4b4ed4f2f0&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Drug Enforcement Administration to ease restrictions on marijuana in a letter viewed by Bloomberg. Weed is currently considered a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, putting it in the same category as LSD and heroin, but the letter said it should be changed to a Schedule III substance like pain medications and testosterone. This would not legalize the drug, as many states have done, but it would bring down many of the barriers the cannabis industry is facing, such as being barred from banks, so stocks in the industry rose on the news.

Mitch McConnell freezes again. During a press conference yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, abruptly stopped speaking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blR?mblid=6be15db375b2&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and appeared unable to respond to reporters’ questions for about 30 seconds. It’s the second similar episode within a month for the 81-year-old politician. The incidents have raised questions about his health and ability to lead his party through his current term, which ends in 2027. But concerns about American leaders’ age and stamina are a bipartisan issue: A recent poll <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blS?mblid=0be0aac4f050&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Associated Press found that 77% of US adults think President Biden, age 80, is too old for a second term.

The Biden administration wants overtime for 3.6 million more workers. The Department of Labor proposed a rule <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blT?mblid=e2e510584781&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that would require employers to pay overtime pay to salaried employees who make less than $1,059 per week, or ~$55,000 per year if they work more than 40 hours in a week—a big jump from the current rule set by the by the Trump administration, which tops out at a $35,600 salary per year. Before finalizing the rule, the DOL will accept public comments on the proposal for 60 days. But even once a final rule is issued, it could face legal challenges. During President Obama’s term, a federal judge ruled the department did not have the authority to raise the cutoff to $47,500.

Drug stores will start selling Narcan over the counter next week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blm?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Narcan nasal spray box <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blm?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Irfan Khan/Getty Images
For the first time, people across the US will soon be able to purchase an overdose-reversal drug that’s as easy to administer as Flonase, without a prescription.

Next week, nationwide chains like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, and Rite Aid will begin selling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bln?mblid=08b0f4128ce2&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> two-dose boxes of Narcan, a naloxone nasal spray that saves people from opioid overdose, in-store and online.

Making naloxone widely accessible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blo?mblid=35ffac8f4046&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has long been a goal for public health experts because Fentanyl-laced drugs can kill people before paramedics arrive, but some now worry that over-the-counter Narcan’s $45 retail price could be too high for those who need it most.

That’s where insurance (kind of) comes in:

Medicaid and Medicare already cover prescription naloxone, and so far, Missouri, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Rhode Island, and Oregon Medicaid programs said they’ll cover OTC Narcan, too.

While private health plans often restrict OTC drug coverage, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said it’ll fully cover nonprescription Narcan.

But this won’t help the one-fifth of people with opioid use disorder who are uninsured. Some government and harm reduction programs give out Narcan for free—and those groups can now order two-dose boxes in bulk at a $4/unit discount, according to manufacturer Emergent BioSolutions.

Other options include…a prescription-only naloxone generic by Teva Pharmaceuticals, which is widely available for less than $10 out of pocket. And another OTC version, RiVive, will head to stores early next year and is expected to cost less than Narcan.—ML

Tired of yelling at Alexa when you mean to yell at Google? Big Tech has found a solution <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blt?mblid=1354b9810273&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

This week, audio company Harman announced its new line of JBL Authentics: first-of-their-kind smart speakers that will simultaneously employ both Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant.

How it works: The speakers, in addition to looking sick on your credenza <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blu?mblid=4c4c096031a4&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, are unlike other assistant-agnostic speakers. You don’t have to manually switch between Alexa and Google or pick one during setup. Asked Google to play a song? You can ask Alexa to pause it.

Historically, Amazon and Google have not been interested in functioning seamlessly together. But this new move toward interoperability comes as the Big Tech competitors face a flagging market for smart home devices and fierce competition for both assistants from rapidly advancing AI systems.

There’s a lot to overcome: Smart speaker shipments saw their sixth consecutive quarterly drop in the first quarter of this year, plunging by 30%, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon’s Alexa division was reportedly on track to lose $10 billion dollars last year and was targeted in the company’s layoffs. Google has similarly struggled to generate buzz or significant revenue from its Assistant.—CC

The Huskers packed 92,003 people into the school’s football stadium to watch its women’s team play volleyball, surpassing the world record of 91,648 fans set at a Champions League game in Barcelona in 2022. Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium only holds 85,000 spectators for football (which still regularly transforms it into the state’s third-largest city), but to break the record for this event, seating was available on the field.

The United States Tennis Association investigated the source of the stench and concluded that no one was lighting up in the stands.

Good morning. Today, in the small town of Buñol, Spain, trucks will haul more than 100 tons of tomatoes to serve as ammo for the world’s largest food fight. Known as La Tomatina, the festival is held the last Wednesday of August and draws a crowd of 20,000 tomato-flingers who clearly don’t mind being left on red.

No one knows how this tradition began, but the town is probably eager to keep it going. Because of the citric acid of the tomatoes strewn everywhere, the clean-up leaves Buñol more sparkling than it was before.

Biden takes on Big Pharma to lower drug prices <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bim?mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A boxing glove punching a pill capsule <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bim?mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The Biden administration took its biggest step yet to lower drug costs for Americans, dropping the highly anticipated list of 10 prescription drugs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bin?mblid=9934524df6cd&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that will first be subject to negotiations with Medicare. The medicines include blockbuster treatments like the blood thinner Eliquis from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and the diabetes pill Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Pharma companies are having kittens over this move—one of the most substantial actions ever taken against the industry—and are assembling an army of lawyers to stop it from happening.

How we got here

Medicare, the government’s health program covering 65 million Americans, has not been able to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. But that changed last year when Democrats included the measure in their Inflation Reduction Act, one of the few items in the massive bill that actually aims to…reduce inflation.

The theory is that by unleashing the bargaining power of the US’ largest buyer of healthcare, the government and consumers will save billions on drugs.

And surprise: People like paying less for drugs. Nearly 90% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans were in favor of the policy, according to a KFF survey last year. That overwhelming support is probably due to the fact that as of 2019, the US spent about double <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bio?mblid=eb735a8e3c38&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on prescription drugs compared with peer countries, per OECD data.

But pharma is fighting back

Large drugmakers, including J&J, Merck, and Bristol, have already sued the government over its Medicare negotiation push, calling it unconstitutional. Specifically, they say the Biden administration is violating the Fifth Amendment’s ban on seizing private property for public use without paying for it fairly. The pharma industry also claims that by hamstringing drugmaker revenues, the government will discourage the development of future life-saving treatments.

Looking ahead…the new drug prices won’t take effect until 2026, but we might see this argued before the Supreme Court before then.—NF

Forecasters are warning the powerful Idalia could bring potentially life-threatening storm surges to the state’s west coast from the panhandle down to Tampa, and Gov.

The slumbering crypto industry has been eagerly anticipating a spot bitcoin ETF <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biU?mblid=637eaf99333c&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (as opposed to existing crypto ETFs based on futures) because it could attract a torrent of cash and interest from individual investors.

After being dragged on social media for its hilariously bad AI-generated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biB?mblid=4eb21cb7d7a1&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> high school football reporting, the Columbus Dispatch and its owner Gannett announced they are pausing their local AI sportswriting initiative.

What happened: An article written by AI recapping a football game in Westerville, Ohio, went viral on X <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biC?mblid=f8187754d79b&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for being borderline illegible.

The write-up used the phrase “a close encounter of the athletic kind” to describe the game.

One sentence reads: “The Warriors chalked up this decision in spite of the Warhawks’ spirited fourth-quarter performance,” which makes perfect sense.

The Dispatch’s ethical guidelines state that AI content has to be verified by humans before being used in reporting, but it’s unclear whether that step was taken. Another AI-written sports story in the Dispatch initially failed to generate team names, publishing “[[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]]” and “[[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]].” The Dispatch has since updated AI-generated stories to correct errors.

Big picture: Major news outlets are still figuring out how to incorporate AI into their reporting process. Reuters, the AP, and others have published guidelines to define AI’s role in the newsroom, while Google is reportedly testing an AI product that helps journalists produce news stories. But expect more close encounters of the robot kind—experts estimate that 90% of content on the internet in a few years will be AI-generated, according to Axios.—CC

Stat: You know those prompts at checkout counters that ask you to donate to charity? They raise boatloads of money for nonprofits. Consumers spent $749 million on donations at checkout <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biW?mblid=56ea2fc0d5ca&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year, up 24% from 2020, according to social impact organization Engage for Good. Stop & Shop, for example, brings in $1 million–$2 million per month for its breast cancer and food-security initiatives, per the WSJ. But while the amount of giving has never been higher, Americans are getting fed up with retailers always asking for tips and donations: Only 59% of consumers said they donated to charity at the register this year, down from 80% in 2021, according to a survey from Accelerist.

With his stern warning, Jassy joins a growing group of CEOs ditching gentle reminders for blunt force to get employees back to the office.

Good morning. The excitement was palpable at West Point yesterday as cadets and staff at the US Military Academy prepared to open a recently discovered lead box that was believed to be a time capsule left by students in the 1820s. Would it contain a flag? A class ring? A note of encouragement to future West Point cadets?

Nope. When two school employees opened the time capsule in front of a packed auditorium, all they found was…mud.

PSA to everyone at West Point: The next time you attempt to pry open a lead box that’s been buried for centuries, please watch a single horror movie first. Y’all just released a demon.

Some of the richest people in the world are (land)banking on a new California utopia.

The New York Times <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bea?mblid=fed7f6ec65d6&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> reports that several of the techiest bros have banded together to buy up $800 million worth of land in Solano County, California—just a few hours outside of the San Francisco Bay Area—with the intent to build a new city.

With Silicon Valley-area real estate constantly getting snapped up faster than you can say “vest,” Big Tech moguls have grown frustrated with the lack of housing options impacting their ability to expand their workforces. The new city, pitched as a clean-energy, public-transit-accessible, high-density urban area, is meant to combat the problem.

That explains why the land’s mystery buyers turned out to be a who’s who of tech entrepreneurship. The NYT found:

The company making the purchases is Flannery Associates, the creation of former Goldman Sachs trader Jan Sramek.

Investors include Sequoia Capital Chairman Michael Moritz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z, Stripe co-founders Patrick Collison and John Collison, and Steve Jobs’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs.

Will it be a real city or a pie in the sky? To the list of billionaires above, this city represents the greatest opportunity since a man made a computer in his garage, not only relieving some of California’s massive housing shortage, but also creating thousands of new jobs, increased tax revenue, and infrastructure investment.

But…California is a notoriously difficult place to build new houses, and most of the property that Flannery bought is not zoned for residential use.

Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district where the purchases took place, told Bloomberg that Solano County’s residents would likely need to pass a rezoning initiative for the development to have a chance—and he said that’s unlikely. It probably won’t help that many residents were sued by Flannery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beb?mblid=ae5a9ac04c1e&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2018 for allegedly conspiring to raise land prices.—CC

BUSINESS

A Chinese card game is now a vital business skill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bef?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> People playing Guandan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bef?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> NurPhoto/Getty Images
Every country has its own social activity for business deals like golf in the US and sauna in Finland, but these days in China it’s all about “throwing eggs.”

That’s the translated name of the pokerlike card game Guandan that has grown into a phenomenon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beg?mblid=2716282f97ef&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> among Chinese business elites as the US and China become less economically entwined.

Foreign investment in China plunged to a 25-year low this spring, so Chinese dealmakers chasing yuan increasingly find themselves schmoozing with local bankers and regional government officials who dole out financial incentives to key industries—and mastering the four-person strategy game has become a reliable way to bond with them. Meanwhile, the importance of having a good Guandan face is only growing since President Biden moved to restrict US investment in Chinese AI, quantum computing, and semiconductor companies earlier this month.

But the Chinese government will probably be watching for foul play. In 2014, the country’s state media urged government officials to stop playing mahjong claiming it facilitated corrupt deals.

Zoom out: The slowdown in foreign investment comes as the Chinese economy is also dealing with slumping exports, sluggish consumer spending, record youth unemployment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WV?mblid=5dbfcd6c7250&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and deep trouble in its outsize real estate sector.—SK

TRAVEL

Google Flights upgraded its cheap airfare tracker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bek?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Plane takes off from phone showing new Google Flights features. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bek?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photo: Google
Buckle your fanny pack: Airport dads are about to be even more responsible now that Google Flights is rolling out new tools for cost-conscious travelers.

PSA: Google announced yesterday that the beginning of October is projected to be the best time to book a domestic Thanksgiving or mid-December flight this year. For US → Europe trips, prices are only expected to increase with time, especially once you’re 72 days out.

The days of widespread near-departure price dips may be over for now, but Google Flights promises it can still help you find cheap tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bel?mblid=590a4f48fd01&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> per trend data with…

Cheapest time to book: Before this upgrade, Google Flights already labeled current ticket prices as low, typical, or high compared to past averages, but now some listings feature a date range showing when flights will cost the least.

Price tracking: Opt-in notifications alert you to price drops for specific dates or for any time in the next three-to-six months.

Price guarantee: A colorful badge appearing next to some flights means you’ll be reimbursed via Google Pay if the ticket price drops after you hit “purchase.”

Zoom out: These updates take aim at other airline ticket services like Kayak and Hopper, which offer similar features but charge extra for their versions of price guarantees.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher waving The Screen Actors Guild Awards via Giphy
Stat: If your preferred way of telling your loved ones happy birthday is letting a celebrity do it for you, you’re in luck: Cameo, the site that lets you pay famous people to make videos, has seen a 137% surge in actor sign-ups <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bep?mblid=b99b8ad621a5&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> thanks to the Hollywood actors’ strike, according to CNN. Since actors walked off the job last month, more than 2,400 performers have joined or rejoined the site. And it’s not just unknowns—SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher reinstated her account this week, making herself available to spout whatever gobbledygook fans request in her distinctive nasal register for $1,500 a video.

Quote: “It’s a lot of fun collecting different Pokémon, but the game does get a little repetitive after a while.”

Pokémon Sleep, which was released last month, recently surpassed the 10 million downloads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beq?mblid=98225fa57791&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> milestone—but it remains to be seen whether it can harness the same gotta catch ’em all energy as its wildly popular big sibling, Pokémon Go, since you play the newer game by…dozing off. Bloomberg reports that Google searches for the sleep-based game have already dropped by half. Still, Pokémon Sleep got enough attention in its early days that one Japanese gaming site caught flak for suggesting players up their game by taking sleeping pills. Also, the game reportedly records sleepers’ farts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ber?mblid=22a1f2e03534&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (no judgment on whether that makes it more or less fun).

But now, the state is finally telling its neglected middle child: “You exist.” Last week, NJ Gov. Phil Murphy literally put Central Jersey on the map by ordering the state’s tourism department to redraw its map to include the region and promote it in all marketing campaigns.

Glad you’re finally getting the recognition you deserve, Central Jersey. Round of Sanchezes on me at Hoagie Haven.

Markets: Investors weren’t fazed by Jerome Powell’s warning in Jackson Hole that he could raise interest rates even more, sending the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to their first weekly gain in three weeks.

Experiencing the world without chemically altering your brain is going out of style.

The use of cannabis and psychedelic drugs among US adults hit all-time highs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baN?mblid=5be21fdb2c13&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year, according to the annual Monitoring the Future study from the University of Michigan. The milestone—which was decades in the making—could be fueled by a number of factors: loosened laws around these substances, changing public perception of hallucinogens, and more Americans self-medicating for mental health issues.

Here are the cannabis stats you should write down before you forget them.

44% of young adults 19–30 and 28% of adults 35–50 reported using marijuana in the prior 12 months, a record high for each age group.

And more than 11% of young adults said they used cannabis on at least 20 of the prior 30 days, double the share from a decade ago.

Psychedelics use is also up dramatically. About 8% of young adults said they used mind-altering drugs like MDMA and psilocybin (shrooms) in the prior 12 months, more than double the rate from 2012.

Silicon Valley’s drugs of choice

Nowhere is the rise of psychedelics more pronounced than in Silicon Valley, where microdosing has become a cornerstone of corporate culture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baO?mblid=9dfd0b9904ad&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to the WSJ. Tech elites have swapped out Don Draper’s old fashioned for ketamine, LSD, and magic mushrooms to alleviate anxiety or help them think of a revolutionary business idea.

Elon Musk has taken ketamine, Google co-founder Sergey Brinn sometimes does shrooms, and the major VC firm Founders Fund has thrown psychedelics-infused parties, per the WSJ.

But getting high on the job isn’t limited to the tech industry: The number of American workers testing positive for marijuana hit a 25-year record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baP?mblid=6c6aa34bea9f&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year, according to an annual survey from Quest Diagnostics.

Big picture: More than two-thirds of states allow medical or recreational use of cannabis, and a flurry of medical studies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baQ?mblid=2dabef88b772&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into psychedelics has shown that, in controlled settings, they can be beneficial for mental illnesses. There’s growing recognition in the scientific community that these drugs have untapped potential to help people, but experts also warn they carry substantial risks that need to be studied more.

Unwanted soccer kiss sparks Spain’s #MeToo moment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baU?mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Players of Atletico de Madrid and AC MIlan pose with a message in support of Jennifer Hermoso <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baU?mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Angel Martinez—AC Milan/AC Milan via Getty Images
#SeAcabó, Spanish for “It’s over,” is trending across Spanish social media as a nonconsensual kiss following the women’s team World Cup win has spiraled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baV?mblid=a197291ef18c&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into a broader conversation about women’s equality in the country.

The latest: FIFA suspended Spanish soccer federation president Luis Rubiales for 90 days after he grabbed forward Jenni Hermoso’s head and kissed her on the lips during the event’s victory ceremony. Rubiales claims Hermoso gave him consent but Hermoso denied that conversation took place and said she was “the victim of an aggression.”

A defiant Rubiales refused to resign, prompting the World Cup champions to declare they would not play again until he was removed from his position.

Meanwhile, politicians across political lines and the team’s corporate sponsors <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baW?mblid=d2b5940b486c&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> voiced support for Hermoso and condemned Rubiales’s actions.

Big picture: Through the #SeAcabó hashtag, women in Spain are using the controversy to spotlight their mistreatment by men that’s never made public. Spain’s acting equality minister called the kiss a “form of sexual violence that we women suffer on a daily basis and until now has been invisible.” And Spanish player Misa Rodríguez shared a cartoon that depicts a girl asking her grandmother, “Grandma, tell me about how your team won the World Cup.” The grandmother replies, “We didn’t just win the World Cup, little one. We won so much more.”

The problem is that higher production costs and shrinking demand for vin have made it impossible for French wineries to sell their spiked grape juice for a profit, even if it does have tantalizing hints of oak and leather. The average French citizen drinks about 40 liters of wine per year, compared to 136 liters in 1926.

🫘 Coffee beans make concrete stronger. Researchers looking to minimize food waste found inspiration—and then construction materials—in their morning brew. A team of Australian scientists has produced concrete that is about 30% stronger by replacing 15% of the mixture’s sand with charred coffee grounds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9b?mblid=d48888d0edf4&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Australia produces enough concrete that researchers say all 75,000 metric tons of the country’s annual coffee waste could be repurposed as a partial sand substitute, which would help the environment and reduce the construction industry’s demand for natural resources. The researchers are already working with local governments on future infrastructure projects.

A natural solution for nearsightedness. With half of the world anticipated to be unable to see across a room without glasses or surgery by 2050, eye doctors in Taiwan have found a simple solution to prevent childhood myopia, or nearsightedness: spending more time in the great outdoors. Poor eye health has been a big problem for the island country, where around 90% of high schoolers have already developed blurry vision <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9c?mblid=3062cea73f61&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>—compared to just 50% of all age groups in Europe and the US. But in the few years since Taiwan launched a program to get young school children outside for two hours each day, myopia rates among primary school kids steadily declined from a peak of 50% to 46.1%.

Participation could be in your DNA. If you’ve ever agreed to be a test subject in a genetics study, you may have inherited a predisposition to participate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9d?mblid=ed34430848f3&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from your parents. An Oxford study of genetic data from 30,000 relatives stored in the UK Biobank has found a genetic trait that makes people more likely to accept an invitation to join a research study. It’s correlated but distinct from educational attainment, BMI, and other traits. One researcher said this is a “huge step” toward eliminating ascertainment bias (similar to sampling bias) from genetic research, which would make study outcomes more accurate and representative of target populations.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Why is a ship snooping on an offshore wind farm? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The ship UHL Felicity with the first shipment of wind turbine parts for the state's offshore wind farm by Vineyard Wind travels through the New Bedford hurricane barrier <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Must-haves for a ship setting sail from Miami to New York: Ocean trip playlist, life jackets, and an American flag on its mast. But Old Glory is the most vital checklist item, since the voyage would be illegal without it. US law forbids foreign vessels from transporting goods between American ports.

The 1920 Jones Act requires that cargo ships undertaking domestic trips be made and registered in America and owned and crewed by Americans. And while an obscure maritime restriction protecting American shipping jobs might not sound like it has much to do with your daily life, its detractors say it pushes up prices and ruins your commute <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=00c80f30ade7&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Recently, it was accused of complicating the transition to clean energy by inhibiting the ship-heavy construction of offshore wind farms. The controversy shines a spotlight on the law’s unintended consequences.

The offshore problem

The Vineyard Wind project, currently under construction in the waters off Massachusetts, is the first major commercial offshore wind farm in the US. And the most wonkishly named ship in history, the Jones Act Enforcer, was recently spotted in the area <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9g?mblid=7c8103d77984&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Operated by an industry trade group, the ship’s crew watches over the construction to make sure that non-US ships employ American workers and otherwise comply with the Jones Act.

But not everyone appreciates it: Critics note that Vineyard Wind relies on specialized foreign vessels, and limitations on their use may be inflating costs.

The problem is that the US doesn’t have enough ships to build the wind farm, Joseph Webster of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center told the Boston Globe. He advocates for exempting the offshore wind industry from the rule or making exemptions for boats from US-ally nations (the US has suspended the Jones Act before, after national disasters).

With government funding pouring into clean energy projects, the debate is only likely to heat up.

How did this “Ship American” rule become a thing?

Laws promoting “Made In America” ships for domestic trade are almost as old as the nation, instituted beginning with the First Congress of the United States.

The restrictions were paused during World War I but reinstated shortly after with the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (aka Jones Act). Lawmakers worried that the US was too reliant on foreign ships to move goods around during the war and wanted to ensure it wouldn’t happen again.

To this day, the law’s supporters, including President Biden, tout its ability to protect American jobs in transportation and shipbuilding.

Throwing a wrench into all things water (and beyond)

American shipbuilding has taken a nosedive over the past century—ships are being made more cheaply in Asia—so the Jones Act has become a thorn in the side of many industries as fewer American-made ships are available for service.

The shortage of cheap domestic shipping options might explain why…

* Sending goods by sea from the US East Coast to Puerto Rico was twice as costly as shipments to neighboring Dominican Republic, per a 2012 New York Federal Reserve report.

* New England gets as much as 35% of its liquefied natural gas from abroad, despite the US being among the world’s largest exporters of LNG.

High costs for water transportation mean companies often turn to trucks instead of ships. A hypothetical Georgian farmer packing peaches on a Maine-bound truck rather than a barge might be the reason why you’re often “stuck on I-95 surrounded by smog-producing 18-wheelers,” notes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=7fd2875721f5&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> policy analyst Scott Lincicome <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9i?mblid=126b76893b3e&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the libertarian Cato Institute.

Looking ahead…don’t expect big changes. A bill to repeal the Jones Act was introduced in 2021, but Congress never voted on it since most politicians continue to support the law.—SK

If so, you might want to book a last-minute flight to the Scottish Highlands, where organizers are holding what could be the largest surface watch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9m?mblid=142e3380595b&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the Loch Ness Monster in more than 50 years.

Like Bigfoot or a better condiment than mayo, we still haven’t confirmed the existence of Nessie, the elusive sea creature whose legend dates back to the year 565, when an Irish saint was “said to have driven a beast back into the water.”

Nearly two dozen sightings of the monster were reported from the 1500s to the 1800s. But the search for Nessie found a global audience in the 1930s, when a local hotel manager reported seeing a “whale-like fish” in Loch Ness and a subsequent photograph showing a head and neck sticking out of the water captured the attention of people around the world (that photo turned out to be a hoax).

If Nessie does live—which would frankly be a stretch, since she’d be at least 1,400 years old—then this weekend’s quest will be the most high-tech effort yet to find her. Researchers plan to use drones equipped with thermal cameras to take infrared images of the water and will deploy a hydrophone that can pick up underwater sounds.

Modern science has been used before to detect whether a massive sea creature lurks in the waters of this vast lake, and the results weren’t kind to believers. In 2019, New Zealand researchers tested DNA in water samples from Loch Ness, but they only found genetic material from eels.

Still, against all common sense and available data, the search for Nessie carries on. You just know that one day she’ll emerge to the surface, give us a wink, and return to the impenetrable depths she’s called home for centuries.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: If you were a ghost, what would be your method of haunting people?

Here are our favorite responses:

* “I would constantly refill things for them (coffee machines, ice trays, candy jars, etc.). Chaotic good ghost is where it’s at.”—Zoe from FL

* “I’d switch the labels on spices. Cinnamon and chili powder can look very similar.”—Billy from Atlanta, GA

* “I would watch an episode of the current series they are on while they’re gone so they possibly miss an important part.”—Nolan from La Crosse, WI

* “I’d make that sound your smoke detector makes when it needs batteries but you can’t figure out which smoke detector is beeping.”—LB from CT

* “Reading over people’s shoulders and turning the page if I got done before them. Or turning the page back and not allowing it to be turned till I was done.”—Lisa from Kearney, MO

* “I’d live in the library and help people find their next great read by nudging it off the shelves toward them. Might also whack a few people on the head with books when they’re being stupid.”—Elizabeth from WY

This week’s question

What is your fantasy football league’s creative punishment for finishing in last place?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I’ve never been in a fantasy football league, but if I were, I’d suggest the punishment of making the loser spend two hours in front of a crowded farmers market asking for signatures on a fake petition to ‘legalize cheating on your partner.’”

American auto workers might ditch the assembly lines for picket lines next month. The nearly 150,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) employed at the Big 3 in Michigan voted overwhelmingly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bab?mblid=6746f168d060&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this week to authorize a strike if Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t reach a deal with the union before the current contract expires on September 14.

A work stoppage at the largest carmakers in the country could be the economic equivalent of a head-on collision.

A 10-day strike at all three would cost a whopping $5 billion, the Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimates.

And good luck shopping for a new ride: A prolonged strike could empty out dealer lots. Car inventories are already near an all-time low while car prices sit near record highs.

What might be on the picket signs?

The UAW asserts that workers deserve to share in the automaking trio’s successes. GM and Stellantis raked in record profits in recent years, and Ford has also seen strong earnings.

The union is demanding….

A 40% wage increase over the term of the next four-year contract, and a 32-hour workweek (instead of the current 40 hours) without pay cuts.

The return of benefits like company-provided pension plans and cost-of-living pay bumps that workers lost shortly before the government stepped in to bail out the auto industry during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

The UAW is also trying to protect workers as the industry shifts to EV production, which tends to require less labor, often for lower pay.

Looking ahead…the union could launch a work stoppage at just one or two of the automakers or at all three (which would be a historic first) if a deal isn’t reached. Analysts think a Stellantis strike is the most likely, given that UAW’s firebrand president, Shawn Fain, dramatically tossed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bac?mblid=10534d7557c0&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its contract proposal in the trash on a Facebook Live.—SK

The man who fell from the public’s good graces for keeping Taylor Swift’s original album masters under his thumb has been under a microscope <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bah?mblid=c4350ea495d4&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this week for appearing to have lost many of the high-profile artists on his all-star management roster.

The confirmed departures from Scooter Braun’s management company, SB Projects, are Demi Lovato, Carly Rae Jepsen, BabyJake, Asher Roth, Idina Menzel, and J Balvin. And according to unnamed sources in several publications…

Justin Bieber is trying to break his contract with Braun, who discovered the swoop-banged singer in 2008, though it’s supposed to last through 2027, per Billboard.

Ariana Grande, who has worked with SB Projects since 2013, is also rumored to have dumped Braun.

A source close to SB Projects denied the Bieber and Grande rumors, and Braun even joked about all the apparent defections, tweeting, “Breaking news...I’m no longer managing myself.”

There may be no bad blood: After selling his holding company in a billion-dollar merger with HYBE, the entertainment company behind K-Pop sensation BTS, Braun became the CEO of its US arm in January. A source close to SB Projects told Rolling Stone that Braun is transitioning from his manager era to his chief executive era.—ML

The college football season starts today, but we already know it will be the last of its kind. With all the money grabbing conference realignment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVY?mblid=36713f80eaf0&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that happened this summer, this is the last season for many long-standing rivalries, tailgates, and conference names that at least sort of make sense.

Week 0 kicks off today in Dublin, Ireland, as Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish (fitting) face the Navy Midshipmen, but everyone’s mind is already on next year.

Next season, the Big 10 (which currently has 14 teams) will expand <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mblid=6b7552a41e7b&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to 18, and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Big 12 will each increase from 14 schools to 16. That means:

This year’s iconic Oklahoma-Oklahoma State and Washington-Washington State matchups will likely be the last.

Next year, athletes playing for Oregon and Rutgers will make the longest in-conference trip in history at 2,463 miles.

With so many changes on the horizon, former Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby told the Associated Press, “It does seem like it will feel like a lame-duck year at some point in time."

More endings: Since 2014, the college football championship has been decided by a four-team knockout tournament. In the 2024 season, the seemingly quixotic idea of an expanded College Football Playoff will encompass 12 teams.—CC

Stat: Dallas now has something to brag about besides the brisket at Pecan Lodge. People ranked it the safest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bap?mblid=901f01ae0c70&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> out of 16 major US cities in a recent Gallup poll. Some 74% of survey respondents consider it safe to live in or visit, giving it a slight edge over No. 2 Boston (72%) and a big one over No. 16 Detroit (26%). But perhaps more striking than which cities most Americans think are safe is which Americans think it. Political leanings played a big role: Republicans were less likely to rate cities as safe than Democrats by an average of 29 percentage points. And the impact has increased over time—in 2006, the last time Gallup conducted a poll with the same list of cities, that gap was only 2 percentage points.

Good morning. ...Anyone? Hello? Bueller?

Oh, that’s right. Today is August 24, the most popular day of the year for employees to call out sick, according to a survey by Flamingo, a company that manages PTO. More American workers call out sick today than on Feb. 13, America’s second sickest day of the year and one that suspiciously lines up with the day after the Super Bowl.

If this is because there was a big party last night can someone just let us know next time.

US officials have not yet been able to verify this, and one person close to the Kremlin said Prigozhin sometimes takes a secondary plane out of caution.

Was Putin behind this?

Unconfirmed reports posted on the Telegram app indicate that the downed plane was shot out of the sky by Russian forces. If true, it would align with widespread theories that Putin was not done punishing Prigozhin for trying to overtake Moscow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DH?mblid=eb96a83da84d&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in June with his guns-for-hire army, the Wagner Group—which has played a major role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—before he took an exile deal that quickly ended the attempted mutiny.

Christo Grozev, a journalist who investigates alleged Russian plots—and correctly predicted Prigozhin’s attempted coup—told the Financial Times a couple weeks ago, “In six months Prigozhin will either be dead <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3s?mblid=a5a613f3efda&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> or there will be a second coup.” Grozev’s team helped uncover the attempted assassination via nerve agent of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Last month, President Biden appeared to nod at the possibility of a similar outcome for Prigozhin, saying, “If I were he, I’d be careful what I ate.”

India spent less money to land a spacecraft on the moon than Warner Bros. spent to make Gravity.

With a budget of just $75 million, India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft successfully landed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3y?mblid=5cb20689b7d5&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on the moon’s south pole yesterday, making India the first country to reach the unexplored terrain after a Russian spacecraft crashed in the same pursuit earlier this week. Its rover will rove in hopes of locating a water supply that is easily accessible—a necessity for more advanced and long-term missions to space.

The landing, in addition to being an immense source of national pride, signifies India’s prowess in launching high-quality moon missions with a Kirkland-level price tag.

The Indian Space Research Organization, which launched Chandrayaan-3, had a budget last fiscal year of less than $1.5 billion. By comparison, NASA currently has over $34 billion in budgetary resources.

India’s $6 billion private space industry, filled with space tech startups inspired by the likes of SpaceX, is expected to triple over the next two years.

People in the Midwest are welcoming the pumpkin spice latte back by slurping it in 100+ degree weather because fall starts when Starbucks decides. The PSL—now in its 20th year of being as synonymous with autumn as billowy scarves and going brunette—and the rest of the Starbucks seasonal fall menu went live today.

The iconic PSL will be joined by new menu items including the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte and the Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso. The fall newbies highlight two industry trends:

Everyone wants an iced coffee. Both new drinks by default are served over ice <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b36?mblid=5f786be36251&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, meaning three out of five of the Starbucks’s fall drinks are intended to be cold instead of hot. Five years ago, cold drinks accounted for about 50% of all the company’s beverage sales—now they’ve jumped to 75%.

R&D is watching TikTok. The Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte took inspiration from a popular customization by TikTokers who ordered from the coffee chain’s secret menu. And Starbucks isn’t the only chain getting its best ideas from 90-second videos: Chipotle added a new menu item to accommodate two quesadilla “hacks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b37?mblid=d395ddd47f13&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” that went viral on TikTok.

The study also found that local pharmacies like CVS and dollar stores widen social isolation among high- and low-income people.

Good morning. Morning Brew is offering a new course that will have managers running their teams as smoothly as a Nic Cage-led expedition to steal a historical document.

You think Benjamin Franklin Gates just guesses when he assigns someone a task? That he tells the computer guy who looks like Ed Snowden to knock some skulls? Or fails to utilize Dr. Abigail Chase’s archival expertise? Of course not. Gates knows that everyone on his team brings a different skill set to the table and puts them in the right seats for success.

To get your team to that level of execution, check out Building High-Performance Teams <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0V?mblid=4170a827417d&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. It’s a one-week virtual course to help managers build trust among their reports, hire the right people to fill gaps, and provide useful feedback. It begins on Aug. 28, so don’t miss out.

Shares of US banks fell after several regional lenders were hit with a credit downgrade. And retailers, which you’ll read about in a bit, have a glut of products that aren’t selling. In a sign of those consumer worries, Nike shares notched their longest losing streak ever, falling for the ninth straight day.

Japan to send treated radioactive water into the ocean <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0X?mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo of the Fukushima power plant <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0X?mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Air Rabbit/Getty Images
Tomorrow, Japan will begin a decadeslong process <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Y?mblid=9c6e88a74921&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.

Japanese officials say it’s a necessary step to decommission the plant, which was wrecked in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami there and suffered a nuclear disaster. For the past 12 years, hundreds of underground tanks have stored roughly 1.34 million metric tons of contaminated water from the nuclear plant and releasing the water into the ocean is considered the most feasible option.

It’s become a major controversy in the region. In July, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cleared the Japanese government’s plan to dump the water in the ocean. But neighboring countries, environmental activists, and the seafood industry are urging Japan to find an alternative.

In Japan, which exported $2 billion worth of fish in 2022, seafood workers are worried that this move will cause reputational harm and cost them their livelihoods.

South Korea and China, the biggest importers of Japanese seafood, have already banned fish imports from Fukushima.

Baby, there’s tritium in the water

Japan says it’s filtered out all the radioactive elements in the water…except one: tritium. This element that can’t be filtered (only diluted) has become the main point of tension around the plan.

Opponents warn of the potential harm of releasing tritium, which emits radiation, but supporters say that disposing of nuclear wastewater with minimal amounts of tritium has been done before in Japan and other countries.

The released water <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Z?mblid=b7ff525d6ae5&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> will contain 190 becquerels of tritium per liter, far below the World Health Organization’s safety limit of 10,000 becquerels per liter for drinking water, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company.

Two plants in the UK release between 400 and 2,000 terabecquerels of tritium into the ocean every year. Plants in Japan also discharged terabecquerels of tritium before the Fukushima accident.

But critics, including the US National Association of Marine Laboratories, argue that there are still unanswered questions and a lack of evidence about the safety of the water.

Looking ahead…after the discharge begins, Japan plans to test seawater and fish near the plant starting as early as next month. But disposing of all the water is expected to take between 30 and 40 years.—CC

Dick’s had its worst day ever.

Only pickleball players can save you now, Dick’s. Meanwhile, Macy’s also posted a sad excuse for a quarter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b12?mblid=588bab35f0d8&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, reporting shrinking sales across the board and particularly dramatic declines in categories like activewear and casual apparel. Macy’s CEO said consumers are spending less on goods and more on experiences this summer (see: Barbie’s $1+ billion at the box office).

Biden’s student loan repayment plan went live. The Biden administration is now allowing sign-ups <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b13?mblid=dbb2ec471468&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for its Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan for student loans, which it says can slash some borrowers’ monthly payments by 50% and eliminate all obligations for others. The typical borrower could save $1,000 per year under the new plan, the White House and the Dept. of Education said, though some benefits won’t kick in until next summer. Biden is trying to find ways to provide relief to student borrowers after the Supreme Court blocked his debt wipeout initiative in June.

Ikea is banking on it. Today, the furniture seller is opening <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b16?mblid=959d7b55c39b&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a smaller-scale format of its iconic store in a downtown SF mall even after dozens of other retailers have said to the struggling area.

Like the company’s relationship-ending nightstand assembly directions, its 2020 announcement that it would occupy a three-floor store in an abandoned mall was hard to comprehend. At least 150,000 office workers abandoned San Francisco during the pandemic, and nearly 40 stores have shut down in the city’s Union Square area over the last three years, according to Coresight.

Still, the new store’s manager told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b17?mblid=fcb42b244180&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the WSJ, “We do feel it’s a viable place.”

Trust the process: The new SF store is one of at least 17 stores Ikea plans to open in the US by 2026 in a $2.2 billion expansion push. Some of those locations will be mini Ikeas in downtowns that focus on selling Tvärfot table lamps to impecunious unpaid interns who don’t have much apartment space to fill.

These compact stores are performing well in cities like London, Mumbai, and Paris, Ikea said.

But in December 2022, the company shuttered its Queens, NY, location—its first attempt at a store in a dense, urban environment in the US.

Ikea’s arrival is a relief for a city that some critics say could enter a “doom loop.” But signs of life are popping up: The excitement around AI is starting to bring workers back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b18?mblid=0c5ab36e29e2&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into SF’s desolate offices.—MM

Sailing the high seas may give off Master and Commander vibes, but it’s coming back in 2023 as an innovative way to lower commercial shipping’s carbon footprint.

A cargo ship retrofitted with solid wing sails embarked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1d?mblid=6d92b6d11b1b&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on a trial voyage earlier this week, chartered by food giant Cargill for a fuel-efficient journey from China to Brazil. A UK company started by yacht racing pros, BAR Technologies, designed the so-called WindWings tech.

How it works:

Two foldable sails <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1e?mblid=b2fddbd66b7f&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> made from wind-turbinelike material were installed atop the bulk cargo vessel Pyxis Ocean and stand 123 feet above deck when raised.

Those sails enable a ship to harness sea wind for propulsion, reducing fossil fuel use by up to 20%.

The concept could be a game changer for the shipping industry, which relies primarily on oil-powered vessels and spits out around 3% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1f?mblid=8fe6b9e0726a&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of global carbon emissions. That existing ships can be modified to breeze along with the winds is particularly promising for making old gas guzzlers cleaner.

But this tech faces some headwinds. It’s unclear whether WindWings will be commercially viable before we all hit the age when a cruise becomes the go-to vacation: Cargill expects <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1g?mblid=9771f06ad882&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> it’ll take at least seven to 10 years for fuel savings to surpass the cost of installing the sails on the Pyxis Ocean.—SK

Key performance indicators <#> A house with lots of bedrooms Francis Scialabba
Stat: American homes are increasingly looking like your college dorm. Of the more than 1 million new single-family houses built in the US last year, 48% contained at least four bedrooms <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1k?mblid=2c7db4edbb9f&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, the highest share since the US Census started keeping track in 1973. The bedroom explosion comes at a time when American houses are getting considerably smaller <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1l?mblid=ccf821aa97e4&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and builders are cutting out dining areas, living rooms, and bathtubs from their blueprints, per the WSJ. Only 33% of existing US homes have four or more bedrooms, but the work-from-home era jacked up demand for a home office (which is presumably what all those extra bedrooms are for…).

SBF’s lawyers said his requests for his prescription medication (Adderall and an antidepressant) were denied, and, if that continues, SBF will be “severely negatively impacted in his ability to assist in his own defense.” SBF’s fraud trial over the collapse of the crypto exchange he founded, FTX, is set to begin in October.

A peek behind the scenes: The most popular words submitted were cattywampus, defenestrate, indubitably, kerfuffle, persnickety, bamboozled, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, nincompoop, flibbertigibbet, and copacetic.

But none of those is today’s word. See if you can figure out what is.

Cox reports:

A middle-of-the-road new car cost over $48,000 in July, up 30% since 2019.

And used cars were no better. The average July price was $27,000, also a 30% hike from 2019.

The pricey four-wheeled boxes a majority of Americans rely on to get places have been straining family budgets. It takes over 42 weeks of median household income to cover the average cost of a new car, per July data supplied by Cox and Moody’s Analytics.

On top of high prices, high-interest auto loans also burden auto owners, of which 17.1% had a monthly payment above $1,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYz?mblid=f3ec658758fc&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last quarter—a new record—according to Edmunds. This helps explain why auto loan delinquencies have been rising this year, despite the economy going strong with exceptionally low unemployment.

America’s obsession with jumbo rides is partially to blame for the high prices, since carmakers have ditched affordable compact vehicles. Pandemic-related supply chain snags also threw a wrench into production, creating a car shortage that made auto producers slap exorbitant price tags onto windshields.

But…despite the lack of cheaper models on the market, new car prices have finally begun to decrease slightly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYA?mblid=16575326ecd7&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as dealers report having more cars sitting on their lots.

Arm gears up for the year’s biggest IPO. The UK-headquartered chip maker filed paperwork <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYE?mblid=2c1f19e2556a&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday in anticipation of making its US market debut in September. There’ll be high stakes for Softbank, which bought the company for $32 billion 2016, as it tries to recover from recent losses by pivoting to an AI-based strategy with companies like Arm at the center.  Bloomberg reports that Arm had been looking to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion but now may seek less as Softbank plans to hold on to more of the company. The IPO is still expected to be the year’s biggest and to help other tech companies, including Instacart, decide whether to move forward with their own IPOs.

That would represent more than 11.6% of the global economy and a 50% jump from 2019. The industry group further predicts that some 430 million people will work in the industry—that’s 1 of every 9 jobs around the world.

RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for babies in the US. Once the CDC weighs in, Pfizer hopes to have the jab on the market by November.

If you thought the days of going to the mall to nibble on an Auntie Anne’s pretzel and wreak havoc in Bath and Body Works were over, think again.

According to a recent report from analytics firm Coresight Research, malls are back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYI?mblid=b89ac84bc5c2&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>:

From 2021 to 2022, mall sales increased 11% to over $800 billion dollars.

Foot traffic at top-tier malls, where the average shopper makes $200,000+ per year, increased 12% in 2022 compared to 2019.

What’s fueling the malls’ post-pandemic resurgence? While it once looked like the rise of e-commerce would kill the mall, brands have figured out that customers want both. They have invested in “omnichannel” marketing, which promotes online shopping and physical stores to drive growth, per Coresight. Plus, Gen Zers might have missed the halcyon mall days of Aéropostale and Hollister, but they are mall-loyal—a survey conducted by the International Council of Shopping Centers found that nearly as many Gen Z respondents shopped brick-and-mortar stores (97%) as they did online (95%).

Big picture: Retail is a bright spot in the otherwise dim outlook for commercial real estate. In Q2, office vacancy rates soared to a 30-year high of 18.2%, while the vacancy rate for retail space fell to 4.8%—the lowest level since real estate firm CBRE started tracking it 18 years ago. And 1,000 more stores are expected to open than to close this year.—CC

A $44 pickle sweatshirt making the rounds on TikTok is the new “I mustache you a question” merch for the terminally online generation.

Good morning. We’re lifting the wraps on a new project to make reading the Brew even more fun. Give a warm welcome to Word of the Day.

Here’s how it works: You, the readers, will submit funny, unique words you want to see in the newsletter (think: moist, whippersnapper, circumjacent, etc.), and it’ll be our responsibility to include one of these words somewhere in the Brew each day. While reading, you can guess what the Word of the Day is and we’ll reveal it in the Answer section.

But this requires your participation: After reading the newsletter, scroll back up and submit your word here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVn?mblid=d356f94d6904&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for Word of the Day. We’ll kick off a test run tomorrow.

The south pole of the moon is littered with craters, can get colder than –300 degrees Fahrenheit, and hasn’t seen a lick of sunlight in billions of years.

It’s also the trendiest destination in the solar system.

This week, Russia and India were racing to become the first countries to land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole, which, despite its hostile climate, could have significant commercial and geopolitical value for any Earthly power looking to extend its reach into space.

It didn’t go well for Russia. Yesterday, its Luna-25 spacecraft crashed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVr?mblid=579e8970d521&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> while attempting a moon landing, or as Russia’s dejected space agency put it, the vehicle “ceased to exist.” It’s a major setback for a country that was the first to land a spacecraft on the moon in 1966 but hadn’t launched a lunar mission in 47 years.

India’s up next: Its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft has arrived in the neighborhood and will try to touch down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVs?mblid=82ac921ec126&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Wednesday. If successful, it’d be a first for India and a credibility boost for its small-but-growing space program. India has set aside only $1.5 billion for its Department of Space, compared to NASA’s budget of ~$25 billion, per the WSJ.

But why go to the dark side of the moon?

Because there’s ice. Ice, which melts and turns into water, could be pivotal for two reasons:

It’s necessary for supporting human settlements in space, something NASA is trying to do with its Artemis missions in this decade.

Water could also be used to make rocket fuel, establishing the moon as a literal launching pad for missions to deeper parts of the solar system, like Mars.

Using the moon’s natural resources to sustain human colonies and dial up future launches is key to unlock the next generation of space exploration. Think about the $6 delivery fee for your Uber Eats order, and then consider the expense and time required to ship materials ~238,000 miles from the Earth to the moon.

“In-situ resource utilization,” which is the official term for exploiting the moon’s resources, is one area of the space industry where private sector companies see loads of opportunity. For example, Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin was just awarded a $35 million contract from NASA to develop solar cells out of lunar regolith, the crushed-up rock material that covers the entire lunar surface.

Desert areas east of the major cities that barely experience any precipitation, such as Palm Springs, CA, were soaked with more rainfall yesterday than they see in a couple of years. Hundreds of flights out of Las Vegas, San Diego, and Phoenix were canceled or delayed, while sporting events, concerts, and museums were closed. We were also given our first Word of the Day: hurriquake. As Hilary rained down on SoCal, a 5.1-magnitude earthquake shook the area, though no major damage was immediately reported.

In 7 games, Messi has put MLS on the map <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVA?mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Messi is hoisted up by his Inter Miami teamates after their victory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVA?mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images
In a little over a month since joining Inter Miami, Messi has far exceeded the lofty expectations set for him, boosting the fortunes of his team, Major League Soccer, and brands basking in the glow of his superstardom.

On Saturday night, Messi scored his tenth goal in seven games <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVB?mblid=24b277cf270a&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and his team, Inter Miami (which was really bad before he joined), won the Leagues Cup tournament in penalties. With his 44th trophy, Messi became the most decorated soccer player ever.

Apple: Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+ have more than doubled since Messi joined Inter Miami, one of the team owners tweeted. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a recent earnings call he “could not be happier with how the partnership is going.”

Jersey sales: Messi’s now-iconic pink Inter Miami jersey was the top seller <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=df317f9536e8&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> across all sports for Fanatics last month, the WaPo reported, and an Adidas spokesperson told Reuters that demand for Messi’s jersey in Miami “has been truly unprecedented.”

Ticket prices: Much like Swifties did for the Eras Tour, fans around the country have packed stadiums when Messi comes to town, sending ticket prices skyrocketing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVD?mblid=78e63c699616&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> more than 1,700% on resale sites. In a game that sans Messi would have drawn a sparse crowd, last week’s Philadeliphia vs. Inter Miami match had standing room only tickets going for $241 and field-level seats for $16,200 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=9f1968c2ae95&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Social media: Inter Miami’s Instagram account has grown to over 14 million followers, more than any team in the NFL, NHL, or MLB.

Bottom line: There may be one person benefiting most from Messi’s otherworldly play—Messi himself. Due to his unique contract structure with Inter Miami, Messi gets a cut of the revenue he brings in to Adidas and Apple.

Key performance indicators <#> GIF from Succession about bodega sushi being a bad choice Succession/HBO via Giphy
Stat: Unlike Tom Wambsgans, other Americans aren’t snobby about their sushi. The grocery store operator Kroger is the biggest purveyor of sushi <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVJ?mblid=cf5fccd01fef&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the country, selling more than 40 million pieces per year, according to the WSJ. The company realized it was No.1 back in 2020 and in the past three years has ramped up its sushi offerings to claim even more market share (“When customers think of sushi, we want them to think of Kroger,” one exec said). But it’s not just Kroger—grocery stores across the US are benefiting from consumers choosing an $8.99 California roll instead of an omakase date night. Sales volumes of sushi at US retailers have risen more than 50% in the past year, per Circana.

Although one scientist said the reconstructed recording “sounds a bit like they’re speaking underwater,” the breakthrough could one day help people with certain neurological conditions translate their silent thoughts into nonrobotic, natural-sounding speech that has rhythm and inflection, similar to music.

These sharks are besties. Great white sharks typically ride solo, so marine researchers are perplexed by the discovery that two have been found swimming together. The tracked sharks, named Jekyll and Simon, stayed within 10 to 100 miles of each other while moving north between April and July. The chief scientist at the nonprofit tracking the sharks said that since the beginning of his career in the 1970s, he’s never seen white sharks migrate together <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVg?mblid=92dac0976c47&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> like this. Blood samples will determine if the pair is related. If so, it could mean that family actually matters to the aquatic predators, who, until now, weren’t thought to care much about those ties.

What does mozzarella have in common with strep throat? Bacteria. It’s crucial to all cheeses, and microbiologists have finally identified the two microbes that make mozzarella taste the way it does: Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Why’d it take so long to unlock the secret to a standard pizza topping? The cheese has a pretty diverse microbial makeup. Plus, making mozz <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVh?mblid=af03c4699553&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is a delicate process that involves heating, ripening, and brining a mixture of milk from a water buffalo, natural whey starter, and curdled milk from a calf’s stomach, so even the slightest temperature or processing changes impact its microbiome and therefore its flavor.—ML

  Locals worry about getting displaced from fire-ravaged Maui <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUX?mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Lahaina street <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUX?mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Jon Hicks/Getty Images Last week, a devastating brush fire tore through Maui, reducing much of the historic town of Lāhainā to ashes and killing at least 111 people. But even as first response efforts were still underway, reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUY?mblid=5a58bd807aa9&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> began spreading on social media that outside investors were calling up locals, looking to snap up what’s left of Lāhaināns’ property, presumably with plans to redevelop the land.

Almost all of Lāhainā’s housing stock was lost to the flames, leaving up to 4,500 residents without a roof over their heads. And as the area seeks to rebuild, many longtime Mauians fear they could end up priced out of their hometown as it gets turned into a luxury enclave for moneyed mainlanders.

Those fears aren’t necessarily unfounded: The phenomenon is common when disasters hit desirable zip codes. Add to that Hawaii’s fraught history with outsiders and tensions around preserving Native Hawaiian culture, and the question of how to revive the area has become especially contentious.

The prospect of real estate developers paying below-market rates for the land was met with fierce backlash. Local activists flooded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUZ?mblid=62fda2450c0a&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> social media, invoking the history of Native Hawaiians’ land being obtained through predatory practices. The state’s governor even said he’s looking into imposing a moratorium on selling land to developers in the wake of the fire disaster.

Disaster gentrification

Unfortunately, a hot real estate market ravaged by a natural disaster can be a lucrative business opportunity. Developers can swoop in to buy land at a discount, sometimes due to the homeowners’ desperation to cash out their property. Insurance and aid payouts typically “don’t arrive the day after a tragedy,” yet families are immediately faced with relocation costs and other expenses, Sterling Higa, executive director of Housing Hawaii’s Future, explained to Morning Brew.

Prime vacation spots hit with environmental devastation have been gentrified in the past. Outside investors took advantage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aU-?mblid=15861504dbfb&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of Hurricane Irma in 2017 to accelerate tourism development on the Caribbean island of Barbuda, as the government helped them wrest control of coveted land from locals. And research shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aU_?mblid=f76a21a21bbb&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Florida communities affected by hurricanes saw higher home prices and tended to attract wealthier residents in the aftermath.

Maui risks facing a similar fate. The scenic island has long been a magnet for deep-pocketed part-time residents (Oprah Winfrey is among the island’s top landowners) and hordes of tourists. With not enough homes to go around, housing prices have skyrocketed and many locals employed in the dominant hospitality industry find themselves struggling to make ends meet.

* The pandemic hyper-boosted the real estate boom, pushing Maui County’s home prices up nearly 35% since 2019.

* The median price for a home on the island is currently around a million dollars, per Redfin.

An exodus of longtime residents from across the state, particularly Native Hawaiians, began even before the fire, with Las Vegas emerging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aV0?mblid=7fd9a5777e56&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as a popular destination, and the recent disaster could send more people packing.

But does it have to be that way?

Experts say there are ways to prioritize a recovery effort that keeps locals local.

“Keeping many [local] people close and as engaged as possible” during the rebuilding effort ought to be an overarching priority for the local government, Andrew Rumbach, climate disaster recovery researcher at the Urban Institute, told Morning Brew. He says providing temporary housing and other aid, while making sure locals are participating in recovery discussions, could compel more folks to stick around.

To prevent investors rushing in to buy up local land, Rumbach says Maui authorities could temporarily stop issuing building permits. But he thinks the government will ultimately have to focus on keeping home prices within reach of regular families on the island, by using recovery funds for various affordability programs and loosening zoning rules to expand housing supply.

Looking ahead…It usually takes years to rebuild housing after such a sweeping catastrophe: Rumbach noted that even in the exceptionally speedy recovery scenario of the Marshall Fire in Colorado, just 10% of the lost homes have been rebuilt 20 months later.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: ‘The Caribbean of Europe’ <#> A beach in Albania Zhang Liyun/Xinhua via Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Secret’s out about Albania.

The Balkan country is shedding its reputation as a haven for corruption and organized crime to emerge as the hot new vacation destination for Europeans. It’s got stunning beaches (the Albanian Riviera), nightlife <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVc?mblid=886ce6ba3ad6&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and striking natural landscapes…but its biggest selling point may be the low cost.

Billed as a cheaper alternative to European tourist meccas like Italy, Greece, and Croatia, the price of restaurants and hotels in Albania were 56% below <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVd?mblid=8cd8a5d6c22a&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> those in Germany, according to Germany’s federal statistics agency. The Financial Times calls Albania the “cheapest holiday destination in Europe.”

And people have noticed. Tourism to Albania has surged this year as budget-conscious travelers try to avoid the costs—and the crowds—of other Mediterranean hot spots.

* In June, airline passengers to Albania more than doubled from the previous year, per ACI Europe.

* Overnight stays by foreign tourists in Q1 2023 surged 152% from the same period in 2019, according to Eurostat.

If that sounds like an opportunity for Airbnb hosts, you’d be correct. The number of short-term rental listings has boomed 195% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVe?mblid=691f009d9d2c&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from January 2019 to May 2023, though even that hasn’t kept up with demand for nightly stays, which has shot up 543% in the same period, per data analyzed by AirDNA.

Bottom line: Albania remains one of the poorest countries in Europe. But its low cost and natural assets (30% of Europe’s flora!) are becoming hard to ignore for travelers priced out of places where The White Lotus is set. You might wanna get there before the influencers do.—NF

Good morning. The Women’s World Cup will conclude tomorrow with the finals between England and Spain at 6am ET.

While the USWNT have been out of the tournament for weeks, we Americans can live vicariously through England, which is moving hell and Earth to will their Lionesses to victory. Literally—the Church of England’s lead bishop for sport said that churches can push their Sunday services earlier to accommodate parishioners viewing the game, England’s biggest soccer match since 1966.

But if your Sunday morning vibe is more pub than pew, the UK government is also bending rules to make sure you’re well lubricated for the final, encouraging local councils to let bars open an hour earlier than usual (that’s 11am local time, when the match starts) for pregame festivities.

San Francisco wants to hit the brakes on robotaxis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUm?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> An autonomous vehicle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUm?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
A series of robots-are-dumb incidents in San Francisco this week has prompted officials to try to halt the recently approved expansion of self-driving taxis in the city.

General Motors-owned Cruise and Alphabet-owned Waymo have been offering driverless rides in the city for a while now, but service was limited until last week, when the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted their request to boost capacity and offer 24/7 commercial rides.

But after a week of Cruise vehicle mishaps that would land them in the Repair Ward if this were the WALL-Everse, the San Francisco City Attorney is asking the CPUC to press pause <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUn?mblid=a9e525af25e4&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Since the robotaxi expansion got the greenlight on August 10…

Ten driverless Cruise cars came to a stop <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUo?mblid=43ddfa789064&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and clogged an intersection near the Outside Lands Music Festival. The company said the vehicles stopped working because concertgoers overwhelmed cell networks, interrupting the cars’ communications.

Another Cruise car drove through a construction site and, in cartoon gag fashion, got stuck in wet concrete <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUp?mblid=b149a1ccfd69&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

A person was injured <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUq?mblid=0de5ed564c0f&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when the autonomous Cruise car they were riding in failed to yield to an oncoming fire truck, which was responding to an emergency.

Waymo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUr?mblid=4ba5689d0f27&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has had its fair share of incidents, too: Cars blocked a firehouse in May, struck and killed a dog the same month, and stopped in front of a public bus in March. But since last summer, autonomous car accidents have reportedly become rarer, likely because the vehicles learn how to react to certain situations as they encounter them.

The cab hail of the future: Even if the CPUC agrees to postpone the recent expansion, it would likely just be a road bump. App downloads for Cruise and Waymo surged this week, and the companies are gearing up to roll out fleets in Los Angeles, New York, Austin, and Miami.—ML

Hurricane Hilary appears headed for California. The storm swirling off the coast of Mexico yesterday prompted the first-ever tropical storm watch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUv?mblid=0cd907e13b73&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for Southern California. If it makes landfall in California (rather than slamming Mexico first) it’ll be the first such storm to hit the area since 1939. As the storm moves through over the coming days, more than a year’s worth of rain is predicted to fall in California, Arizona, and Nevada, creating a risk of flooding and other dangers.

Another day, another ominous sign for China’s economy. Chinese real estate megafirm Evergrande, which said in July it had lost $81 billion in the past two years, filed for US bankruptcy protection <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUw?mblid=922b2f9a9f5e&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as it seeks to restructure its debt around the globe. It’s not the only major Chinese real estate firm to suffer as the country struggles to recover economically from the pandemic. Plus, analysts questioned whether China was having its “Lehman moment” when asset manager Zhongrong Trust missed payments to corporate investors. China instituted new measures to try to shore up its stock market, but investors still sent Hong Kong (which has its own trading rules but includes many mainland companies) into bear market <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUx?mblid=7a64cb24bd59&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> territory.

The Panama Canal increasingly resembles a Taco Bell drive-thru on a typical Taco Tuesday. More than 200 ships are waiting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUz?mblid=21c3ed25623b&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their turn to glide through the global trade artery, and the Panama Canal Authority extended traffic restrictions this week, citing a historic lack of rainfall.

The usual 36 ships-per-day limit was slashed to 32 last month to save water, creating a backlog of idling vessels.

Wait times for large container ships have risen to 16–17 days— longer than it takes them to traverse the Pacific Ocean, one analyst told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUA?mblid=037eba69bb30&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Seatrade Maritime News.

Your shopping budget might get dried out, too

The canal carries a third of the maritime trade between the Americas and Asia, per the Wall Street Journal. Delays and a rule limiting some ships’ weight is already pushing up cargo costs, right as many companies ramp up delivery orders in preparation for this year’s holiday season. And those costs could get passed along, steepening your gift-giving bill.

We thought we were the only ones enjoying the sounds of thunder while we wrote this newsletter. But it turns out white noise podcasts are so popular that Spotify considered nixing them <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUF?mblid=5fbc38a4375b&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the platform to bring in an extra $38 million a year, according to an internal memo Bloomberg viewed.

Spotify’s document said that as of January 2023, white noise and ambient podcasts (think rainforest mixes, static, or even lawn mower sounds) made up “3 million daily consumption hours on the platform.”

But Spotify wasn’t making much money off these sounds, even as calming noise makers were raking in ~$18,000/month from the platform’s ads. All while Spotify’s algorithms were sending listeners their way thanks to an effort to push users to the talk-based programs (versus music) that Spotify was investing in heavily to boost subscriptions.

Ethereal box fans can rest easy (for now). While Spotify did consider a plan to thwart bird sound-looping freeloaders by removing white noise and banning future uploads, it didn’t end up going through with the plan to leave you with nothing to fall asleep to but Joe Rogan. Still, some static makers have complained in Reddit threads recently that their content occasionally disappears from the platform.—MM

And it’s affecting Danish currency. Per the WSJ, the weight-loss drugs’ strong US sales meant the company was converting unusually large amounts of dollars into kroner, raising the local currency’s value relative to the euro and spurring the central bank to lower interest rates to keep the exchange rate steady.

Good morning. Here’s a fact about playing cards that we’re intentionally telling you in the morning because you would not sleep if you learned about it close to bedtime. It comes from a TikTok video by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

He revealed that the possible number of ways you can shuffle a 52-card deck is so unfathomably large (52 factorial, or 52!) that you could gather 1 trillion people, hand each of them a deck of cards, tell them to shuffle it 1 trillion times per second for 1 trillion years, let that happen across 1 trillion civilizations in the universe, let that happen across 1 trillion universes…and a deck of cards you shuffled right now would only have a 40% chance of matching the sequence of any single one of the decks in this experiment.

From that understanding, you could make a strong claim that no two decks of cards in history, when properly shuffled, have had the same sequence.

Javier Milei’s radical plan to save Argentina’s economy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQb?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Javier Milei <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQb?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Luis Robayo/Getty Images
Who has five cloned dogs named after conservative economists and wants to permit the sale of human organs? The front-runner to be the next president of Argentina, that’s who.

Following his shocking presidential primary win on Sunday, far-right libertarian Javier Milei has been explaining his radical economic plan for Argentina in interviews. Milei, who before entering politics performed in a Rolling Stones cover band and played on a second-tier soccer team, has attracted comparisons to former President Trump for his anti-establishment rhetoric, calls to drain a swamp of the corrupt political elite, and curiously tousled hair (his nickname: The Wig).

While Milei has appealed to Argentines who are understandably fed up with their country’s flailing economy, investors are concerned he’s going to rock a boat that’s already on the verge of tipping over—the peso tumbled following his win and forced the government to devalue the currency by 18%.

The “anarcho-capitalist” approach

If you thought 9% inflation in the US was wild, consider the demolition of purchasing power in Argentina, where inflation is over 115%, the largest denomination peso banknote is worth under $3, and ice cream prices doubled in a month. The country, where 40% of the population lives in poverty, is headed for its sixth recession in 10 years. Milei supporters see his policy ideas as extreme but hope they would provide a necessary jolt to a broken system.

Here are some of the drastic actions Milei said he’d pursue if elected:

Dollarization, or the process of switching the national currency from pesos to the US dollar. Of note: The Argentine government tried a similar policy in the ’90s and it ended in disaster, but dollarization has seen some success in Ecuador and El Salvador.

Eliminating Argentina’s central bank, which he believes is the “worst garbage that exists on this Earth.”

Cutting government spending by shutting down public programs like the health, environment, and education ministries, as well as making citizens pay for the public healthcare system.

Looking ahead…Milei outperformed mainstream candidates in the primary, but the race is far from over. The presidential election is on October 22, and many experts predict a runoff election will need to be held on November 19.—CC

Tour de headlines <#> Walmart's logo with green arrows pointing up Francis Scialabba
Walmart is cooking. The US’ largest retailer posted a strong quarter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQf?mblid=321fdee9b75b&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for both profit and revenue in a sign Americans are maintaining their reputation as prolific shoppers. Walmart’s in an advantageous position right now because Americans are stocking up on essentials like groceries and health products—areas where the superstore can beat its competitors on price. Target and Home Depot, retailers that specialize in want-to-have items (as opposed to Walmart’s need-to-have), disappointed last quarter.

Housing affordability got even worse. About those surging bond yields we mentioned in the Markets section: They’re playing out in a nasty way in the housing market, where the average mortgage rate in the US jumped to 7.09% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQg?mblid=2bc56f7a7861&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, its highest level since 2002, per Freddie Mac. Combine those eye-watering borrowing costs with an inventory crunch that’s driven up prices, and you get the worst housing affordability <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQh?mblid=25780a2ea961&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> conditions in four decades, Bloomberg reports. Roughly 75% of US homeowners have mortgage rates of less than 4%, according to JPMorgan, so you can imagine why no one is eager to move and pay upward of 7% on a new place.

Retirement accounts are minting millionaires. It’s good to have money stashed in the stock market when the market is doing well. The number of people with at least $1 million in their 401(k) and IRA accounts jumped 12% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQi?mblid=9472a92a5dfb&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the second quarter, according to a report from Fidelity Investments, largely tracking the market’s gain during that period. It’s the third straight quarter of growth in $1+ million accounts and close to a record high. But start saving now, because building a hard-boiled nest egg through retirement accounts takes time: The average age of a 401(k) millionaire is 59, Fidelity said.

ENVIRONMENT

Maui officials say the island is “still open” for tourists <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQj?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wildfires reduced Lāhainā to rubble <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQj?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Robert Gauthier/Getty Images
In the wake of the Lāhainā wildfires that killed at least 111 people and destroyed the homes of thousands more, mixed messages are spotlighting long-standing tensions over Hawaii tourism.

Because of Maui’s reliance on tourism—which accounts for an estimated four out of every five dollars made there, according to the Maui Economic Development Board—officials like the Maui County mayor have rolled back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQk?mblid=94a2a93c4384&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their initial discouragement of all nonessential travel. They now say the rest of the island, excluding the fire-torn west side, is open for business, even as some Native Hawaiians tell visitors to stay away <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mblid=86fdc088e835&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. That’s left travelers unsure of how best to help.

Many west Maui residents, even those whose homes were destroyed, have resumed work in other parts of the island, but locals feel torn between needing to make money and not wanting tourists to visit right now. In a July survey of residents of four of the Hawaiian islands, 67% viewed tourism favorably but also agreed that the industry functions at the expense of locals.

This paradox is nothing new: Hawaii’s economic dependence on an industry that drains natural resources—like last summer’s prioritization of resort landscaping during a drought—has triggered anti-tourism protests in past years. Experts say the islands need a more diversified economic engine, and developing a “green fee” paid by tourists could also help.—ML

Within the last two years, Disney, UPS, and Virgin Atlantic reversed their bans on visible tattoos at work. Even the US Army, which didn’t allow soldiers to have tattoos until 2015, eased its bans on hand and neck tattoos last year.

Good morning. On this day in 1998, former President Clinton turned everyone’s minds into a pretzel when, during grand jury testimony over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, he mused, “It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.”

Truthfully, it’s been a while since preschool and we could use a little refresher. According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of “is” is “the present tense third-person singular of be.” And the definition of “be” is “to equal in meaning.”

Okay, not sure that helped.

ENTERTAINMENT

Music execs had nothing to do with songs of the summer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMD?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Oliver Anthony performing Rich Men North of Richmond and clip from Planet of the Bass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMD?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
Last summer, a Netflix show about D&D made an ’80s Kate Bush hit a contender for song of the season, but this summer two of the biggest biggest bops came from an even more surprising place: nowhere.

Eurodance parody “Planet of the Bass” and conservative favorite “Rich Men North of Richmond” are very different songs whose popularity skyrocketed for very different reasons—but both popped off without the help of traditional music labels.

If you’re still humming “Running Up That Hill”, here’s the scoop on these two:

A song about nothing. Brooklyn-based comedian Kyle Gordon (and his alter ego DJ Crazy Times) went viral with three teaser trailers for “Planet of the Bass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aME?mblid=7f14cf85cbcb&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” filmed by his brother on an iPhone. Gordon said he has no intention of becoming a pop star, but:

The official music video, released Tuesday, already has more than 860,000 views, and the first preview has 110+ million.

Gordon performed the song at a Jonas Brothers concert in Boston.

A song about a whole lot. Oliver Anthony’s “Rich Men North of Richmond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMF?mblid=17cccfe75f2e&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” was number one on Spotify’s Top 50 chart for the US yesterday, after debuting a little over a week ago on YouTube, where it’s racked up 16 million views. Anthony says he identifies “dead center down the aisle” politically, but the song’s hype owes a lot to conservatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Walsh, and Ben Shapiro, who praised its lyrics criticizing high taxes and welfare.

Some progressives have even accused Anthony of being an “industry plant” to carry the baton of Jason Aldean’s controversial chart topper, “Try That in a Small Town” or even have QAnon ties.

A pig kidney implanted into a human is still working after a month. In a big step toward using animals to help ease the shortage of donated organs, the surgical team at NYU Langone that transplanted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMK?mblid=13a7bdf57afe&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a genetically modified pig kidney into a brain-dead man (with his family’s consent) said it continues to function normally 32 days later. That’s the longest such an organ has worked inside a person, and it raises hopes that pig organs can one day help human patients in need of donations. As of March, when the US proposed revamping its organ donation system, more than 100,000 people were waiting for organs.

An appeals court ruled abortion pills should stay on the market. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit yesterday overturned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aML?mblid=b3fecbcdad62&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a Texas judge’s ruling revoking the FDA’s decades-old approval of mifepristone. However, the court said the drug should not be available through the mail or prescribed via telemedicine, which would make it unavailable in some states with abortion bans. The ruling will have no immediate impact on the accessibility of mifepristone because a Supreme Court order keeping it available until the justices weigh in was already in effect.

The scuttled purchase comes amid tension between the US and China over technology, especially chips which the Biden administration has worked to restrict China’s access to.

RETAIL

People are shopping more, just not at Target <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMN?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Target logo on a balloon with darts going toward it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMN?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
What’s up? Not sales at Target, which soared during the pandemic but, much like your family’s bonding time, have fallen off since. After the company revealed yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMO?mblid=8334760cc416&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that sales slumped last quarter for the first time in four years despite a profit surge, the retailer cut its profit forecast for the year.

Why the slump? Target said that lower sales last quarter are partially a result of the consumer backlash over its Pride collection…and over its removal of that Pride collection.

But culture wars aren’t the only problem for everyone’s favorite place to aimlessly spend $50: With prices for essentials rising, customers only have so much left to spend on seasonal oven mitts. Target is uniquely exposed to discretionary spending categories, which account <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMP?mblid=362ed236c477&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for 54% of its annual sales, according to the Wall Street Journal. As for things people do need, groceries only make up 20% of Target’s yearly revenue, compared to more than 50% of rival Walmart’s.

And even when customers are buying for fun, they’re hunting for bargains one strip mall over at TJ Maxx, whose parent company reported strong sales <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMQ?mblid=dc78a382dfdf&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and raised its outlook for the year yesterday, instead.

FOOD

Seems like nobody wants their food delivered anymore <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMU?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Person declining food delivery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMU?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
Fast-casual food delivery is becoming less popular as more people get their freaking arses up and opt for takeout or in-person dining.

The dip in delivery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMV?mblid=c5b0ccad0da6&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is largely because consumers are watching their wallets, analysts say. With pandemic lockdowns behind us, people can no longer justify paying the fees and inflated menu prices associated with clicking “Order” from the couch.

And some fast-casual chains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMW?mblid=727048563960&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> are getting nostalgic for the goblin mode days.

Sweetgreen has fulfilled fewer delivery orders and more pickups recently, and the salad chain fell short of overall revenue estimates last quarter.

Deliveries for health bowl competitor Cava have similarly declined, with pickups on the up. That contributed to the company’s cautious sales growth forecast for the year (but so have rising gas prices and other universal economic concerns).

Chipotle’s delivery revenue dropped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMX?mblid=a32baaf8a88f&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> 15.8% last quarter compared to the same time last year.

Companies that focus on delivery haven’t all been hit as hard. Uber’s delivery sales increased 14% and DoorDash’s grew 25% last quarter, but Grubhub’s parent company did report decreasing order volumes across North America this year.

Restaurants are trying to adapt: After struggling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMY?mblid=fd29d5741bcd&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with delivery for more than a year, Domino's finally agreed last month to partner with Uber Eats and Postmates.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> A VinFast electric car Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images
Stat: Quick, name a major car company. VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle startup that has yet to turn a profit, probably wasn’t the first to spring to mind. But after it went public via SPAC Tuesday, the company’s stock more than tripled, pushing its market value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aN0?mblid=4bfd8fd913f0&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to ~$86 billion as of the market’s close. That was higher than General Motors ($45.8 billion) or Ford ($47.9 billion). VinFast plunged 19% yesterday as investors weighed the challenges ahead for the company, but it showed the market still has an appetite for EV manufacturers and SPAC deals—even though several of both have stumbled recently.

Markets: Stocks fell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aJY?mblid=44c89aef61a0&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on a day that featured good and bad news for Wall Street (clearly, investors thought the news was bad on net). The good news was that US retail sales showed consumers shopped a lot more than expected last month, another checkmark on the economy’s bill of health. But that strong retail sales report also raised concerns that interest rates could remain elevated for longer, and Fitch Ratings also warned that it might have to downgrade dozens of banks, including JPMorgan.

Stock spotlight: Tesla stock is in need of a recharge after falling more than 20% from its July peak. Investors are peeved with Tesla’s extended price cuts in China and its plan to release lower-range Model X and Model S vehicles that are $10,000 cheaper than the standard versions.

President Biden’s historic clean energy push graduated from infancy into toddlerhood today: It’s been exactly a year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKG?mblid=355e31102c3e&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) became law.

Unlike what its inflation-taming name might suggest, the IRA is primarily about pouring an unprecedented amount of federal cash into speeding up clean tech adoption. The landmark legislation unlocks $394 billion of government funding and $367 billion in loans for environmental incentives including…

Tax credits and loans to companies that produce EV batteries, solar and wind energy equipment, as well as energy storage technology.

Up to $7,500 in tax rebates for drivers willing to ditch their gas guzzler for an EV.

Benefits for homeowners boosting the energy efficiency of their homes, and businesses and nonprofits that do the same with their spaces.

Other provisions aimed to offset a US government budget shortfall by lowering the prices Medicare pays for prescription drugs and tightening corporate tax rules.

The winners and losers

The Biden administration touts the IRA as a win for the environment, American workers, and companies building clean tech in the US.

The legislation already spurred major renewable energy manufacturers to invest $271 billion into projects nationwide and has created 29,780 jobs over the past year, according to the industry group the American Clean Power Association.

The US is also becoming an EV battery-making hub as carmakers have announced plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKH?mblid=d7ad14b32615&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to open new factories in Michigan, South Carolina, and New York.

But, as with any sweeping policy, someone will end up with the short end of the stick. “Made-in-America” sourcing requirements for some products to qualify for IRA incentives have made EU governments worried that clean tech produced in Europe is now less attractive to American consumers.

Meanwhile, a union representing 400,000 auto workers has been complaining that EV companies seeking to benefit from IRA funding can get away with providing less-than-desirable jobs for its members.

Looking ahead…while the IRA has already catalyzed some clean tech action, whether the law truly ushers in a renewables revolution will only be clear once there are more candles on its birthday cake.—SK

China is known to obscure economic data that it can’t brag about, but there’s very little good news to show off these days: Its economy is having a worse year than MLS defenses against Messi. Widespread real estate problems, flagging investment, and a potential descent into deflation spurred President Biden to call China’s economy a “ticking time bomb.”

The gender gap between men and women dying from alcohol is getting smaller. Research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month found that alcohol-related deaths among US women are growing faster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKu?mblid=33ba3999118f&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> than among men, a dangerous shift that is alarming public health experts.

The analysis, which looked at 20 years of CDC data, found that from 2018 to 2020, alcohol-related mortality rates for women jumped nearly 15% while men’s rose just under 13%. Men are still about 3x more likely to die from alcohol-related deaths.

What’s making women drink more? Marketing and all of those quippy “wine o’clock” Etsy shirts could be playing a big role <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKv?mblid=6919567c75dd&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in pushing women who want to appear successful to top off their glasses in the same way tobacco companies latched onto women's liberation to advertise cigarettes in the ’60s. Professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Katherine Keyes told NBC that middle-aged, high-income, and educated women are binge drinking the most.

Women really can have it all—even cirrhosis and liver disease. Doctors believe that women’s higher body fat percentage, hormonal fluctuations, and other health traits make their organs more susceptible to alcohol’s health risks.—MM

How much of a price hike would it take for you to give up ad-free access to every episode of Suits?

That’s the question major streaming platforms are pondering as they’ve jacked up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKA?mblid=3c79441c9af6&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> subscription prices by 25% on average, per the Wall Street Journal. A basket of streaming services will cost $87 per month this fall, up from $73 a year ago, according to the Financial Times. The average cable package: $83.

Whatever happened to cheap bingeing? Most platforms (except Netflix) have been operating at a loss, pouring tens of billions into creating a bottomless supply of content. But rising interest rates and impatient shareholders have forced streaming services to answer for their debts, ending an era in which those companies were more focused on adding subscribers than on making money.

Still, streamers are betting you’d prefer to watch the new House of the Dragon season without being interrupted by Swiffer ads—and they may be right. In March, 94% of Disney+ subscribers opted to absorb a $3-per-month increase rather than switch to an ad-supported plan.

Zoom out: Analysts warn that the combo of higher prices and fewer new shows (if any, due to the Hollywood strike) could lead to subscriber losses, but media companies remain bullish that streaming is the future. July was the first month that cable accounted for less than 50% of all TV watching, while streaming accounted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKB?mblid=eadc065cf78a&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for a record 39%, according to Nielsen.—CC

Stat: Homelessness is surging in America <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aJ_?mblid=f7a4756bb18f&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The number of homeless people in the US has increased 11% so far this year over 2022, which would be the biggest jump by far in equivalent government records beginning in 2007, according to a WSJ analysis (the next highest increase was 2.7% in 2019, not including noisy pandemic data). Nonprofits and government agencies say the alarming rise in homelessness can be attributed to the lack of affordable housing and rental units, and the ongoing opioid crisis.

Michael Oher claims The Blind Side’s premise is a lie <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGA?mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Michael Oher with Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGA?mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Matthew Sharpe/Getty Images
Retired NFL player Michael Oher says the popular movie and book about his about his adoption by a White couple when he was a teenager in need of a stable home are based on a recently discovered lie, according to a court filing that accuses Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of never adopting him and cheating him out of millions of dollars.

Oher alleges that the Tuohys, portrayed by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw in the film, had him sign conservatorship papers soon after his 18th birthday that he believed made him a member of their family, ESPN reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGB?mblid=41cee2f432e4&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Instead, Oher’s lawsuit claims his lawyer uncovered the documents in February and learned that they merely gave the couple the rights to make business deals in his name.

According to Oher’s court filing…

He was paid nothing for The Blind Side film. Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy negotiated a deal that made them and their two biological kids $225,000 each, plus 2.5% of net proceeds from the film, which grossed more than $300 million.

A contract that Oher does not remember having explained to him gave 20th Century Fox Studios the rights to his life story with no compensation. Oher’s agent on the deal was a good friend of the Tuohys who also filed the conservatorship petition.

Sean Tuohy responded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGC?mblid=75e072269449&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to the allegations, telling The Daily Memphian, “It’s upsetting to think we would make money off any of our children.” He says he is “of course” willing to end the conservatorship and claims Oher got a share of the movie’s profits equal to other family members’.

Oher has never been a fan of the film. He has said it made people think that he was unintelligent and hurt his football career. “The story has also been a large source of some of my deepest hurt and pain over the past 14 years,” he wrote in a new book, released last week.—ML

New Illinois law protects child influencers. Children who work in Hollywood have long benefited from a California law requiring that a percentage of their money be put aside for them, and now a new state law <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGG?mblid=ce312f75ba71&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in Illinois intends to offer protection for young social media stars. The law, which was signed last week and will take effect in July 2024, requires that a portion of the money anyone under 16 makes on monetized online platforms (including in their parents’ content) be put into a trust for them until they turn 18. The law is the first of its kind in the US, but other states may follow: Washington is already considering a similar measure.

Hollywood reportedly offers concessions on AI, streaming data to striking writers. Last week, studios resumed negotiations with the Writers Guild of America, whose members walked off the job in May. And insiders told Bloomberg that the latest counterproposal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGH?mblid=f675f358d43f&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers promises the writers that humans, not artificial intelligence, will be credited for screenplays and that writers will get access to data on how many hours viewers spend streaming so they can gauge the popularity of their work (the offer also includes a pay bump). The two sides are expected to continue discussions this week.

Elon Musk and Zuck are still fighting (with words). Only one day after Mark Zuckerberg declared it “time to move on” from the cage match he and fellow Big Tech CEO Musk have been needling each other over on their respective platforms, Musk revealed he wasn’t ready to let it go. Musk tweeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGI?mblid=7449f177edf6&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that he’d be test-driving a Tesla to his rival’s house to knock on the door and fight—and livestream the action. But a Meta spokesperson said he wouldn’t find much there since Zuck is out of town and “takes this sport seriously and isn’t going to fight someone who randomly shows up at his house.”

In a huge dub for youths, yesterday a Montana state court ruled in favor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGK?mblid=82642ff84115&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of young people who claimed the state violated their right to a clean environment by allowing the proliferation of fossil fuels without checking their impact on climate change.

The case was the first of its kind to go to trial, but similar suits are pending throughout the US.

The lawsuit hinged on two things:

Part of the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) that made it illegal for regulators to consider how new mining projects would contribute to climate change.

A clause in Montana’s state constitution saying the state will “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.”

The judge determined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGL?mblid=b37c2925915b&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the MEPA provision violated Montana’s environmental guarantee because the state’s fossil fuel emissions contributed to climate change, causing injury to the plaintiffs—including heightened respiratory complications from wildfire smoke and other natural disasters caused by climate change.

Big picture: Our Children’s Trust, the nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs, called the decision a “sweeping” victory, though the state is likely to appeal. Experts believe this could set a precedent for future climate litigation, including a pending federal case, but it’s unclear how the issue would ultimately fare before the Supreme Court.—CC

Stat: If you’ve ever rolled your eyes when that friend who always seems to be posting pics from a White Lotus-type resort referred to their financial situation as “comfortable,” you were probably justified. Bloomberg surveyed ~1,000 Americans who make at least $175k a year (the amount that puts you in the richest 10% of US taxpayers), and half described themselves that way. Plus, a quarter reported they felt “very poor,” “poor,” or “getting by but things are tight.” In case you were wondering whether you’re that friend, Bloomberg also created a handy tool <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGU?mblid=2b69c65a54a8&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to tell you how your income stacks up in your area and where you could move to feel richer.

Quote: “The technology is very sophisticated. You don’t feel like you have a layer of sunscreen on, and it kind of just feels like you’re putting on a moisturizer in that sense, which makes it easier to use.”

According to the New York Times, you can count Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among the fans of cult favorite Bioré sunblock, which includes ingredients not approved for US use. That’s not unusual <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGV?mblid=24134b697d52&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for an anti-sun cream since the US has only approved 14 sunscreen filters, while the EU allows more than 30. The EU and several Asian countries (including Japan, where Bioré comes from) regulate sun protection as cosmetics, while the US FDA considers it an OTC drug—and hasn’t approved new active ingredients for sunblock in over 20 years. But AOC isn’t just incorporating foreign brands into her skincare routine: She says Congress has also taken preliminary steps to address improving the approval process.

Good morning.

But winter is coming. Last Thursday was the final post-8pm sunset here in NYC until May 2024.

Frustration grows in Maui over wildfire response <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> In an aerial view, two men ride a scooter s by businesses that were destroyed by a wildfire on August 11, 2023 in Lahaina, Hawaii. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
Residents of West Maui are increasingly voicing their concerns with the government’s response to catastrophic wildfires that have devastated the town of Lahaina and killed at least 93 people, making it the deadliest US wildfire in over a century.

Locals told the NYT that community-run volunteer groups have been far more helpful <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDv?mblid=a2d2460e64e1&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in providing resources for evacuees than the taxpayer-funded government, which they claim has been uncommunicative and blocked roads leading to Lahaina, stymying aid for the bustling city that burned down in the fire.

Government officials defended their response and said Maui’s remoteness is hampering relief efforts.

As of Saturday, just 3% of the impacted area had been searched, so the death toll could rise “significantly,” Hawaii Governor Josh Green said.

Prominent Hawaiians tell tourists to stay away

On Instagram, Native Hawaiian Jason Momoa echoed calls from local officials and told people to cancel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDw?mblid=d5672897a5a6&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their upcoming Maui vacations. “Do not convince yourself that your presence is needed on an island that is suffering this deeply,” the Aquaman actor wrote.

Momoa’s plea highlights the complicated relationship between tourists and locals, who rely on tourism for 80% of all income generated on Maui. The response to the fire has exacerbated the divide, with one angry resident telling the BBC she saw visitors swimming in the water that “our people just died in three days ago.” Locals also worry that rebuilding Lahaina could result in more territory ceded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDx?mblid=ed3ae59048ef&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to outside real estate developers already displacing families by fueling higher housing prices.

On Friday, CNBC Executive Editor Jay Yarow tweeted that a Tesla he had totaled last year was now in southern Ukraine, and the new owner was listening to Drake on Yarow’s Spotify account.

Yarow’s story went viral, offering a crash course <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDL?mblid=b567415ea598&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on the security risks associated with cars that have evolved into computers-on-wheels.

So, how did the Tesla end up in Ukraine? CNBC reporters tracked down what happened to their editor’s car. Online auction site Copart, which partners with salvage yards, scooped up the Tesla after it was totaled and listed it for sale. Someone in Ukraine appears to have won the bid, and the car was shipped from New Jersey to Europe, where its new owner was able to access Yarow’s personal Spotify playlists.

Yarow contacted Tesla to see how he could log out of his former car, and the company instructed him to disconnect the vehicle from his account. But several steps (like entering new owner information) were impossible, and simply disconnecting an account from the car does not prevent your data from being extracted, experts told CNBC. Tesla should have had a “wipe all my info from this car” feature long ago, they said.

Big picture: In the age of internet-connected vehicles, consumers might want to be more cautious about syncing data from their phones onto their car apps. You never know who’s going to get in the driver’s seat next.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Willem Dafoe saying Spider-Man/Sony Pictures Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even improve your memory while you sleep.

Sleep smells boost memory. If you’ve ever teased someone for using an oil diffuser at night, they will not forget it. New research has found an overwhelmingly positive correlation between cognitive performance and sniffing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC7?mblid=6f0c92b37277&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> full-strength natural oils while sleeping. In a trial, adults between 60 and 85 turned on a diffuser before bedtime and slept with any natural oil scent for two hours per night for six months. They performed 226% better on a memory test than those in the control group, according to the study out of the University of California, Irvine. The researchers say their findings mean that smell therapies, which are sometimes used with dementia patients, could be deployed overnight instead of taking up waking hours.

Mood might be key to charitable giving. A recent study indicates that people donate to charity when they’re already feeling happy, which differs from the common theory that people get a happiness boost after donating to charity. By analyzing tweets from more than 20,000 Twitter users who contributed to Wikipedia, researchers found an increase in positive-emotion language up to an hour before donations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC8?mblid=9cfde17f6be0&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> took place, followed by a return to neutral happiness levels. But they also say their findings are limited by only assessing tweets. Some happy donors might just be more likely to post about their charity work online, whereas other donors (who might feel happy or sad or neither) might keep it to themselves.

Don’t eat these square watermelons. Every few years, it seems our social media feeds obsess anew over Japan’s aesthetically pleasing cube-shaped watermelons <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC9?mblid=5ac3d2f44d60&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, as they did last weekend. The first square watermelon was grown in 1975 in Zentsuji, Japan, simply by putting a budding melon in a transparent box—no special seeds required. And because the fruits grow into whatever shape they’re forced into, triangular and heart-shaped watermelons can also be found in Japan. But before you drop up to $800 to get one shipped to your kitchen counter, you should know they’re practically inedible. Square watermelons are picked before they’re ripe in order to last as prized display items for longer, so you wouldn’t enjoy eating the expensive status symbols (though that didn’t stop this guy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aCa?mblid=efbd3155deb9&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>).—ML

  How to harness pollution to fight climate change <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cargo ship belching pollution <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Felix Cesare/Getty Images Cargo ships spewing plumes of sulfuric smoke sounds like something worthy of an indignant “How dare you?” from Greta Thunberg.

But this type of pollution might actually have been slowing climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Sulfur-spitting ships leave a cloud trail that can function as a jumbo beach umbrella, temporarily keeping the ocean waters cool by reflecting sunlight.

How do we know? As science vlogger Hank Green recently spotlighted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az_?mblid=3413e804d3fe&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, we’ve all been involved in a massive, accidental experiment in geoengineering—the controversial concept of altering the Earth’s environment to curb climate change—and we didn’t even know it.

In 2020, a new UN rule for fuels that the shipping industry could use took effect, and ships now belch out over 80% less sulfur. While reducing emissions of a chemical that’s harmful to human health is a win for everyone, it’s also become an unintended field test demonstrating how chemical clouds could be used to keep the Earth from overheating.

* Some scientists believe the new absence of these clouds partially caused this year’s record-breaking summer temps in the Atlantic Ocean.

* Although other factors like El Niño and the eruption of an underwater volcano in the Pacific Ocean last year likely played a role, the reduction of sulfur dioxide clouds is believed to be one of the reasons oceans have been so hot, causing record temperatures on land.

While the human-caused phenomenon is unintentional, some experts have long considered making reflective clouds deliberately (or boosting existing ones) to stave off global warming—even though the planet-scale risks of this approach keep it from becoming most scientists’ Plan A for climate change.

The Pandora’s box of climate engineering

Sucking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, aka carbon removal, is the least contentious geoengineering tool. Experts disagree over how well it works, but no one is worried it’ll turn our planet into an IRL environmental apocalypse film.

The same can’t be said about repelling sunrays by spraying sulfur aerosol into the stratosphere or enriching ocean clouds with sea salt to make them more reflective. Many climate scientists believe these methods are too risky since their effects aren’t entirely predictable and won’t be uniform across the planet. Others see geoengineering as a distraction from efforts to cut carbon emissions.

In a simulation run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, using sulfuric aerosols as a sun blocker made winters rainier in Scandinavia and drier in Mediterranean Europe. This would be disruptive to local agriculture and ecosystems. These disparate effects are bound to be a big sticking point in international relations, threatening to turn every UN meeting into a screaming match over who controls the “global thermostat.”

Researchers also warn that once humanity embarks on the path of artificial sunlight reflection, it might be hard to turn back— studies suggest that ceasing a geoengineering effort abruptly could cause major climate trouble.

Not all experiments are accidents

Some private companies have undertaken small-scale efforts to test sun ray-reflecting technologies.

One researcher from the UK teamed up with a space startup, European Astrotech, to test a system called “stratospheric aerosol transport and nucleation” (the acronym probably isn’t the best for a controversial emerging tech: SATAN). With a $1,000 balloon system, it achieved what might’ve been the first successful delivery of sun-blocking aerosols to the stratosphere, according to unpublicized reporting obtained by the MIT Technology Review.

Though the experiment was properly permitted and released just 400 grams of sulfur, scientists opposed to these efforts are unsettled by the fact that someone with a bit of cash and a startup partner is testing tech that could change the weather with minimal oversight.

It’s now not a matter of if but when geoengineering happens, climate economist and geoengineering research proponent Gernot Wagner told Morning Brew. He thinks scientists should investigate potential effects now so that the world isn’t blindsided when some nation decides to plow ahead with it.

The government is taking geoengineering seriously…the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently released a report outlining what research could be done to evaluate the risks and benefits of the technology.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: The Iowa State Fair <#> Albert the super bull, which weighs 3,042 pounds, is taken for a walk by Randy Dreher at the Iowa State Fair Scott Olson/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Opened August 10 and running through next weekend, the sprawling Iowa State Fair is an annual celebration of agriculture, American democracy, and fried foods on a stick.

While every state thinks its late-summer fair is the best, Iowa’s (est. 1854) stands out from the pack. Here’s why.

Creative competitions:

* The state fair’s husband calling contest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAb?mblid=e9c2fd0bba90&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> goes viral every few months, and it is personally one of my favorite videos ever.

* The Mr. Legs contest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAc?mblid=f8acb0dc424b&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> awards the man at the fair who’s got the best legs.

* Bagging groceries becomes a full-contact sport in a competition that judges contestants based on speed, proper item arrangement, and weight distribution among bags (underrated skill).

* And you can’t miss the butter cow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAd?mblid=486a766622dc&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Creative food: Do not come to the Iowa State Fair if you prefer eating with utensils, because here, any food you can imagine—hard-boiled eggs, pickles, edible cookie dough, deep-fried strawberry shortcake—comes served on a stick. No matter what freshly impaled foods you try, you should always save room for the pork chop on a stick, ranked the No. 1 Iowa State Fair dish <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAe?mblid=888cca563aca&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Des Moines Register readers. Checks out: Iowa is the top US state for pork production.

Politics: You might think wandering around a fairground would help you avoid the political news cycle, but at the Iowa State Fair, there’s no escape. Because of Iowa’s traditional role as the first state to vote in presidential primaries, candidates head to the fair the year before an election to schmooze with voters. Though Democrats booted their Iowa caucuses to later in the calendar this year, the state is still up first for Republicans in January. This year, 13 presidential candidates are scheduled to hit the fair’s Soapbox stage.—NF

A hub for Hawaiian heritage has burned to the ground <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az8?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Maui town of Lāhainā was largely destroyed in a wildfire. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az8?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images
The Maui town of Lāhainā will never be the same. This week, unprecedented wildfires ripped through the historic area where the Hawaiian Kingdom’s constitution was drafted, destroying cherished cultural sites.

The blazes are now mostly contained, but at least 53 people have died, making this one of the deadliest US wildfires in decades. The death toll is likely to rise as search and rescue efforts continue. An investigation into the cause of the fire has not yet begun, but unmanaged, nonnative grasslands are believed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az9?mblid=f1f211e0e28d&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to have fueled its spread, combined with dry air, drought, and winds from a passing hurricane.

“The whole town was devastated. Lāhainā was decimated,” Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aza?mblid=b7c18c98ef93&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. At least 1,000 buildings have been wrecked.

Front Street, the town’s popular stretch of restaurants, bars, and stores, has been reduced to ash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azb?mblid=09e5efccfda3&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. “Pretty much everybody I know lost everything,” one resident told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azc?mblid=e19d29eebf54&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> MSNBC.

The town center—one of 60 nationally recognized historic sites in the area—was destroyed, as was the church where Christianity got its start in Hawaii in the early 1800s. Its graveyard is the burial site for some members of old Hawaiian royalty.

The largest banyan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azd?mblid=79189a99f37b&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> fig tree in the US, planted in Lāhainā in 1873, is charred but still standing.

Burnt docks and wrecked boats have complicated seaborne relief efforts. Several airlines have added flights to help get people out of Maui.

The recovery…will take years, authorities said. Maui’s economy, which was just bouncing back after the pandemic, will suffer—80% of the island’s money is generated by tourism. Lāhainā, once the capital of pre-colonized Hawaii, was a major destination for visitors.—ML

Thanks to a US–Iran swap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azy?mblid=3f1a8042ae76&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, five Iranian American dual citizens held in the notoriously brutal Evin Prison in Tehran have been moved to house arrest, according to a lawyer for one of them, and they’ll soon be allowed to leave the country. In exchange, the US promised to release multiple Iranians incarcerated for violating sanctions and will allow Iran to use $6 billion of frozen funds for humanitarian purposes, multiple news outlets reported. The agreement comes as a number of Americans remain in foreign prisons on dubious charges, including WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is detained in Russia.

Amazon puts WFH employees on notice The e-commerce giant emailed some employees <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azz?mblid=1a547fece7fb&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to warn them that, based on their badge swipes, they hadn’t been coming into the office at least three days a week as mandated by company policy, Insider reported. But several employees claimed they were flagged erroneously, and Amazon admitted it might be true. The company’s Slack was popping off with employees venting about what they perceived as a tone-deaf email and a lack of transparency around how the tracking worked, per Insider. When Amazon’s return-to-office policy was imposed in February, some employees walked out in protest and circulated a petition to nix it.

EDUCATION

Colleges are spending money they don’t have <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azk?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of a college building on top of stacks of money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azk?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The price of college is rising, and for once, we can’t blame inflation. Spending increased <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azl?mblid=4ab242a1809a&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by 38% at the median flagship school (the best known and usually the oldest public university in each state) between 2002 and 2022—and they passed the tab to students, contributing to the $1.6 trillion student debt crisis, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis of the 50 schools’ financial statements.

Driving the increase: Over the 20 years analyzed, the median flagship’s salaries and benefits rose by ~40%, spending on athletic coaches jumped by 50%, and millions of dollars were pumped into new construction and renovations, according to data the WSJ analyzed from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database. Administrative costs have also become a greater share <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azm?mblid=115a21697559&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of institutional spending, per US News and the National Center for Education Statistics.

But that shiny new student union and all those higher salaries don’t pay for themselves. To afford them, every school in the Wall Street Journal’s analysis increased tuition and fee revenue per student by double digits from 2002–2022:

At the University of Oklahoma, tuition and fees per student rose 166% in the two decades analyzed.

Penn State, the most expensive flagship state school, costs the average student nearly $27,000 a year.

Big picture: Schools are spending so much because there’s no one to stop them. Economist James V. Koch found that trustees approve 98% of cost-increasing proposals at large public universities, and Holden Thorp, former chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the WSJ that universities are just “devouring money.”—CC

REAL ESTATE

If New York is dead, why is our rent so high? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azq?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Two headlines next to each other. One reads “New York City is dead forever” from The New York Post on August 17, 2020. The other reads “The average Manhattan rent just hit a new record of $5,588 a month” from MSNBC on August 10, 2023. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azq?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York Post & MSNBC
It wasn’t just your LA friends—everyone thought the pandemic would officially kill New York City. But apparently, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger: The city’s rents have rebounded…and then some.

Average rents in Manhattan hit a record high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azr?mblid=b492864863f0&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of $5,588 in July, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. It’s also the fourth month of record-breaking prices in the last five months, according to CNBC.

During the pandemic-triggered remote work revolution, economists warned that workers would flee to more affordable states and devastate the city’s real estate market. But despite nearly 400,000 people leaving Manhattan between June 2020 and June 2022, the average rent for apartments in the borough is now 30% higher than it was in 2019.

What happened? For starters, there’s still not enough housing on the island. And soaring interest rates are making it a lot more expensive for people to buy, so they are being pushed back into the rental market, giving prices an even bigger lift. Plus, the cost of housing in the city typically climbs throughout the summer so, spoiler alert: This month will likely break records too.

Record rental prices show that people are choosing to live in Manhattan despite not going in to work there. Manhattan offices were only at 48% of capacity last month, according to Kastle Systems.—MM

The author says that Mickelson made 858 wagers of $220,000 and more than 1,100 wagers of $110,000 between 2010 and 2014. He even attempted to bet $400,000 on Team USA (which he was playing on) at the 2012 Ryder Cup.

The music genre that’s said to have begun at a back-to-school party in the Bronx is celebrating its 50th birthday this weekend.

Hip-hop has grown from a style of musical expression for young people living among poverty and crime to the most popular music genre in the US and a worldwide phenomenon whose influence can be seen in everything from a house party playlist to the courtside seats at a Brooklyn Nets game.

It’s a surprising economic force

Music history experts say that hip-hop’s impact on the $16 billion music industry is so extensive that it’s not easily quantifiable. But even Run-DMC—one of the most influential hip-hop groups in history—struggled in the genre’s early days. “Nobody involved in Bronx hip-hop made big money,” Fordham University history professor Mark Naison told the Associated Press. But in 1986, Run DMC released “My Adidas,” and then an endorsement deal followed…and everything changed.

Since then, Jay-Z, Sean Combs, and Dr. Dre are a few of the dominant players in hip-hop leveraged their celebrity status to start companies, build brands, and amass millions (or in the case of Jay-Z and Combs, billions) of dollars:

Dr. Dre sold Beats Electronics to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion. It’s Apple’s largest acquisition to date.

Some of Jay-Z’s most valuable assets are Armand de Brignac, a luxury champagne line, and his entertainment agency, Roc Nation.

Diddy, up until June, had a partnership with liquor company Diageo. He also founded Bad Boy Records, which was worth $100 million at its height, according to Insider.

Puma, Nike, and Reebok have partnerships with hip-hop stars Rihanna, Travis Scott, and Cardi B, respectively.

Late fashion designer Virgil Abloh found fame with his line Off-White, which gained popularity with hip-hop icons. Luxury conglomerate LVMH acquired 60% of Off-White in 2021.

Looking ahead…industry experts predict that the genre’s economic impact will only increase in the future as brands continue to explore relationships with musicians.—CC

Disney’s streaming services are about to get pricier. The cost of ad-free versions are going up on October 12: Disney+ by 27% and Hulu by 20%, though in good news for cheapskates, the lowest-tier plans will stay the same. The House of Mouse revealed the price hikes after reporting mixed results <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awb?mblid=5ad903edc0f7&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the second quarter—including that it’s still losing subscribers (though most of those were from Disney+ Hotstar, which took a beating after losing cricket broadcast rights in India). Disney’s losses from streaming lessened last quarter, and the company is trying to make it profitable by September 2024.

Economic trouble alert from China. While most of the world is worried about inflation, China has the opposite issue: Consumer prices there fell 0.3% last month compared to 2022. Economists attribute the deflation to weak demand caused by record youth unemployment, an embattled housing market, and fewer exports. Chinese factories churned out an oversupply of products, making producer prices fall as well. That could help ease inflation in the US and Europe, but a prolonged slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy would spell trouble for global economic health. In another economic blow to China, President Biden signed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awc?mblid=02665b787811&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an order yesterday restricting US investment in certain Chinese technology.

Twitter was a major platform for Trump until he was kicked off the app in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” restored Trump’s account after he bought Twitter (now called X), but Trump has not tweeted since.

Hawaii is battling wind-swept wildfires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wildfires burn in Hawaii <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Senator Tim Richards/Facebook
Fires tearing through parts of Maui and Hawaii’s Big Island this week have killed at least six people, stranded thousands, and reduced much of a historic town to ash.

The Maui town of Lāhainā—a tourist destination and nationally recognized historical landmark—has been largely destroyed. Hundreds of families were displaced, and the US Coast Guard rescued at least 12 people who jumped into the ocean to escape the fire.

Meanwhile, Maui hospitals were inundated with injuries but not equipped for “extensive burn treatment,” according to Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, so some people have been airlifted to Oahu.

Sixty-mile-per-hour gusts partially due to a passing Category 4 hurricane fanned the blazes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awf?mblid=302bd9d0c6ef&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, blocked roads, and grounded firefighting helicopters.

Downed cell towers have also left authorities reliant on satellite phones to communicate with people in scorched areas.

Hawaii is forecast to be at an above-average risk of wildfires through November, but fires were rare in the region before humans arrived—making them especially damaging when they do hit.

So today, Virgin Galactic is sending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awk?mblid=25a9f54553af&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the first mother-daughter pair to space together on its second commercial flight.

The Galactic 02 mission, which will last about 70 minutes (just shy of a full viewing of March of the Penguins) and include a few minutes of zero gravity, is set to leave the New Mexico desert around 11am ET. And the lucky contest winner, Keisha Schahaff, is taking her daughter Anastatia Mayers as her  plus-one. They will also be the first people from the Caribbean to go to space.

Eighty-year-old Olympic canoeist Jon Goodwin will also be on the flight. He will be the first Olympian and second person with Parkinson’s disease to go to space.

Space is a vast business: For most of us, a contest is probably the most likely way to visit the stars. Tickets on a Virgin Galactic flight have reached as much as $450,000, which is pretty cheap compared to SpaceX’s $55 million and Blue Origin’s purported $28 million ticket prices.—MM

Though he’s unquestionably a star, Porter said he hasn’t made “f— you money” yet, and that both a new movie and a new television show he was set to be in were not happening because of the ongoing labor struggle. Referring to the anonymous studio exec who said the plan was to starve the strikers out, Porter made it clear that he’s plenty hungry.

Good morning. The writing gang is all in town for the Brew’s summer party this week, and after a randomized controlled trial lasting one day, we can conclude that in-person work does not boost productivity. But it does lead to a statistically significant rise in tossing around a ball and debating the various smells of NYC vs. Chicago from our desks.

HEALTH

Wegovy might do more than help people lose weight <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wegovy packages <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Picture Alliance/Getty Images
The hyped anti-obesity drug from Novo Nordisk was found to cut the risk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atg?mblid=edec8e44bb10&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of major cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attacks, by a whopping 20%, the company announced yesterday.

These findings, which came from a late-stage clinical trial, are important for two reasons:

They show that Wegovy could be more than a lifestyle drug that helps people shed pounds. It also has considerable benefits for heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the US.

And, given those wider benefits, insurance companies and Medicare could feel pressured to start covering the popular, pricey medication, which many insurers have avoided since it wasn’t deemed essential to overall health. Wegovy costs over $1,300 per month for weekly injections.

The reaction:

“If they play baseball in Denmark, Wegovy just hit a home run,” Barclays analyst Emily Field wrote <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ath?mblid=dd0e579ce6dc&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, referencing Novo Nordisk’s Danish home base. (Just checked: They don’t seem to play much baseball in Denmark.)

Others went further, declaring these findings amounted to a grand slam <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ati?mblid=9e4f738cf101&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The study means that Wegovy and a similar drug from Eli Lilly (Mounjaro) will easily become the “top-selling pharmaceuticals in history,” Barron’s gushed. And investors are betting they will be, too.

Novo Nordisk gained $60 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atj?mblid=fe8070102da1&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in market cap yesterday to close in on luxury conglomerate LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, per Bloomberg.

Eli Lilly also got a big boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atk?mblid=cd78af55792f&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from its bullish earnings report and the Novo Nordisk results. Shares of the world’s largest healthcare company soared 15% to a record high yesterday.

Big picture: A new class of superdrug that significantly reduces weight, cuts the risk of heart attacks, and offers numerous other unexplored benefits (like curbing addiction <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74-?mblid=c35b004e94ab&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>) could herald an exciting new era for public health.

But don’t count your chickens, etc., etc….Supply has been constrained amid a celebrity-powered frenzy for these drugs, there can be serious side effects, and the most recent study showing cardiovascular benefits hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.—NF

Following the news, Penn stock spiked ~13% in after-hours trading.

WeWork said it could go bankrupt. The coworking company that was valued at $47 billion just four years ago warned yesterday there was “substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” which in English means its finances are in such a deep hole it could soon file for bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atX?mblid=83a3260256d5&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Americans are spending like they’re Isla Fisher in a 2009 rom-com. A new report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/att?mblid=7f22d6f88d97&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that Americans charged more than ever to their credit cards last quarter, bringing credit card debt to over $1 trillion for the first time.

Booming credit card debt is the result of higher prices caused by inflation, rising interest rates, and strong consumer confidence, as well as 24 million new credit cards issued in the last quarter.

As debt has risen, so have late payments: The report found that in Q2, 7.2% of credit card accounts were 30 days overdue—the highest level in 11 years—and delinquency rates rose to 3.18% (up from 3%).

Yes, but…according to the Fed, neither of these numbers is shocking. Delinquency rates are returning to pre-pandemic levels after plummeting in 2020 when everyone collected stimulus checks and saved money.

Big picture: While $1 trillion in credit card debt seems alarming, economists are as unbothered as the guy holding up the line at Chipotle. Consumer debt is still just 6% of total deposits Americans have in their bank accounts, the lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atu?mblid=760832f5186b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> percentage in 20 years, per Axios.

But the digital gallery’s designer, who also created the educational Holocaust game The Light in the Darkness, tweeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atz?mblid=7d04519187f7&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that this museum—existing separately from Fortnite’s main play—will be “game changing” for Holocaust awareness: Fortnite has about 239 million active monthly users, according to ActivePlayer, and 80% of Americans have never visited a Holocaust museum, according to a 2018 study.

Fortnite players who visit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atA?mblid=f55d01a9915c&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Voices of The Forgotten Museum…

Can: Walk through exhibits resembling those found at in-person Holocaust museums, minus photos of dead bodies and concentration camps, which would violate the game’s age rating.

Cannot: Use weapons, break anything, or dance. Epic learned its lesson after players kept doing the floss and the robot at a 2021 in-game event <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atB?mblid=f1e6d0d6ad1b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.

Once the virtual museum opens (no release date yet), it could be a potent tool to deploy against a rise <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atC?mblid=4088a908872b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of white supremacy in online gaming spaces.

Key performance indicators <#> Still from Oppenheimer Universal Pictures
Stat: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has become the highest-grossing film set during World War II in history, passing Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan with a $500+ million global box-office haul, CNN reports. Of course, if you adjust for inflation, Oppenheimer is still behind the other two movies, but that’s less fun. Anyway, question for the audience: Ignoring box-office revenues…what’s the best movie set during WWII? Inglourious Basterds? Schindler’s List?

Many fellow baseball announcers voiced their support for Brown and bashed the Orioles organization, which until this PR debacle was having a stellar season (they’re in first place in the AL East). The Orioles denied that a suspension took place and said, “We look forward to hearing Kevin’s voice soon.”

This news is for anyone who has long ignored the little “Crypto” icon at the bottom of their Venmo screen. Yesterday, PayPal debuted its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), the first stablecoin to be issued by a global financial platform.

So…what is stablecoin? It’s a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, in this case the US dollar, which is meant to make it less volatile and safer than other tokens. Stablecoins have been around for decades but haven’t taken off in the consumer payment space—largely because regulators aren’t sold on that stability promise.

PayPal asserts that PYUSD will “reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments” and allow for faster and cheaper transfers between countries.

PYUSD works for peer-to-peer payments, both for checking out online or transferring value among digital wallets.

The currency is redeemable for dollars and is convertible to or from other digital currencies that PayPal supports.

And soon, you’ll be able to send your tokens between PayPal and Venmo, making it even more convenient to send Karl $50 for dinner and drinks.

The future of digital payments

Regulatory smackdowns have cast a shadow over crypto for the last year. PYUSD is issued by Paxos Trust Co., which previously issued the Binance stablecoin, BUSD, until that one was shut down by regulators earlier this year for…being involved with Binance.

But with PayPal—a mainstream fintech company—entering the scene, Paxos sees a “watershed moment” in stablecoin regulation coming. Congress is also currently sitting on two bills—one about the broader crypto industry and one that is specific to stablecoins—that could have a huge impact on what happens next.

What’s in it for PayPal? Besides keeping it at the cutting edge of payment tech, there’s a profit potential. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, could be on track to bring in $6 billion in revenue this year.—CC

That’s why their flagship robot, Flippy, is already automating frying stations for the biggest brands in fast food, including White Castle, Chipotle, Jack in the Box, and more.

An opportunity to invest in the company automating the $675b fast-food industry? That hits the spot.

Tesla’s CFO stepped down. Tesla’s chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn unexpectedly resigned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apS?mblid=f28b13750af7&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from his post after 13 years working with Elon Musk at the electric vehicle maker, which one asset manager told Bloomberg “is like working 50 years for anyone else.” Kirkhorn, who plans to stay at the company until the end of the year, to ensure a smooth transition has been replaced by the chief accounting officer. Still, the unexpected departure spooked investors, raising concerns about volatility in the company’s executive ranks and succession planning to one day replace Musk at the top.

Paramount found a new buyer for Simon & Schuster. Private equity firm KKR has agreed to buy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apJ?mblid=bfab53f7a28d&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the publisher for 1.62 billion. The deal comes less than a year after a federal judge kiboshed a plan to sell Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House for ~2.2 billion on antitrust grounds, ruling that deal would financially harm authors after a trial in which Stephen King testified against it. Rather than appeal, Paramount decided to search for a new buyer and received a $200 million fee from Random House since the deal failed to go through.

Yellow’s bankruptcy might cost taxpayers. The 99-year-old trucking company made it official on Sunday, filing for bankruptcy and ending the employment of its 30,000 workers following years of financial struggle and a labor battle with the Teamsters.

Freeway traffic won’t be the only thing grinding to a halt in Los Angeles today. More than 11,000 city workers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aps?mblid=982a23e4177f&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> plan to walk off the job this morning for 24 hours.

Sanitation and airport workers fed up with a lack of resources and unfilled vacancies will be among those participating, according to the SEIU Local 721, which represents many city workers.

This comes as Hot Strike Summer has been extra scorching in LA. The city workers will be joining:

170,000 Hollywood actors and 12,500 screenwriters picketing there and in NYC.

Thousands of local hotel workers staging rolling strikes, who even tried to get Taylor Swift to postpone LA tour dates.

Nationwide, strikes have spiked this summer, putting July among the busiest months for labor action in decades, according to the Washington Post.

There’s another big strike looming, though: With the auto workers union demanding a 40% raise for 150,000 hourly workers at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, Detroit may soon look like LA with less green juice.—AR

Turns out Classics majors and petroleum-engineering students have more in common than we thought: Their programs are shrinking. College students just aren’t interested in entering <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apy?mblid=b31f31d7b6cb&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the oil and gas industry like they used to be, no matter how much money they are set to make when they graduate, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The number of undergrads studying petroleum engineering—once a practical, popular major that would make Boomer parents proud—has seen a 75% decline since 2014, Texas Tech professor Lloyd Heinze told the WSJ.

In the past, enrollment in oil- and gas-related majors followed the market, but despite oil prices popping off between 2016 and 2021, the number grads entering the field still fell, according to the US Dept. of Education. It probably didn’t help that the pandemic highlighted how volatile the oil and gas industry could be as companies laid off over 100,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apz?mblid=1c47df17fa6d&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> employees between March and August 2020.

It’s not just about business. Post-graduation, petroleum engineers can earn 40% more than computer science grads, but Gen Z are opting for more environmentally conscious companies and roles. Current students are nervous about the fossil fuel industry’s role in climate change and if these high-paying jobs will even exist in the future as the country moves towards clean energy.—MM

Good morning. It boggles the mind of a Northeasterner who’s used to a post-Labor Day start, but apparently many kids across the US will return for the first day of school this morning.

Of course, they’ll have an earlier start to the summer than we did. So here’s a question: Would you rather be in school for most of August but out by Memorial Day? Or have August free but sit in class through June ?

SPORTS

What just happened to college football? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Oregon and Washington football players line up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tom Hauck/Getty Images
Over the past few days, college football has undergone a shake-up that further obliterated traditional geographic rivalries, left a once-proud conference on its deathbed, and cemented the formation of a handful of national superconferences—all in the pursuit of TV riches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alT?mblid=3193b1c779ba&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

The moves reflect the inevitable professionalization of college football, one of the only university athletic products that can command billions of dollars for television broadcast rights.

Here’s what went down:

Oregon and Washington defected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alU?mblid=97b1055b7978&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, joining their West Coast peers USC and UCLA in the once-Midwestern-focused conference that will soon have 18 teams from coast to coast.

Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah said they would also leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, a decision Colorado made two weeks ago.

The 108-year-old Pac-12 is teetering on the verge of collapse with just four schools remaining: Stanford, Cal, Oregon State, and Washington State.

If you hate this, blame TV

The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference (SEC) have recently secured mega TV deals that will pay their members handsomely…and the Pac-12 has not. It’s that simple.

The SEC inked a $3 billion deal for 10 years with Disney beginning in 2024, while the Big Ten reached a mammoth agreement with Fox, CBS, and NBC worth up to $7.5 billion over seven years. The Pac-12 has been trying to strike a deal with Apple TV+ to stream its games, but the potential payout for schools was not enough to stop the exodus.

The Big Ten sent $58 million to each of its schools during the 2021–22 fiscal year, according to tax records, and that number will only grow under its new TV deal.

Under the Apple deal, Pac-12 members would receive $30 million…on the high end of the range.

Big picture: “The old question—how long would it take TV money to destroy college football? Maybe we’re here. Maybe we’re here,” the head football coach at Washington State mused last Thursday. And whether or not you agree that conference realignment has “destroyed” college football, it has certainly dismantled the regional distinctiveness of each conference that gave the sport its magic.

The USWNT is going home from the World Cup.

Coming ahead of the quarterfinal round, it was the US women’s earliest exit from a World Cup ever. The next chance for some hardware isn’t far away—the Paris Olympics are next summer—but the once-dominant USWNT has found that its international peers are catching up to its quality.

Barbie is also the fastest-selling movie in the 100-year history of Warner Bros., reaching 10 figures after just 17 days in theaters. And the momentum isn’t slowing down: Barbie held its spot as the No. 1 movie in North America for the third straight weekend.

RIP fully remote work: 2020–2023. You lived a beautiful life that left an imprint on couches everywhere.

The cause of death? Videoconferencing software company Zoom has told employees within a 50-mile radius of one of its offices that they must come in <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am1?mblid=48b26b51f92d&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at least two days a week, Insider reported.

Zoom, of course, was the poster child for remote work during the pandemic, emerging from obscurity to become the go-to video platform for work meetings and awkward virtual happy hours. So, I don’t need to explain the symbolism of Zoom telling its employees to return to the physical office to describe how CEOs think fully remote work is going for them.

The increased hostility toward WFH from executives certainly hasn’t been good for Zoom stock. After soaring more than 6x during the pandemic, Zoom has lost more than $100 billion in market value since its peak, per Insider.

Google’s trying a different strategy to lure workers back

A cheap hotel stay. The tech giant is offering its employees a sweetheart deal to check in to the Google-owned hotel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am2?mblid=0f2f70059378&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on its Mountain View campus for $99 a night, CNBC reported, hoping that a breezy commute will attract more Googlers to code in person.

This “Summer Special” does not fall under approved business travel, so the hotel stays will come out of employees’ pockets. Still, workers have been doing the math…and $99/night comes out to about $3,000/month, which is less than many of them pay for rent in Silicon Valley. Plus, someone makes your bed.

Key performance indicators <#> Chart showing how much people pay for their cars per month across the US Edmunds
Stat: Last quarter, in truck-lovin’ states Texas and Wyoming, more than 25% of car shoppers committed to a payment of more than $1,000 per month <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am7?mblid=cac1b253d88b&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to Edmunds. Across the country, the share of car buyers who financed a vehicle with a monthly payment of at least $1,000 jumped to a record 17.1% in Q2 (in 2019, it was just 4.3%). Higher auto prices and borrowing rates are making buying a vehicle a major expense for households.

**Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends August 31, 2023.

We all know the barriers to investing in real estate. It’s confusing. It’s expensive. It’s one-sided. It’s only available to folks who have an extra mil laying around—right?

Wrong. Roots is dropping a remix on these tired old stereotypes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/akS?lp=text1&mbadid=6d7af96ec0ee51ff6038135139148468&mbadv=a&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Now you can invest in real estate to build your wealth for as little as $100 while lifting up the renters in the communities.

Want the deets? Invest in the Roots fund <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/akS?lp=text2&mbadid=6d7af96ec0ee51ff6038135139148468&mbadv=a&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Roots buys properties and finds top-notch renters. Those renters get invested into the fund from day one and get rewarded for paying rent on time and taking care of the property, leading to fewer vacancies, lower turn costs, and better returns.

It’s the ultimate win-win, and the fund has seen 36% growth in the last 2 years. Join over 1k investors and invest in as little as 5 minutes.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even pop some bubbly.

Scientists climb cathedrals to collect space dust. Old churches preserve more than just architectural history: Their spired roofs are an untouched oasis of asteroid and comet particles, and two scientists are going, as The Guardian put it, Ghostbusters-mode to gather samples. Equipped with harnesses and vacuum backpacks, Penny Wozniakiewicz and Matthias van Ginneken plan to scale cathedrals across the UK to gather the cosmic dust lying atop. They’re trying to understand how heavily the space objects that melt into particles en route to Earth layer our surfaces. They say cathedrals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajS?mblid=24e58d4ca294&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> are especially useful because they tend to have good construction records showing how long the roofs have been there, collecting dust.

Are you very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy? That’s the question that the General Social Survey has asked a sample of US adults since 1972. A new analysis of people’s answers shows we’re all doing…okay. There’s been a dip in happiness <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajT?mblid=79d886c45a4c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since about the turn of the century, but satisfaction has started to turn around. However, not everyone is equally happy: Married people tend to be 30% happier than unmarried folks, people who trust others (or the government) are happier than people who sleep with one eye open, and the Northeast is the unhappiest region. And women, but not men, have reported declining happiness for the past 50 years.

Size matters for keeping champagne fizzy. A 3-liter bottle of bubbly is predicted to last for 132 years before going flat—more than three times the shelf life of a 750-milliliter champagne bottle, according to a new study. A French physicist studying champagne <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajU?mblid=687012d36d13&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne analyzed the aging process of 13 vintage collections. He and his team found that after champagne’s necessary aging period, all the bottles lost carbonation the longer they sat on the shelf, but the larger the bottles were, the more fizz they retained. So, the next time you buy old champagne, the research suggests you should spring for a jeroboam.—ML

Meanwhile, social media has been abuzz as hobbyists try to synthesize the so-called “LK-99” substance at home and publish their DIY experiments online.

Why are normies suddenly obsessed with solid-state physics?

Existing superconductors are impractical for most real-world uses since they can only function at super-low temperatures or under extremely high pressure. Finding one that works in ambient-pressure, room-temp conditions is a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement that would be as game-changing as TV headphones were for your grandparents’ marriage.

Because superconductors can boost any tech that relies on electricity or magnets, a commercially viable one could enable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajW?mblid=00eb73aa34ac&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> futuristic developments like ubiquitous floating maglev trains, 100% energy-efficient grids, and commercially viable quantum computers.

That’s why everyone’s so hyped over the Seoul-based scientists’ two preliminary papers and video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajX?mblid=ed7c6199e102&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the ostensibly floating substance, LK-99. It’s already started to affect markets in Asia and the US, briefly rallying stocks of obscure companies that could benefit from a superconductor revolution. But, before the scientific community breaks into a Windows 95-launch nerd dance <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajY?mblid=4825f474d7ab&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, other experts have to review the methods and data in the paper and replicate the experiment to ensure it’s not a fluke.

The race to replicate is on

At least 12 academic labs on four continents are publicly working to synthesize the supposedly superconductive material, according to one blogger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajZ?mblid=1aeb105c158c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> who’s been tracking the progress.

US-based Lawrence Berkeley National Lab <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj-?mblid=d21626a71834&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and China’s Shenyang National Laboratory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj_?mblid=1e34449d75d3&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, as well as other labs, published tentative findings indicating that there’s a chance that the substance is indeed a superconductor.

And since the original experiment involved a mix of easy-to-procure ingredients and pretty straightforward techniques, DIYers are also getting in on the act and making LK-99 the internet’s main character.

She claims concocting the superconducting substance using her modified method cost her around $160.

* An engineer working at a California space startup, Andrew McCalip, has been spending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak2?mblid=9ddb2780b651&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a lot of time trying to cook up the floating metal and tweeting his progress.

* Levitating LK-99 became a side project for French chemistry PhD student Ezzoubair Bendadesse who (according to his unverified X account) so far has failed twice but managed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak3?mblid=7f088a60832d&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to produce a “reddish pellet.”

But most physicists are casting doubt on LK-99

Despite the internet’s enthusiasm, skepticism has been the prevailing sentiment among most experts. Material scientists are well aware that erroneous superconductor “breakthroughs” have happened before. There’s even a term for such “discoveries”: USOs (unidentified superconducting objects). 

A committee organized by the Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics said the researchers from Seoul did not provide enough evidence to conclude that the substance is really a room-temperature superconductor. They asked to review a sample of the substance.

Argonne National Laboratory theorist Michael Norman has questioned the expertise of the same researchers. He told Science Magazine that parts of their data seem “fishy” and that he’s doubtful about how exactly LK-99 can work, pointing out that superconducting is puzzlingly uncharacteristic of some of the ingredients in the metal alloy.

Looking ahead...we’ll have to wait and see whether LK-99 can be verified, but some think the fact that this saga is playing out so publicly is already a win for the scientific method. Maybe the real ambient superconductor is the lab partners we made along the way.—SK

Welcome to Residuals Tavern, where a $0.50 check will get you a beer on the house.

As its name suggests, this Studio City bar is a reference to the royalty checks known as “residuals” Hollywood performers receive when the shows or movies they worked on get optioned for reruns. In the boom years of the ’90s, residual checks could run into the hundreds of dollars. But in the streaming era, many payouts have shrunk to less than $1—a central reason why actors and writers have gone on strike.

The plastic container brand revealed back in April that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the stock still smelled fresh to day traders who sniff out the market’s leftovers. And the traders’ strategy is starting to look more airtight after shares reached a nine-month high yesterday following Tupperware’s announcement of a deal with lenders to restructure its debt and secure $21 million in new financing.

After a pandemic-era boom in sales ended, the 77-year-old enabler of we-have-food-at-home families stumbled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al8?mblid=80ee4320b57f&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and Tupperware Brands was warned in June that the NYSE might delist it because of its low value and sub-$1 stock price.

But last month, penny stock savants started snapping up the company’s shares, and BlackRock  also stepped in to catch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al9?mblid=647faa95bad9&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the falling containers as an investment partner. Tupperware’s stock has since soared to around $5—still low, but offering meteoric returns for people who bought in last month at its 61-cent low.

But Tupperware might be more than a meme stock. Some analysts say <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ala?mblid=e6f842eef522&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the container company’s rebound looks less like the internet-fueled spike in AMC and GameStop’s stocks, and more like another risky recent phenomenon: a bankrupt stock buy-up.

Notable examples include…

Transportation company Yellow Corp., which shut down operations last weekend…and then saw its stock soar by roughly 350% between Monday and Friday amid reports of a bankruptcy loan.

Hertz, the rental car company that enjoyed a 900% stock rally in the two weeks following its 2020 bankruptcy filing. It emerged from bankruptcy with a deal that paid off its debts and paid out to stockholders.

Early days: For Tupperware to mount a full comeback, it would have to confront the reason its stock (and its sales) started sliding in the first place: competitors like Pyrex and Rubbermaid.—ML

Pill for postpartum depression approved. Yesterday, the FDA signed off on the first pill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alJ?mblid=706abf2f5ccb&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for postpartum depression, a condition that affects one in eight mothers after giving birth. Sage Therapeutics and Biogen plan to start selling the pill in the US under the brand name Zurzuvae by the end of the year, after the Drug Enforcement Administration completes its review. Sage already has a postpartum depression treatment on the market, but it’s an infusion given continuously over two days, making it much less convenient for parents wrangling newborns than the new pill, which should be taken daily for two weeks.

Carl Icahn suffers on the other side of the activist equation.

A trial on the remaining claims in the high-profile case is scheduled to begin on September 12. The government hasn’t had much luck lately enforcing antitrust claims against Big Tech, but the case still poses a potential threat to Google’s core business.

Bots are usually the last thing you want to encounter on a dating app while swiping through endless photos of people standing atop mountains, but Tinder is preparing to harness the power of AI <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alf?mblid=445c83de380d&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the good of your profile.

The app, which already uses artificial intelligence in its matching algorithms, has started testing new customer-facing tools. One sifts through your photos and selects the best five to display (hopefully with the good sense to avoid the ambiguous group shot), addressing a pain point where many users get flustered in building their profile.

It’s just the beginning of the AI dating revolution. Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, which also owns Hinge and OKCupid, revealed plans in its recent earnings announcement to integrate new AI features across its brands, not just to help build profiles but also to highlight why someone may be a good match.

And the company can’t control whether daters bring AI into the mix themselves: A recent UK study found that over 50% of single men would use chatbots to help chat up potential dates.

Lo-fi alternatives: As dating apps go increasingly high-tech, some singles are turning to more staid Google Docs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alg?mblid=b91e7c64be72&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and creating long form “date-me docs” to find romance outside the app grind.—AR

TRAVEL

Airlines are dropping prices to keep you in the US <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of Earth with lots of planes crisscrossing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Travel within the US is down this summer, and airlines are slashing prices in the hopes that a $60 ticket will be cheap enough to convince you to visit Cleveland.

Earlier this week, US-focused JetBlue cut its earnings forecast for the year and warned of a loss in Q3. Other primarily domestic airlines are also experiencing turbulence:

Alaska Airlines has slashed fares, while Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier held flight promotions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahg?mblid=687a4940feaa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this summer—a sign of struggle within the industry.

US round-trip fares are down 11% compared to 2022 and 2019, according to Hopper.com.

Meanwhile…American Airlines, Delta, and United—all carriers with global operations—have exceeded expectations and kept prices high. International airfare is averaging $962, up 10% from last year and 26% from 2019, per Hopper.

Bucket list trips > sand bucket trips

Why are people traveling outside the US? It’s not exactly a mystery: Americans who were stuck in the country for nearly two years are ready to put their Duolingo streak to the ultimate test. Mastercard said that spending linked to overseas travel is currently at 154% of pre-pandemic levels.

So…where is everyone?

Predictably, a lot of Americans are in Europe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahh?mblid=bbb5d5328e0b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. According to Allianz, the number of Americans traveling to Europe this year will be 55% more than last summer, with London, Paris, Dublin, and Rome as the top destinations.

Travel to Pacific countries, including China and Japan, has also popped off. American Airlines said passenger revenue for trans-Pacific routes has more than tripled in the first half of the year.

All the international travel has left American attractions feeling a little empty inside. Major theme parks, including Disney World, Universal, Six Flags, and SeaWorld, have all reported lower-than-usual attendance rates this summer.—CC

As he’s responded to his previous two indictments, Trump pleaded not guilty. The next date to circle on your calendar for this case is August 28 for a hearing, which is just five days after the first Republican presidential debate (it’s possible Trump will not attend either). At the hearing, the judge will likely set a trial date.

But the hangover might be easing up. The company said that Bud Light’s market share has stabilized (albeit at a lower level) and hopes its new beer-and-sunshine marketing campaign will win back customers.

Start preparing for an onslaught of gas-pump pics on social media with the caption, “Thanks, Biden!” The national average of gas rose to a nine-month high of $3.82 per gallon yesterday, up 11 cents from a week ago, per AAA.

So, what’s driving prices higher? A noxious mix of heat and geopolitics.

The heat: It was so hot in July that refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, which aren’t designed for temps over 95 degrees, are struggling to produce gasoline. That, paired with increased demand for fuel over the summer (so many late-night drives blaring Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive”), means gasoline inventories in the country have fallen to their lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahq?mblid=93cdaafb1b30&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> July level since 2015.

The geopolitics: Major oil producer Saudi Arabia said yesterday it would extend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahr?mblid=a1c22288183b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its output cuts into September and could even deepen those cuts after that, according to state media. By curbing supply, Saudi Arabia hopes to prop up the price of oil—which gives it critical revenue to spend on futuristic cities and Ronaldo’s teammates. But the cuts are angering the White House because they could lead to an uptick in US inflation.

Looking ahead...the rise in gas prices may not last. Refinery operations are returning <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahs?mblid=9359c24e54aa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to normal, and demand usually tapers off in August, according to an AAA spokesperson.

Lizzo’s dance captain pushed religious beliefs on the other dancers and publicly fixated on one plaintiff’s abstinence.

Members of the dance cast, described as “full-figured women of color” in the suit, were scolded when they asked for better compensation for tour downtime.

An “excruciating” rehearsal left one plaintiff so fearful of being let go for underperforming that she soiled herself rather than take a bathroom break. She says she was later fired for recording a meeting, and that Lizzo’s security team didn’t let her leave until they searched her phone for the video.

Since the lawsuit was announced, three more women who used to work with Lizzo have said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahx?mblid=ab700f8200bd&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> they had similar experiences with the singer…but Lizzo maintains the allegations are just “sensationalized stories.”—ML

Stat: Ugh, the CEOs ordering you to return to the office just got some fresh backup from science. A new working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that data entry employees in Chennai, India, randomly assigned to work from home were 18% less productive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahB?mblid=7e11a01fe132&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> than employees who worked at the office. And that gap gets even wider (27%) when measuring the reduced productivity of workers who prefer to work from home. But maybe that’s the point. After all, recent trends <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahC?mblid=72bcc533985c&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> like “quiet quitting” and having a “lazy-girl job” show that people want to work less, at home.

By now, we’re all about as desensitized to recession talk as to the prophecies of a doomsday cult. And we may be right: Yesterday, Bank of America’s economists became the first at a major Wall Street Bank to reverse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adP?mblid=9f5551f4d0d1&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their earlier prediction, saying there won’t be a recession in the next year.

Less than a year ago, just about everyone was forecasting an imminent recession. The Bloomberg Economics probability model suggested there was a 100% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EX?mblid=6e14c297563a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> chance the US would be plunged into a recession in the next year. And back in June 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adQ?mblid=65d662588b14&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> investors to brace for an impending economic “hurricane.”

BofA pointed to solid consumer spending and inflation cooling to 3% last month. And its economists noted that, despite the Fed’s string of interest rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong with unemployment rates staying low (just 3.6% in June) and companies slowly hiring.

It’s not just BofA seeing clear skies ahead

Even as it raised interest rates again last week, the Federal Reserve said that it’s expecting a recession-free 2023. And Goldman Sachs cut the odds of recession in the next year from 25% to 20%.

CEOs in Q2 earnings calls were also feeling hopeful. The phrase “soft landing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adR?mblid=d71572ab5e1a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” the term for the Fed managing totackle inflation without tanking the economy, has been mentioned during earnings calls 97% more this cycle than in the last one.

Execs’ comments ranged from PNC CEO Bill Demchak’s “I think the soft landing feels right” to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s “I don’t know what the hell was going on.”

Even JPMorgan’s Dimon refrained from natural disaster metaphors and instead said the US consumer was currently in good shape.

Not everyone feels the same. The rosier predictions have made the timing of ratings agency Fitch’s decision to downgrade the US’ credit rating this week over political polarization awkward (Dimon called it ridiculous). But the New York Times pointed out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adS?mblid=76cc8344d88c&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that economists also made high-profile soft landing predictions right before recessions in 1990, 2000, and 2008.—MM

Tree of Life Synagogue Shooter sentenced to death. Yesterday, a federal jury concluded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aek?mblid=614f8c8bb250&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Robert Bowers, who killed 11 people at the Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath morning services, should be given the death penalty. The 2018 shooting was the deadliest antisemitic attack ever perpetrated in the US. The same jury in May convicted Bowers of 63 criminal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. A judge will formally hand down the sentence today.

Warner Brothers apologized for Barbenheimer posts. The internet is so obsessed with mashing up the two big movies of summer that it helped boost ticket sales for both Barbie and Oppenheimer, but there’s one place people are not amused: Japan. After US social media accounts for Warner Brothers’ doll movie acknowledged the memes, Japanese social media users expressed their displeasure with seeing the national tragedy of the atomic bomb as part of a joke, and the company’s Japanese arm called on its US parent to take action. In response, the US company issued an apology <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ael?mblid=a18ef3b81b09&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and deleted its posts.

Amazon has begun the largest overhaul of its grocery business since planting a flag in a Whole Foods papaya six years ago.

The revamp comes after the tech giant has struggled to work its usual industry-reinventing magic on grocery sales.

Now, under the guidance of former Whole Foods and Tesco executives, the online purveyor of every product ever is launching new strategies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adX?mblid=0c0d5f5670cd&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to beef up its in-person stores and grow its share of the $1.5 trillion US grocery market, which is dominated by Walmart and Kroger. The big changes:

Amazon Fresh delivery is now available to non-Prime members in a dozen cities, with plans to expand nationwide by year’s end.

To make Amazon Fresh stores feel more…human…the redesigned supermarkets will feature brighter colors, Krispy Kreme stands by the front door, and self-checkout lanes to supplement its E-ZPass-esque “Just Walk Out” system.

Online, the shopping carts for Amazon Fresh, Amazon.com, and Whole Foods will merge into one, eliminating the need for separate checkouts.

Yesterday, the Jamaican women’s national team danced to “One Love” to celebrate what seemed an unlikely achievement just months ago: drawing with Brazil to advance to the knockout stage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adF?mblid=3f2792ae2c22&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the World Cup.

Throw it back to April: To get the resources they needed to make it to the tournament, the self-styled Reggae Girlz were forced to throw it to the fans with crowdfunding campaigns.

In an Instagram post <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adG?mblid=29bc9f036238&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, players complained that the Jamaica Football Federation, which was struggling to find funding to send them to the World Cup, was providing “subpar planning, transportation, accommodations, training conditions,” and more. But the lack of support from the JFF led to a flood of support from elsewhere: A pair of crowdfunding campaigns has collectively raised over $100,000 for travel expenses, training, and the team’s staff.

One notable supporter is Cedella Marley—Bob Marley’s daughter—who has helped to keep the team afloat in the past after it was disbanded by JFF for…lack of funding.

It could be because the lake was built over an old burial ground—it was cheaper to fill the manmade lake on top of the roads, homes, and, yes, cemeteries in the area than to demolish them first, according to Oxford American.

Good morning. Former President Trump was indicted yesterday on federal charges over his efforts to subvert American democracy and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. It’s the third indictment brought against Trump, who now faces a total of 78 criminal counts and a $40+ million (and growing) legal bill.

Trump said he was innocent and has vowed to continue his campaign to retake the White House. On Monday, a New York Times/Siena College poll found that he was demolishing the field for the Republican nomination, leading second-place Ron DeSantis 54% to 17%.

A story about a former federal agent on a mission to save a child from sex traffickers in the Colombia jungle has made more money at the box office than Tom Cruise battling an omnipotent AI superbeing.

With an estimated budget of $14.6 million and zero A-list talent, Sound of Freedom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aao?mblid=739cfa54a0dd&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has raked in over $149 million in the US and Canada since its July Fourth premiere, putting it ahead of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and not far behind the latest Indiana Jones movie. And the two Hollywood heavy hitters had budgets of $291 million and $294.7 million, respectively. 

Why the resounding success?

An unconventional marketing strategy is fueling sales: The lead actor, Jim Caviezel, appears on screen after the movie ends and urges viewers to “pay it forward” by buying tickets for others. More than 20% of opening-day tickets were purchased in response to this method, bringing in $2.6 million. A decent critical reception <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aap?mblid=7fea97c9713b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> also helped (though some experts have criticized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaq?mblid=54f32a09f70b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the film for misrepresenting aspects of real-life human trafficking).

But, perhaps even more importantly, Sound of Freedom’s focus on children’s issues and its Christian themes have made it particularly popular among conservatives.

Former President Trump screened it for political allies at his private club in New Jersey, and GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy held a viewing event for a group of lawmakers.

It’s also reportedly been embraced by QAnon conspiracy theorists who believe that liberal elites are running a child sex trafficking ring.

The film itself has become a subject of conspiracy theories. Some viewers have claimed that theaters sabotaged screenings through nefarious tactics like withholding A/C. AMC Theaters CEO Adam Aron called allegations that the chain is suppressing viewership for Sound of Freedom “bizarre,” pointing out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aar?mblid=5fa42fff97b1&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the movie is available at 570 of its locations.—SK

The last time the US received a credit downgrade was in 2011, when S&P sent it to AA+, causing market mayhem. Past and present US economic officials said Fitch was off its rocker for the decision. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called it “bizarre and inept” given the current strength of the US economy.

The family of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells underpin much of modern medicine, reached a settlement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaz?mblid=e19444b6ba5c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday with biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Lacks’s descendants filed a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaA?mblid=c8ca21421f47&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against Thermo Fisher in 2021, claiming that the company profited off of Lacks’s cells for decades by selling her cells and seeking to obtain IP rights to medical advancements that they were used to develop.

It’s a remarkable, and painful, story. Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. While receiving treatment at Johns Hopkins, Lacks’s cells were harvested without her knowledge or consent. When researchers observed her cells in the lab, they found something surprising: They multiplied, whereas others would die within days. Scientists dubbed the line of identical cells “HeLa,” after Lacks’s name, and have used it for a variety <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaB?mblid=fea7f06a7c43&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of medical advancements you’ve likely benefited from. According to the World Health Organization, HeLa cells were used:

In developing vaccines for polio, HPV, the flu, and Covid-19.

To study different types of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as IVF.

Zoom out: The settlement terms are confidential, but Lacks’s family has used the lawsuit to call attention to racism in the American medical system, saying in their complaint, “Too often, the history of medical experimentation in the United States has been the history of medical racism.”

Bed Bath & Beyond, which filed for bankruptcy in April, came back online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaH?mblid=fac5611d3431&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday after its buyer, Overstock.com, pulled a Kirby and rebranded itself as…Bed Bath & Beyond.

The backstory: In June, Overstock picked through BB&B’s carcass and bought its name, some of its assets, and its long list of customer info for $21.5 million—but not any of its physical locations. Overstock, a former online liquidator, was hunting for a rebrand to market itself differently to customers, so it’s hoping that slapping the iconic BB&B name on its site and products will set it up for success.

But sometimes, a recognizable name is not enough. Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), a company created by sentient LinkedIn post Tai Lopez and Zoosk founder Alex Mehr, has also tried to resurrect collapsed brick-and-mortar brands. They’ve spent about $120 million since 2019 acquiring defunct retailers and attempting to bring them back to life online.

It’s gone…not well. REV has let its websites for brands like Linens ‘N Things and Modell’s fall into disrepair with sparse (if any) product listings. It even tried (and failed) to flip RadioShack into a crypto exchange in 2021. The WSJ reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaI?mblid=68f6b90e657c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in March that the group was looking into “restructuring options,” while REV acknowledged it would pause debt payments.

Overstock Bed Bath & Beyond will try to avoid the same mistakes. It’s planning to revive the customer loyalty its namesake once had and aims to release a wedding registry by next summer.—MM

Key performance indicators <#> Illustration showing Miami's population decreasing Francis Scialabba
Stat: Here are two stats that might challenge how you thought the US population was shifting.

Miami is shrinking. On net, Miami-Dade County lost nearly 80,000 people <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaM?mblid=f6e5e32fb379&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> between 2020 and 2022, per Census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution. Higher housing costs, an inconsistent job market, and perhaps overflowing septic tanks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaN?mblid=5320eced2c97&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> drove people away from a city that had hyped itself as the future of finance and crypto. Maybe Messi can turn things around.

California is gaining rich people. Millionaires love to complain about California’s high taxes, but the pull of wearing sweaters at the beach remains too strong <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaO?mblid=4b00189bb103&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The state added 116,000+ millionaire taxpayers from the end of 2019 through 2021, more than in the previous decade combined, per CA’s Department of Finance.

Quote: “Inedible.”

That’s how MrBeast described MrBeast Burger in a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaP?mblid=d7c748cb1d83&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the YouTuber filed against his partner in the venture, Virtual Dining Concepts. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, claimed the company prioritized expansion over quality control, causing “material, irreparable harm” to his brand and reputation. MrBeast Burger became a ghost-kitchen phenomenon during the pandemic, selling 1 million burgers in its first three months. But eventually, people realized that the burgers were…horrible. In the suit, Donaldson cited customer complaints that the patties were “revolting” and “disgusting.”

President Biden hopes it will give relief to the federal borrowers impacted when the Supreme Court struck down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91V?mblid=e60a8431d071&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> his more ambitious student loan forgiveness program in June.

Beginning this fall under the SAVE Plan…

One million more Americans will qualify for $0 monthly payments, the Department of Education estimates. The SAVE Plan raises the income threshold for paying nothing to $32,805, up from $22,000 or less under current income-driven repayment programs.

Unpaid interest will not pile up as long as people make their monthly payments, even if that monthly payment gets cut to $0.

And, beginning in July 2024…

Loans of $12,000 or less will be canceled after 10 years of payments (including loans taken out before 2024). Every additional $1,000 that’s borrowed beyond that would extend cancellation by another year, so a $22,000 loan would get canceled after 20 years of payments.

Undergraduate loan payments will be capped at 5% of borrowers’ discretionary funds—total income minus $32,800—down from 10% under current programs.

A net 51% of banks said they’d raised their standards for large- and medium-sized business loans last, up from 46% during Q1 and the highest since 2008 (not counting the pandemic). For consumer loans, more banks than last quarter said they had upped credit card loan standards, but not as many banks tightened auto loan standards. Banks expect standards to keep getting tighter, with most reporting they’ll continue to make them tougher across loan categories.

Homer Simpson’s expertise is wanted down South: Georgia’s Plant Vogtle has taken a brand-new reactor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7n?mblid=351eec0eee4f&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> online, the company that operates it announced yesterday.

The first built-from-scratch nuclear reactor to launch in the US in decades is supplying electricity to Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, with the capacity to power up to 500,000 homes and businesses.

The new reactor is part of a larger expansion at Vogtle, which already had two operational reactors and will add a fourth one by next spring if everything goes according to plan. But, so far, things haven’t: The new reactor went live seven years later than planned, and costs ballooned from $14 billion to nearly $35 billion.

The delays and cost overruns have led some experts to oppose new nuclear plant construction as impractical, but the public is warming up to the energy source. Recent polls show <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7o?mblid=60670cb84e41&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the highest level of support for nuclear power in a decade. It currently supplies almost 50% of US carbon-free electricity, and many experts believe it’s an important clean energy supplement to wind and solar.

What would you pay for a Birken stock? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Birkenstock sandal in display window. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> John MacDougall/Getty Images
Wearing the chunkiest, ugliest shoes has always been in fashion for some of us. But now it’s clog girl summer and Birkenstock is bracing for a possible September IPO that would value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7i?mblid=418a1f4a002e&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the company anywhere from $8 billion to $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Birks have always been lurking. The German sandal has enjoyed several waves of popularity since it first arrived in the US in the ’60s. The shoe had a moment in the ’90s and 2000s, when mega celebrities wore them. And just like other perfectly horrendous footwear (Crocs just reported a record $1 billion of revenue for the second quarter and is valued at ~$6.7 billion), Birks are back.

Birkenstock’s revenue jumped about 29% to $1.3 billion last year.

They’re not just for Dead Heads anymore: Celebs like Kendall Jenner are rocking the sandal, and Birks even made it in a couple scenes of the new Barbie movie, which helped boost recent sales, according to Bloomberg.

Two years ago, Birkenstock was acquired in a deal that valued the company at roughly $4.9 billion by L. Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that keeps Bernard Arnault constantly trading spots with Elon Musk on the list of richest people in the world. Since the acquisition, the shoe has collabed with high-end designers like Dior and Manolo Blahnik.

Looking ahead...sources told Bloomberg that the timing and size of the IPO hasn’t been nailed down yet, but the potential plans are another sign that market debuts are making their own comeback.—MM

The “Luna,” created by scientists at the University of California, Riverside, could represent major avocado innovation because it grows on a smaller tree and can be more efficiently harvested than the popular Hass variety (Luna’s great-grandmother).

OK—but how’s it taste? It’s got a different flavor than the Hass we’re used to, Luna’s co-inventor told Axios, “but it makes a wonderful bowl of guacamole.” Sold.

Do Facebook’s and Instagram’s algorithms create echo chambers that widen political divisions and erode democracy in America?

Ask 100 people and 95 might say, “Yeah, that seems logical.” The idea that social media platforms are largely responsible for political polarization has been accepted as a proven fact by elected officials, regulators, and anyone who’s been tagged in a “Denver Airport is the HQ of the Illuminati” post by their uncle. Big Tech critic Scott Galloway, an NYU professor, declared <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a48?mblid=1fcf4c990234&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2019 that Facebook “intentionally drives our society apart” by “deepening users’ beliefs & magnifying outrage.”

But landmark new research complicates that narrative <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a49?mblid=9b3274599f44&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Four studies released last Thursday found that while echo chambers do exist on social media, they don’t drive political polarization in the way Facebook’s critics have described.

Here’s why

Researchers arrived at this conclusion by tweaking the content US Facebook users saw from September to December 2020 and measuring their behaviors during and after the experiment.

In one study, the researchers swapped out an algorithmic feed for a reverse chronological feed for tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users, which meant changing the type of posts from what the company wanted users to see to a stream of posts the company did not put its thumb on.

The changes had no impact on political polarization, and even led users to see more untrustworthy content. Another side effect: The chronological feed also made people bored and, consequently, spend less time on the platform.

How the researchers summed it up: “These findings challenge popular narratives blaming social media echo chambers for the problems of contemporary American democracy.”

Looking ahead...independent experts caution against drawing broad conclusions from these studies, which examined behavior during just a few months. But more clarity could come soon since at least 12 more peer-reviewed papers on the topic are on the way.

This research is also not without controversy, because Meta (the object of inquiry) was a key collaborator by providing the data. The company and the researchers are already butting heads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4a?mblid=b2b565917f12&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> around how to interpret the findings.

The company has been teetering on the brink for years due to botched acquisitions and labor strife with the Teamsters, and not even a $700 million loan from the Trump administration during Covid could save its finances from circling the drain. Yellow employs almost 30,000 people.

A military takeover of the West African country of Niger last week has created a belt of six African countries <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4f?mblid=72df4123565b&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> coast to coast where military juntas are now in charge of the government, the NYT reported. The 3,500-mile stretch is the longest such chain on Earth.

The impacts are global: This band of military-led countries encompasses a region known as the Sahel that has leapfrogged South Asia and the Middle East as the “global epicenter of jihadist violence,” per the Times. And as a hotbed of instability and insurgency, the area has been the site of geopolitical strategery by the West and Russia for influence.

The US spent $110 million on a drone base in northern Niger for counterterrorism operations in the Sahel.

Russia, meanwhile, exerts its pull in the area through Wagner mercenaries and their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin (who is no stranger to coups). Supporters of Niger’s military takeover were seen waving Russian flags <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4g?mblid=f251bc387fd8&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and chanting Vladimir Putin’s name yesterday.

  SCIENCE

Cash is still king when treating yourself. People are more likely to reach for dollar bills than credit cards when making a guilty pleasure purchase, according to new Stanford research. In more than 118,000 real transactions at the university bookstore, buyers tended to slap their plastic on the counter for school supplies but pay with cash for “harder-to-justify” items like a stuffed plush mascot. And when asked how they’d pay for a hypothetical reiki session, participants leaned toward credit card when the treatment was described as doctor-recommended but toward cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-S?mblid=332c9fadd0e8&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when they were told it was just an impulse purchase.

You don’t have to go full vegan to help the planet. If you’re caught between the rock of loving meat and the hard place of loving the environment, good news: You can make a big impact just by eating fewer burgers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-T?mblid=4f6e8a99e3f2&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Cutting your daily meat intake from more than 3.5 ounces to less than 1.8 ounces reduces your dietary environmental impact by 30%, according to new Oxford research. Veganism remains the most sustainable choice, with about a 70% lower overall effect on factors like pollution, biodiversity, and land and water usage—but any plant-based meal helps. Plus, a separate study found that eating more fruits and veggies reduces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-U?mblid=7f36d98263c1&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the risks of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression.

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Bidenomics: What is it and is it working? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-W?mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> President Biden at an auto plant <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-W?mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Nic Antaya/Getty Images If Larry David were a macroeconomist, he’d probably tell you that the economy is doing pretty, pretty, pretty good. The real economists at Morgan Stanley have upgraded their prediction for this year’s US GDP growth by almost fourfold (to 1.9%), crediting the boost to wonkland’s new favorite buzzword: “Bidenomics.”

Biden’s critics and supporters alike have embraced the term for the president’s economic philosophy. And now that POTUS has made it central to his reelection campaign, you’re going to keep hearing it.

What does it mean? The backbone of Bidenomics is industrial policy, aka directing loads of government spending toward key industries like clean energy and semiconductor production. The goal is to make America a high-tech manufacturing hub that’s less reliant on global supply chains while creating solid middle-class jobs.

It’s intended as a rejoinder to Reaganomics, the philosophy that reducing business regulations and cutting taxes for the rich juices spending, making wealth eventually trickle down through the economy.

But in Bidenomics, it’s federal spending that drives the action.

* The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made $550 billion available for road repairs, broadband expansion, and electrical grid upgrades. 

* Chipmakers now have more reason to chipmake in the US thanks to $52.7 billion in direct subsidies in the CHIPS and Science Act.

* And companies involved in solar, wind, and clean hydrogen technologies can receive tax breaks and funding from the $500 billion Inflation Reduction Act.

The administration also doled out cash for social welfare, like temporarily expanding a tax rebate for families with children in 2021.

How’s it going so far?

The White House has quickly branded recent strong economic data as a Bidenomics win. Experts were surprised by faster-than-expected 2.4% annualized GDP growth last quarter, partially due to government spending. Yearly inflation cooled to 3% last month after peaking at 9.1% a year prior, and the labor market remains strong.

Just how much credit Biden’s industrial push deserves for all that is up for debate. But there are some concrete industry investments stemming from the new laws:

* Lured by federal subsidies, chipmakers plan to invest $210 billion in US factories and employ 44,000 people, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

* And many foreign cleantech companies are reportedly looking to invest in the US, where incentives for their industry abound. Swiss solar battery-maker Meyer Burger indefinitely postponed plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-X?mblid=aa2c066b180a&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to expand in Germany and wants to build a factory in Colorado Springs, CO, where it says it will hire 350 people.

Cheerful economic updates don’t automatically turn workers into Biden supporters though—only 36% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the economy, per <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-Y?mblid=dae847996450&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> recent polling.

Many people are still spooked by months of predictions that a recession is near and feel like inflation has eaten into wage gains, Robert D. Atkinson, economist and founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told Morning Brew.

It’s complicated…

Not all experts love the idea of the government tipping the scale in favor of some industries.

And even fans of these measures worry about the implementation. Atkins, for example, wishes Biden could have bolstered US manufacturing more broadly, focusing on aerospace and pharmaceuticals, too.

Other critics think that the strings the administration attached <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-Z?mblid=344e9e03c720&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to industry-boosting incentives, like requirements to provide certain worker benefits, distract from their main purpose of building high-tech products with a “Made in USA” sticker. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal’s Chief Economics Commentator Greg Ip worries <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-_?mblid=71106c5b9b8d&mbcid=32228092.3212673&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that solid evidence on how the government can best spur activity in the private sector is sparse.

Looking ahead...it’s probably too soon to judge Bidenomics: Major government programs take time to work and can have unexpected complications and side effects—so its full impact may not be felt until well after the pundit chatter recedes.—SK

Good morning. Spent a lazy Friday afternoon scrolling through Useless Etymology <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3q?mblid=0e216dc2ec92&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and discovered a few useless word facts maybe you can actually use to impress people at your brunch or pool party today.

Useless/Useful fact No. 1: The word “shark” was first used to describe an evil or nasty person long before it was the name of the animal.

Useless/Useful fact No. 2: The word “escalate” didn’t exist until about 30 years after “escalator” (it was formed by lopping off some letters from escalator).

Let us know how these go over—maybe you’ll just be called a nerd, and that’s OK!

GOVERNMENT

Our politicians are getting older <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3s?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden talking. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3s?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jim Watson/Getty Images
The conversation about why our country's leadership looks like the inside of a Perkins at 4pm is again sweeping the nation after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell froze up and stopped talking for a full 21 seconds during a press conference in DC this week.

He and his aides say he’s fine and plans to serve the rest of his term, but the event—and other recent health scares from older politicians—add to the growing concern from other politicians and constituents over the age and mental fitness of elderly public servants. By 7pm on the day of 81-year-old McConnell’s incident, Google searches had quadrupled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3t?mblid=2f32f8be3eda&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the term “gerontocracy,” which is a government controlled by old people.

Aging has no political party

McConnell, who has had multiple health problems in the past few years, might be in the spotlight now, but he’s only the fourth-oldest senator.

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein is the oldest person in office right now, and she, too, has struggled with ongoing health problems, some that left her absent from work for an extended stretch and prompted calls for her resignation. This week, she apparently had to be corrected twice during a hearing, once because she started giving remarks during roll call.

An April Reuters poll found that 44% of registered Democrats think Joe Biden shouldn’t run for reelection because of his age—he’s 80 and the oldest president we’ve ever had.

The same poll found 34% of Republicans think 77-year-old Trump is too old to run for the highest office in the land.

Big picture: Capitol Hill is no nest of spring chickens. Members of Congress born before 1946 only account for about 6% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3u?mblid=45fb0b38eb9c&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the entire governing body, which matches their share of the overall US population. But Baby Boomers (those born 1946–1964) make up nearly 49% of Congress compared to 21% of the US population. The average age of a member of Congress is 58 years old.—MM

The Emmy's have been postponed.

Pushed to…when? Maybe January? But a source told Variety that since the Golden Globes are that same month, a date hasn’t been cemented. This is the first time the Emmys have been postponed since 2001 following 9/11.

The Fed’s favorite inflation measure fell. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key data point for JPow and Co., last month grew <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3z?mblid=d1f192c2ada3&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by only 3% from the previous June—its lowest annual rise since 2021. Meanwhile, The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the employment cost index, another favored gauge that tracks wages and benefits, also rose by its slowest rate in two years. Powell said earlier this week that central bankers will be watching the data to decide whether to raise rates yet again in September, and these are signs that things are moving in the direction the Fed wants.

The Northwestern hazing scandal keeps growing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3A?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Northwestern University students at a football game. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3A?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Michael Reaves/Getty Images
Several former Northwestern University athletes have filed lawsuits against the school for emotional, physical, and psychological harm, and many more are expected to follow.

This comes after an investigation revealed widespread hazing in the Wildcat football program, which—along with firsthand accounts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3B?mblid=0f1cb71a78ad&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> published in the university’s student newspaper—led to the firing of head coach Pat Fitzgerald earlier this month.

According to former players…

Upperclassmen singled out teammates for coerced sexual acts, usually after they made a mistake on the field.

Former coaching staff made Black players cut off their dreadlocks, taunted Latino players with “jokes” about cleaning houses, and enabled white teammates to make racist comments.

Five former Northwestern football players have filed lawsuits against the university, its president, and its current and former athletic directors. It’s not just football: A former Northwestern volleyball player is also suing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3C?mblid=83c1b6beb2ac&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> over an alleged 2021 hazing incident, and the school’s baseball coach has been fired. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing former football players, said he expects to file more than 30 lawsuits on behalf of past Northwestern athletes.

Zoom out: Experts say this is a chance for other schools to reexamine their own programs. A 2016 NCAA survey found that 74% of college athletes get hazed.—ML

REAL ESTATE

Old homes are selling for more than new ones <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3G?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Old and new homes with price tags <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3G?mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
A house potentially haunted by the poltergeist of a long-deceased ex-resident will now cost you more than a brand-new place, upending the usual housing market order.

Axios found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3H?mblid=088fa066c8f2&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the median existing single-family home was going for $416,000 last month, while the median price tag for just-built ones was $600 lower.

The housing market typically prizes youth over history. Older homes have higher repair and energy costs, which lowers their attractiveness to buyers—a Victorian with ornate molding is charming only until the roof starts leaking.

Why is old now pricier than new?

It's mostly about interest rates: Since the Fed kept hiking them, the average 30-year mortgage rate now sits at 6.81%, more than double its lowest point during the pandemic. That’s making current homeowners, many of whom snagged their mortgages before prices went into the stratosphere, reluctant to sell their pad and borrow cash for a new one.

This creates a shortage of pre-owned homes on the market but no shortage of aspiring homeowners. Some developers have signaled they’re more than happy to swoop in with more affordable homes for first time buyers, as housing construction begins to recover from a precipitous decline last year.—SK

Stat: It’s official: Taylor Swift’s Era’s tour is not only propping up the economy, it’s also making the Earth move. The singer’s dancing fans at a pair of Seattle shows last weekend created seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3-magnitude earthquake <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a3M?mblid=becdb7015ab3&mbcid=32231915.2838526&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to measurements by seismologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach.

Good morning. This week, the countdown to the 2024 Olympics in Paris hit the one-year mark. Something to look forward to next summer? Breaking, aka break dancing, will make its debut as an Olympic sport.

But for the 2028 event in Los Angeles, the Olympics should go even bigger: the beer mile. Nothing tests an athlete’s stamina and gag reflex quite like running a mile while knocking back four beers. Earlier this month, Canada’s Corey Bellemore won the Beer Mile World Classic in Chicago with a time of 4:30.80…and he did it on one shoe.

July will be the hottest month ever <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WI?mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Graph of Daily Global Surface Air Temperature <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WI?mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Copernicus Climate Service/ERA5
How hot does it have to be for a month to be declared the hottest month on record when it’s not even over yet?

Approximately 62.51 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the global average temperature for July through the 23rd day of the month. That makes it the hottest month ever (barring a sudden ice age), according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization. Yesterday’s announcement prompted UN Secretary-General António Guterres to declare that the “era of global boiling has arrived.”

President Biden also entered the chat

Warning of the “existential threat of climate change,” the president announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WJ?mblid=ef0851d8503a&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> policies yesterday aimed at protecting workers at high risk of heat-related illness or death on the job.

Biden asked the Department of Labor to issue a heat hazard alert, which would mandate heat-related protections under federal law. Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law to eliminate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WK?mblid=f4c2930c1cd2&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> local rules mandating water breaks for construction workers, saying it creates too much red tape for business.

The president also called for increased inspections on farms and construction sites.

Other industries are also adjusting to the record heat. In the fragile airline industry, which is already juggling huge demand and worker shortages, the heat is disrupting operations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WL?mblid=63ecb3164be3&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> even further:

Warm air is less dense and requires planes to have longer runways and lighter weight to lift off, which can cause delays.

Workers on the tarmac need more frequent breaks from slinging Away suitcases.

It’s difficult to cool down a plane once it’s been disconnected from cooling units at the gate. Left idling, an aircraft’s cabin temperature can reach a dangerous level—such was the case with a Delta flight last week in Las Vegas. The airline is under investigation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WN?mblid=0f0ee20ecf7a&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for leaving passengers on the tarmac in a sweltering plane without A/C for hours.

It’s not going to get better soon. Forty percent of the US population was under a heat advisory yesterday as dangerous temps move East and roast the heavily populated I-95 corridor (hello from sweaty Brew HQ). Phoenix, AZ, can sympathize: Wednesday marked the 27th day in a row that temps reached 110 degrees.—CC

The latest figures show that not only is the US economy not spiraling into a recession due to interest rate hikes, it’s actually getting stronger as the year goes on. And for the cherry on top, underlying inflation rose at its slowest pace in two years. This could be a sign of the “soft landing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WS?mblid=d53e6be05bd7&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” Fed Chair Jerome Powell fantasized about.

Trump hit with new charges in classified documents probe.

Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination for president, denied the new allegations. But another set of criminal charges over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol could be headed his way shortly.

Tesla reportedly created a team to swat away range complaints. Last year, the automaker was so overwhelmed with complaints around its cars’ ranges that it formed a group known internally as the “Diversion Team” to cancel thousands <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WT?mblid=84469baf9e68&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of range-related customer service appointments, a Reuters investigation revealed. The reason customers had so many complaints, according to the report, was because Tesla advertised range estimates that its cars simply weren’t capable of. One recent study showed that three Tesla models had an average range 26% below what the company boasted.

That’s because finding a high-skilled job as a Chinese youth feels futile.

Highly coveted public-sector jobs are extremely competitive (one 24-year-old told CNN that 30,000 people applied for three job openings at a city government).

Plus, real estate and tech, two industries that employ a lot of recent grads, haven’t fully recovered from Covid or this year’s government crackdowns.

Few stuffed animals have been more popular among adults than children, and even fewer feel like they’re filled with beans.

The Beanie Bubble—the movie about Beanie Babies, the plush toys that people mistakenly thought would make them rich—hits Apple TV+ today, joining a growing club of new films devoted to putting wigs on A-list actors so they can play out the origin stories of iconic products.

At the toy’s peak, things got wild: The $5 pellet-stuffed plushies had astronomical appreciation estimates that prompted people to buy tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of dolls, smuggle them into the US, fight over collections of them in divorce court, and in one instance, actually commit murder.

The manufacturer, Ty Inc., enjoyed a brief period of Barbie-level sales—and sent each employee home with a holiday bonus equal to their annual salary—before the bubble burst, leaving millions of people with bins of dusty Beanies in their basements.

While it seems obvious now that Beanie Babies could only ride their wave for so long before crashing down to the depths of eBay, hindsight’s 20/20, and toy creator Ty Warner masterminded some very clever distribution tactics that made people think they had to line up outside a Hallmark store at 4am if they wanted to retire rich.

Stat: Welp—cheap gas prices were fun while they lasted. The average price for a gallon in the US rose to an eight-month high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9X2?mblid=e53244c6d76b&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday of $3.71, per AAA. While that’s far below last summer’s peak of $5.02 per gallon, gas prices have been creeping up due to refineries going offline unexpectedly and higher demand for oil at a time when supply isn’t there to meet it. Bloomberg Opinion’s oil guru, Javier Blas, notes that global oil consumption has likely reached a record high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9X3?mblid=5628cb4ac369&mbcid=32218508.3181768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Markets: The good times kept on rolling for the Dow, which notched its 11th straight day of gains yesterday for its best streak <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J3?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=669ac76e7fdf> since February 2017. But there’s a lot coming up that could impact the markets this week, from Big Tech earnings (Microsoft and Alphabet report today) to a likely rate hike from the Fed tomorrow. Barbenheimer’s success this weekend sent pink sparkly vibes to the trading floor: Mattel, IMAX, and AMC (which also got a big boost from a recent ruling blocking a planned stock conversion) were all up.

Israel passes divisive law curbing Supreme Court’s power <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J4?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Israel protesters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J4?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Amir Levy/Getty Images
Israel’s Parliament passed a controversial bill diminishing the power of its Supreme Court yesterday, further energizing massive protests against the reforms that have been rocking the country since January and threatening the stability of its economy.

The new law limits the high court’s ability to overrule decisions made by the government, such as by allowing previously disqualified officials to serve in top positions. And it’s just the first part of a polarizing effort <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J5?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc6925e56c25> by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing in Israel's history, to overhaul the court system. Further steps (which Netanyahu has postponed until November) would give the executive and legislative branches more control over appointing Supreme Court justices and reduce independent legal oversight of ministries.

It’s hard to overstate the stakes: Critics say the judicial overhaul removes checks and balances from the government, threatening Israel’s very democracy, while the governing coalition maintains it will strengthen democracy by limiting overreach by unelected justices.

Much of Israeli society is not on board: 150 large companies went on strike in protest, army reservists vowed to not show up to duty if the law passed, and demonstrators in Jerusalem showed a willingness to risk getting drenched in “skunk water” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J6?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=452aa90e3a15> by police.

A recent poll shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9J7?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aae283de6365> that 68% of Israel’s startups are reacting to the anticipated judicial reform with various measures that include moving money, employees, and/or headquarters out of the country.

The Israeli shekel was the world’s worst performing currency yesterday after a volatile day of trading that showed investors’ concern about domestic politics weighing on it.

Looking ahead…Moody’s downgraded the country’s economic prospects in April, citing the “deterioration of Israel’s governance” in light of the planned judicial overhaul.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> Buoys set up by Texas to deter migrants in the Rio Grande Brandon Bell/Getty Images
The DOJ sued Texas over its Rio Grande buoy barrier. The Department Of Justice lodged the lawsuit after warning the state it would do so if the buoys set up to stop migrants from crossing into the US from Mexico were not removed (to which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott responded “Texas will see you in court, Mr. President”). The lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jb?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ee3ff9bc47f> claims Texas violated the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Biden administration asserts the unauthorized border boundary has caused both humanitarian and diplomatic troubles. The state’s actions are part of Operation Lone Star, a program that uses police resources to address migration, which Gov. Abbott says is necessary because the federal government is not enforcing immigration law.

The IRS won’t come to the door anymore. The tax agency will no longer make unannounced visits <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jc?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fbe062f14c7c> to taxpayer’s homes or businesses to collect payments due (at least in most cases). The IRS said it was halting the controversial practice, which has been around since at least the 1950s, to protect its agents’ safety. Instead, the agency will send out letters requesting that the taxpayer schedule an appointment. In specific cases, such as to deliver a summons or subpoena or seize assets, an unannounced visit may still occur, but there are only a few hundred of those each year compared to tens of thousands of the more routine visits, according to Reuters.

Adidas’s Yeezy sales are breezy. It turns out that even when sneakers get canceled, you can still move a lot of them: Adiadas has started selling off the stockpile of Yeezys it was stuck with after cutting ties with Ye over the rapper’s antisemitic remarks, and sales are strong. In its first new online sale since pulling the shoes in the fall, Adidas got orders for 4 million pairs worth €508 million (~$562 million), according to the Financial Times. And yesterday, Adidas said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jd?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a4dd87b90efb> the strong sales mean it’s now on track to lose €450 million ($498.56 million) this year rather than the previously predicted €700 million.

There’s finally research to support what stressed high-school seniors have long believed: The ultra-wealthy have a big leg up at top universities.

A Harvard-based group of economists says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jf?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fea187120bc3> children from the richest 1% of families are more than twice as likely to attend Stanford, Duke, the University of Chicago, and the Ivy League universities as students with the same SAT or ACT scores but lower family incomes, based on admissions data from 1999 to 2015.

Among these institutions…

The richest applicants had the highest nonacademic scores—which combine extracurriculars, personality traits, and recommendation letters—and especially the students from secular private schools, who were twice as likely to be accepted as public school competitors.

Children of alumni were more than twice as likely to get in as non-legacy applicants, regardless of family income. But legacy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Jg?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e803f20b47ef> applicants in the top 0.1% were eight times as likely to be admitted compared to average acceptance rates for similarly performing students.

One in eight elite college attendees from the top 1% were recruited athletes, compared to just one in 20 admits from the bottom 60% of family incomes.

Last week, Neopets ushered in a new era of the very game that likely started your internet addiction.

Neopets, under new ownership and management, is embarking on a relaunch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9II?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5f202bc10bd3> and betting on nostalgia to bring users back to the land of giant omelettes and Poogle racing.

What happened to Neopets? The virtual world of magical pets peaked in 2005 with 25 million users but due to a lack of resources and aging site features (especially after the discontinuation of Adobe Flash), the platform devolved. By 2020, there were only 100,000 average daily users. It tried to save itself with trendy new features—such as NFTs and cryptocurrency—but ultimately ditched those efforts.

Now, after raising $4 million in funding this year, the company <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9IJ?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b52b9b94c72c> is embarking on a faerie quest of its own. Here’s what you and your Kougra can look forward to:

A new home screen and, as of today, 50 updated versions of old Neopets games.

World of Neopets, a mobile game and 3D simulation (presumably, something like Animal Crossing).

A re-release of the often infuriatingly glitchy Island Builders video game will arrive in early 2024.

There’s more: If the new features aren’t enough to entice you back, maybe the new Neopets brand ambassador will—it’s Emmy/Grammy/Oscar/Tony-winning artist John Legend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9IK?mbcid=32179409.2769729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=40437c2af2f9>.—CC

Answering the question “Can memes translate to ticket sales?” once and for all, Barbie and Oppenheimer gave North American movie theaters their best weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived four years ago.

Both movies dismantled expectations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EZ?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3364ab757075> and put up historic numbers.

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie pulled in $155 million, good for the best opening of the year and the best domestic opening for a woman director in history.

Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s saga about the father of the atomic bomb, grossed $80.5 million. That’s a remarkable haul for an R-rated movie (especially a historical drama that lasts three hours), and it far outpaced projections of $50 million.

While the two critically acclaimed films may have been successful on their own, their unique pairing had people thinking “Well, I want to see one, so I might as well see the other too.” About 200,000 moviegoers bought tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9E-?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4bb69034011c> to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day this weekend in North America, per the trade group the National Association of Theater Owners.

What can we learn from Barbenheimer’s success?

Both movies offered a “more than a movie” experience. For Barbie, that meant dressing up in pink with your friends and recapturing your childhood relationship with the doll. For Oppenheimer, it meant going to an IMAX screen to lose yourself in the spectacle. IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said 4am showings of Oppenheimer were sold out around the world this weekend.

Original storytelling can be a commercial hit. Barbenheimer, comprising two creatively ambitious films from outside-the-box directors, was successful at a time when studios may have squeezed all the juice they can out of tired IP. The fifth Indiana Jones disappointed, the seventh Mission: Impossible underwhelmed, and Disney plans to pull back on making Star Wars and Marvel content.

Bottom line: The movie industry will cheers to Barbenheimer till the champagne runs dry because there’s little else worth celebrating. More than 100,000 Hollywood actors and writers are on strike, sending movie production—and promotion—into a deep freeze that shows no signs of thawing.

Ditching Twitter’s classic branding is the clearest indication yet that Musk intends to create an “everything app” under a new company called X Corp. But whether its logo is a bird or an X, the social media company remains in a deep financial hole: Just last week, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management wrote down its stake in Twitter by 47%.

The issue is that the market caps of tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia have gotten so big recently that when we refer to “the Nasdaq,” we’re actually just talking about a few companies that hold outsized influence (even after the changes, Apple and Microsoft will account for 22% of the index’s weighting).

Even as sizzling US cities thrum with the sound of air conditioners, power grids in the hottest states have shown few signs of buckling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9F7?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=95b3c8adcc22>, the WSJ reported.

California utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it would be able to meet heightened demand for electricity this summer, while the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is known for being not that reliable, hasn’t asked residents to conserve electricity since last month—even as power demand hit a new record last week.

It’s a “pinch me, I’m dreaming” moment for grids that were hit with dangerous blackouts during extreme weather events in the past few years. But you’re not dreaming—there are real reasons why power grids are holding up during the heat waves of summer 2023:

California’s record snowpack in the winter has given a major boost to hydropower. In May, hydropower produced more electricity than any month in the previous three years, per California’s grid operator.

In renewable energy powerhouse Texas, solar capacity is more than twice the amount installed at the same point last year.

Recently expanded battery storage in both states can be tapped as an emergency lifeline when the power grid is strained.

It’s a similar story in Europe where, despite the relentless heat, grids are doing their job <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9F8?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=69ca216e33ce>.

Looking ahead…it’s still July, and power demand could burden power systems as the calendar turns into steamy August.

Stat: Some may call it pop and some may call it soda, but one thing many US states have in common is rock-bottom unemployment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Fg?mbcid=32168184.3193946&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2a9a9e36bd46>.

Despite what the internet may tell you, building a successful DTC empire doesn’t happen overnight. Once you’ve established a customer base, success can often boil down to two things: customer engagement and loyalty <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z1?lp=text1&mbadid=7148325391bbd9c45feb84fd14816824&mbadv=a&mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, two of the hardest things to earn as a new brand.

  SNAPSHOT

  Photo of the week <#> U.S. Park Ranger Eric Henson (R) pretends to be cold while posing next to the unofficial thermometer at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center indicating a temperature of 132 degrees Fahrenheit David McNew/Getty Images Park rangers at Death Valley National Park took a picture with the Instagrammable thermometer in Furnace Creek last Sunday. The joke is that typically in extremely hot weather, you wear fewer layers, but the rangers decided it would be funny to put on jackets and act cold.

Btw, this particular thermometer is known for overstating temps—it didn’t actually reach 132 degrees Fahrenheit. But a more legitimate preliminary measure did record a temperature of 120 degrees at midnight in Death Valley last week.

Scientists say the discovery of this preserved battle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CS?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=674100446483> from 125 million years ago contributes to mounting evidence that prehistoric ecosystems were complicated, with mammals sometimes turning the tables on larger reptilian neighbors. But nobody won this particular round—the mid-conflict preservation likely means the animals were too busy fighting to dodge the volcanic ash mudslide that entombed them.

It’s okay to only exercise on weekends. Squeezing in your recommended 150 minutes of moderate activity into one or two days a week is about as effective at staving off heart disease and stroke as regular exercise, according to a new study. By analyzing 90,000 people’s medical records and biometrics, researchers found that relative to couch potatoes, weekend warriors <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CT?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ed43cc121322> had a 27% lower risk of heart attack and a 21% lower risk of stroke. Meanwhile, regular exercisers saw the same risks lowered by 35% and 17% compared to the sedentary. Heart failure numbers were even more impressive: a 38% risk reduction for weekend exercisers, compared to 36% for people who hit the gym on workdays.

Schools still call mom more than dad. Now there are numbers to back up what mothers have long complained about: In straight couples, schools phone them more than fathers. Researchers emailed over 30,000 US principals and asked them to call one of two numbers, for a fictitious mom or dad, to discuss potentially enrolling their imaginary child. When principals responded, they called mom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CU?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4350871f6acc> 59% of the time. Even when researchers specified that mom was busy, she was still called 26% of the time, compared to just 10% for dads who were said to be busy.—ML

Christopher Nolan’s sprawling, star-studded thriller centers on the life of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, aka the father of the atomic bomb. The three-hour IMAX spectacle draws from a correspondingly hefty tome: the 721-page biography <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CX?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=148ef1a13cdc> American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.

To sum up (with no spoilers for anyone who’s taken a US history class): It chronicles <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9CY?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6c674c8f1c56> Oppenheimer heading the Los Alamos Laboratory responsible for executing the Manhattan Project during World War II, his troubled postwar years grappling with the terrifying implications of his work, and his falling out with the government during the Cold War.

Who was Oppenheimer, really?

Oppenheimer’s internal conflicts and tumultuous circumstances make his life the perfect fodder for dramatic depiction. Despite being just one (very influential) person, he fits into a large number of roles.

The troubled genius: In his college days, Oppenheimer suffered from mental health challenges, including severe depression. He also experienced deep jealousy and acted on it, once poisoning an apple and putting it on his professor’s desk at Cambridge.

The underdog: Though he was an accomplished scientist, Oppenheimer was an unlikely choice to lead a massive lab tasked with developing cutting-edge weapons of mass destruction before Nazi Germany did. One colleague said he wouldn’t trust Oppenheimer to run a hamburger joint, Bird and Sherwin wrote in American Prometheus.

The national hero: In 1943, Brigadier General Leslie Groves took a gamble and appointed Oppenheimer as the lead scientist on the Manhattan Project, putting him in charge of a research dream team composed of brainiacs including Richard Feynman, Enrico Fermi, and Niels Bohr. Oppenheimer finally said “I guess it worked” in the summer of 1945, after witnessing the first successful detonation of a nuclear weapon in history during a test in the New Mexico desert. Atomic bombs were soon dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan’s unconditional surrender.

The conscientious campaigner: After the war, the violent destruction Oppenheimer’s invention caused in Japan weighed on him. Recalling his thoughts upon seeing the bomb successfully explode, he famously quoted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9C-?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb979426e87b> Hindu scripture: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” He also told President Truman he felt he had blood on his hands—a conversation that reportedly didn’t go well <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9C_?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7dcd62c9b50a>. He advocated for arms control and, in 1949, opposed Truman’s plan for a more powerful hydrogen bomb.

The tragic figure: Postwar America was a bad time to campaign against weapons of mass destruction as the government became obsessed with building more of them to counter the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer’s leftist sympathies and Communist Party-affiliated wife aroused suspicions of disloyalty at a time when many people were accused of being communist spies. He was stripped of his security clearance after a voluntary hearing at the US Atomic Energy Commission (it got posthumously restored in 2022).

The pariah: The entire ordeal left Oppenheimer severely depressed and feeling like his legacy was tarnished. He spent many of his remaining years in self-imposed exile, splitting his time between Princeton and the tiny US Virgin Island of St. John until he died in 1967 at age 62.

What role does Oppenheimer play today?

Understanding why Oppenheimer’s story resonates now is certainly much easier than figuring out what’s going on in Inception. The parallels to artificial intelligence, another technology that scares its own creators, aren’t exactly subtle. Nolan himself said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qQ?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3e4c18b71e2e> he believes the film is a “cautionary tale” for Silicon Valley.

Kai Bird, coauthor of the book the film is based on, wrote in an Op-Ed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D9?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=81cc52d5181c> for the New York Times that Oppenheimer’s legacy should push the government to heed the warnings of tech trailblazers urging caution, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Nolan claims he’s heard AI researchers talking of being in their own “Oppenheimer moment,” and he hopes the film could teach them a thing or two about taking responsibility for their inventions.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: The world’s biggest IMAX screens <#> General views of the TCL Chinese Theatre promoting the new Christopher Nolan film 'Oppenheimer' in IMAX on July 20, 2023 AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Watching Oppenheimer in a standard movie theater is kind of like eating “New York-style pizza” in a Dallas strip mall. It gets the job done, but it’s not the pinnacle of the experience.

For that, you’d have to travel to one of 30 IMAX theaters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D4?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8ea10732fb81> around the world equipped to project Nolan’s 70-millimeter print of the film. Nineteen of those screens are in the US, while 11 are abroad in Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Czech Republic. The one I’m trying (and failing) to get a ticket to, the AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City, measures 97 feet wide and 76 feet tall.

Nolan told the AP <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9D5?mbcid=32155714.3190990&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a86b37aaa126> that seeing Oppenheimer on one of these 30 screens makes for the “best possible experience” because they’re the only ones with the aspect ratios that can faithfully capture the resolution he shot the film in. An IMAX devotee since The Dark Night, Nolan used 65mm cameras for Oppenheimer that are among the highest-resolution cameras in existence. Consider: The HD screen on your home TV has 1,920 pixels of resolution per frame, while the IMAX resolution has 18,000 pixels.

But all that clarity takes up a lot of physical space, making the film stock a logistical challenge for theaters to project. The Oppenheimer film stock weighs about 600 pounds and spans more than 11 miles; at NYC’s Lincoln Square, they used a forklift to pick it up.

Which is why most people who see Oppenheimer will catch the standard digital presentation. And that, according to Nolan, will be just fine.—NF

ChatGPT seems to be getting dumber <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eg?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> ChatGPT logo with magnifying glass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eg?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The accuracy of OpenAI’s generative language model appears to have declined so much this spring that it’s giving high-school seniors wearing sunglasses in calculus a run for their money.

A not-yet-peer-reviewed study by Stanford and Berkeley researchers of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 found a huge difference <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eh?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=144ce33dc017> in the chatbot’s answers between March and June of this year—often for the worse, something people were already reporting anecdotally online.

GPT-4 went from 97.6% accuracy in identifying prime numbers a few months ago to only…2.4% in June.

The newer version of the language model got better at fending off problematic prompts, like coming up with illegal money-making schemes. But rather than explaining why queries are troublesome, it’s now more likely to simply say something like, “Sorry, but I can’t assist with that.”

When asked to create computer code, GPT-4 generated functional work 52% of the time in March and only 10% of the time in June. The lines of code it provided weren’t wrong, but they started to be accompanied by nonusable text, which could create headaches for companies trying to integrate ChatGPT into programming workflows.

The researchers say the change in ChatGPT’s behavior in such a short time is likely because OpenAI is tweaking its product. But because the company keeps its work so private, it’s hard for anyone to tell exactly what’s caused ChatGPT to start flunking. OpenAI says it’s looking into these “reported regressions.”

But more transparency may be coming soon…Yesterday, representatives from seven companies leading the AI charge—including OpenAI—convened at the White House and agreed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Ei?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ab3576e8ddf3> to guidelines that include more safety tests before product releases, a watermarking system for AI-generated content, and more disclosure of the technology’s vulnerabilities. If the companies break their promises, it could land them in hot water with the FTC.—ML

Crooner Tony Bennett has died at age 96. The legendary singer of “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” died <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EQ?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=68b9e8eb5574> yesterday following a yearslong battle with Alzheimer’s disease, during which he continued to record music and perform. Bennett’s career focused on the Great American Songbook and spanned more than seven decades. Though popular music styles changed drastically during that period, he never lost his relevance—his final performance was a concert and television special with Lady Gaga. The celebrated performer was also active in politics, especially during the Civil Rights Movement: He participated in the march from Selma to Montgomery with Martin Luther King Jr.

In an order handed down yesterday, Florida federal Judge Aileen Cannon rejected the ex-president and 2024 hopeful’s bid to postpone the trial until after the election, as well as the government’s preferred trial date in December. It’s one of several criminal investigations involving Trump, who refers to them as hoaxes. He recently signaled that he may be indicted soon in a separate probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ​​

Disney might let sports leagues buy a piece of ESPN.

Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research, the FTX-affiliated crypto trading firm the company allegedly funneled customer funds to.

Not since the Full House reboot has a city been so hopeful about a San Francisco cultural staple comeback. After Sapporo USA announced plans to shut down Anchor Brewing Company, the oldest craft brewery in the country, the brewer’s unionized employees offered to buy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9En?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=30b151ab62b5> it.

The workers sent a letter to Sapporo USA this week saying they want to purchase the legacy brewer and turn it into a co-op.

Some background: Anchor was founded in 1896 and is credited with spurring the craft beer craze in the 1970s. In 2017, it was acquired by Sapporo Breweries, a Japanese beer company, for $85 million.

Blaming “a combination of challenging economic factors and declining sales,” Sapporo USA said last week it would liquidate the 127-year-old brewery starting August 2, ending an era where people could confidently say their great-grandparents used to order the same craft brew. But workers told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Eo?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a84de8d95f52> VinePair the Tokyo-based brewer had mismanaged the local staple.

The Hail Mary. While the final terms of the proposal (including price) are still being worked out, there are about 40 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 6 that hope Sapporo USA will accept their longshot bid and give them a chance to turn the business around.—MM

Even as the heat wave made it unsafe to work outside this week, Dallas-area meteorologist Pete Delkus delivered a severe burn to a colleague inside the studio. While on-air discussing the region’s extreme heat, he noticed that a heat index graphic listed McKinney, TX, as 101,105 degrees Fahrenheit—or ~10x the temperature on the surface of the sun, per Awful Announcing—and the weatherman couldn’t resist a little ad-lib <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EB?mbcid=32159845.2807729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=24913e73f580> roast of its designer.

Today marks the theatrical release of two movies that will forever be associated with each other despite having nothing in common: Greta Gerwig’s pink parade of Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s devastating biopic about the man who created a potentially world-ending bomb, Oppenheimer. And viewers have never been more amped to have whiplash.

The same-day releases from these beloved directors have created an internet memestorm of poster mashups <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AK?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=39eac3b1af76>, merch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AL?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f91b57eec64a>, and a new question to judge everyone’s tastes by: “What’s the correct order to see Barbenheimer?” We’ll take an exit poll of the 40,000+ members of the AMC Stubs program who have tickets to see both movies on the same day.

Opposites attract bigger audiences

Barbenheimer takes a page out of the well-worn Hollwyood playbook known as counterprogramming, in which studios release very different films on the same day to attract wider audiences. In the past, theaters have typically offered a film for dads to enjoy while their kids watch cartoons, or played a light rom-com in the theater next to a screen showing a psycho killer stalking teens.

Some examples:

This same July weekend 15 years ago, Christopher Nolan was a part of another famous double bill when his The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia! hit theaters on the same day. Both movies got butts in seats on opening weekend, though Heath Ledger’s legendary Joker performance brought in $158 million compared to the ABBA musical’s $27.7 million.

Sometimes, the singing hits the right notes. Both Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road opened the same weekend in May 2015, and the a cappella romp scored $69.2 million vs. $45.4 million for the apocalyptic hellscape tale.

Bottom line: Counterprogramming done right can benefit both movies, giving each more visibility than it would have gotten entering the box office solo. We’ll see if that plays out this weekend. Analysts are expecting Margot Robbie and all her dolls to bring in $90 million–$115 million. Nolan and the bomb squad are looking at ticket sales closer to $60 million. Anything at the top end of those ranges would be a relief to movie theaters that have been eerily quiet this summer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9A_?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f2ca664970bf>.—MM

Tour de headlines <#> Team co-owner Dan Snyder speaks during the announcement of the Washington Football Team's name change to the Washington Commanders at FedExField on February 02, 2022 in Landover, Maryland Rob Carr/Getty Images
The Dan Snyder era is over in DC. NFL owners approved the sale <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AR?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=617c5db5c938> of the Washington Commanders to private equity investor Josh Harris, bringing Dan Snyder’s turbulent and controversial 20+ years at the helm to a close. The team’s price of $6.05 billion is a record for an NFL franchise, but Snyder will have to give up some of his windfall right away. He was fined $60 million by the league following an investigation that found he sexually harassed a former employee and that the Commanders withheld revenue from other NFL teams.

Car thefts up, violent crimes down in US cities. Motor vehicle thefts in 32 large US cities jumped 34% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AS?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7175815d1817> in the first six months of 2023 from the same period last year and are 104% higher than early 2019 levels, per a report from the Council on Criminal Justice. The think tank attributed much of the increase to a surge in thefts of certain Kia and Hyundai models after a TikTok challenge exposed how easy it was to steal them. Meanwhile, homicides are down 9.4% across 30 large cities in the first six months of the year.

Air travel could get less frustrating. In bipartisan fashion, the House passed a bill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AT?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9f044c092b61> that aims to alleviate the worker shortage that’s been plaguing the airline industry. The legislation is broadly about reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration for the next five years, but it also includes measures that would raise the retirement age for pilots from 65 to 67 and boost the recruitment and training of other airline industry employees, especially those critical air-traffic controllers. The bill will now head to the Senate, which is debating its own version of the bill.

Russia has been attacking Ukraine’s port cities all week after pulling out of a yearlong agreement that allowed cargo ships to safely haul grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea.

Ukraine is a major global provider of wheat, corn, and oilseeds—especially to countries in Africa and the Middle East—so grain prices have risen considerably over concerns of possible shortages.

Russia exited the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative on Monday, but it wasn’t until Wednesday—when Russia said it might treat any Ukraine-bound cargo ship as hostile—that wheat prices spiked by 8.5%. That was the largest daily increase since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.

Since pulling out of the deal, Russia has targeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AV?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e657c061d988> two of Ukraine’s seaports and reportedly laid mines along the coast. Nightly missile and drone attacks have killed and wounded civilians, destroyed agricultural infrastructure, and burned enough grain to feed more than 270,000 people for a year, according to the World Food Program.

What now? Ukraine can still ship grain through the EU via road and rail, which is one reason why traders say they don’t think there will be a global grain shortage. But these routes are more expensive, and the nations that rely on Ukrainian grain might turn instead to Russia, the world’s top wheat exporter.—ML

Skims, the shapewear and intimates clothing brand founded by Kim Kardashian, reached a $4 billion valuation this week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Ao?mbcid=32146707.2762920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0030ed6a214>, according to the New York Times. Now worth more than twice Victoria’s Secret (shhh), Skims is getting ready for its call-up to the big leagues: an IPO.

Wellington Management, which led Skims’s latest funding round, famously works with companies before they launch an IPO.

The company is expecting $750 million in sales this year, and is planning on extending into men’s clothing and opening physical stores, chief executive Jens Grede told the New York Times.

After the latest funding round, Kim can finally afford that yoga membership. The new valuation (up from $3.2 billion in January) adds an estimated $500 million to her nearly $2 billion fortune, per Forbes’s calculations, which she’s amassed from her various businesses, including Skims and the skincare line Skkn.

In a wave of strike activity the US hasn’t seen since the 1970s, more than 650,000 American workers are either planning to walk off the job or have already done so this summer, according to Bloomberg. Not only are more than 100,000 Hollywood actors and writers on strike, but 340,000 UPS workers and employees at Detroit’s Big Three automakers could also hit the picket line next month.

In 2019, when Olivia was four, she was burned when a “dangerously hot” McNugget fell on her leg in the drive-thru lane at a South Florida McDonald’s, and her family sued for $15 million in damages. A jury found McDonald’s and its franchise were liable for Olivia’s injury, but thought $800k was the proper restitution for a nugget burn.

Good morning. Our inbox was a house divided yesterday. Many of you agreed with Cassandra that Apple Maps has been severely underrated for years, while hundreds of other readers claimed Google Maps was still No. 1 in their hearts and on their homescreens.

But maybe the entire debate over which navigation app is better misses the bigger picture. Maybe we should spend less time figuring out where to go next and just be happy with where we are now.

Markets: The Q2 earnings season kept investors smiling yesterday, with the Dow clinching <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wB?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aae0c007bc59> its eighth consecutive day in the green—its longest winning streak since September 2019.

Stock spotlight: Carvana’s stock shot up yesterday after it announced a deal to reduce its debt by more than $1.2 billion. In case you thought we left meme stocks in 2020 with our sourdough starters, the used car-seller jumped 43% in the first six minutes of trading for the day, per Bloomberg. Though it later lost some of those gains, it’s still up more than 1,100% for the year.

The US Team roster looks the same…and different

The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) is gunning for its third victory in a row after winning in 2015 and 2019. If they don’t get it, it’s not from lack of experience: The roster features nine players from the 2019 team and five from the 2015 team, including household names Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan.

The World Cup veterans will play alongside promising newcomers including Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman, whose names you’ll likely recognize soon.

There’s big money at stake

Sponsorships and broadcasters are spending big on women’s sports after focusing on men’s sports for, well, forever. The Women’s World Cup prize pool is still a quarter of the Men’s ($110 million compared to $440 million) but changes in the industry signal that might not be the case in the future:

For the first time, every player in the tournament is guaranteed $30,000 in prize money, and the prize pool more than tripled from 2019.

Fox Sports, which has broadcasting rights for the tournament, reported that they were nearly sold out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wE?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ce66022853b6> of all ad inventory last month.

ACL injuries are on a tear

Many top players will be absent from the field due to anterior cruciate ligament tears plaguing women’s soccer.

While women are at a higher risk of ACL injury than men, many researchers and players cite the historical lack of resources for professional women’s soccer teams as the root of the problem.

‍‍‍ Netflix got a lot more subscribers. Netflix’s decision to force you to sever that last tie to your ex by cracking down on password sharing is paying off: It gained 5.9 million subscribers last quarter. And, while other media companies struggle to navigate the transition to streaming, business is looking pretty good <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wJ?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f79333b7676a> at OG streamer Netflix, which now has extra cash on hand since the Hollywood strikes have dried up spending on content. But the company’s revenue fell short of expectations, and Netflix said in a letter to shareholders, “While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth.”

Apple built its own AI chatbot. Having finally worked out the kinks in Apple Maps, Apple engineers have been quietly toiling to make sure it doesn’t miss out on tech’s next big thing: AI.

Apple hasn’t decided how to release the tech to consumers yet, but when it does, we assume it will be similar to ChatGPT but sleeker-looking and more expensive. Apple’s stock price shot to record high on the news.

But investors were rattled by the company’s profit margin getting smaller because of those same slashed prices, especially since Elon Musk said on a call with analysts that if macroeconomic conditions are “not stable,” then prices might need to go even lower. Musk also noted that production would be down next quarter because of factory upgrades, but said it wouldn’t stop the company from meeting its delivery goals for the year.

Last week, Temu, the Chinese e-commerce app offering dirt-cheap products, filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wN?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=05b39a10f5b0> an antitrust lawsuit in a US federal court against Shein, the…other Chinese fast-fashion app that does the exact same thing, claiming Shein forced manufacturers to ditch Temu.

The court filings allege Shein bullied 8,338 separate suppliers in China into signing loyalty agreements that banned them from producing Temu products and slapped fines on anyone who dared to work with the rival company.

The retailers’ lawyers are well-acquainted

The companies are also duking it out in a different federal court after Shein accused Temu of hiring influencers to degrade the brand, and other misdeeds.

There’s a reason they’re fighting so hard:

Shein brings in $30 billion a year in sales, eclipsing other legacy fast-fashion brands like Forever 21 and H&M.

But it’s now being challenged by copycats like Temu that are starting to beat the OG at its own game: US spending on Temu was 20% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wO?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eba71392d961> higher than Shein in May.

There’s a viral trend on TikTok called NPC streaming, and it’s like if cosplay and choose-your-own-adventure books had a chronically online baby who made you feel like you were inside a broken record.

People are paying livestreamers to mimic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wU?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c265f8022a9a> the actions of NPCs, non-playable video game characters, and robotically recite nonsensical phrases of the payer’s choosing, for hours on end.

Here’s how it works:

People watching a TikToker’s livestream “tip” them with virtual coins (one TikTok coin = a little more than one real penny) which are sent to creators in the form of virtual icons that  have certain values.

Creators see the icons in real time and respond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wV?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=487e5bc6e551> by performing a corresponding action, which entices viewers to throw their cash. Some say that being able to control the streamers’ actions is sexual, but others (including some of the streamers themselves) say it’s just plain fun.

It pays: One of the most popular NPC streamers, Pinkydoll, says “ice cream so good” when she’s tipped with an ice cream cone icon—that one only costs one coin, so she says it a lot. She has amassed more than 500,000 followers and spends six hours a day on TikTok, making $2,000 to $3,000 per stream. She has even attracted a new top viewer: Timbaland <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wW?mbcid=32134287.2824999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=76e446928013>.—ML

TRAVEL

Record heat threatens to upend European tourism <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uw?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Woman in fountain amid heat wave <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uw?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
A stifling heat wave is sweeping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ux?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6939e90e441> across southern Europe just as Spain, Italy, and Greece host record crowds of international tourists finally letting loose after years of pandemic restrictions.

You won’t see it on their Instagram Stories, but your friends traipsing through Europe are probably spending their days in the shade and chugging water.

Yesterday, the high temp in Rome was 104 degrees Fahrenheit and 102 degrees in Madrid, and the Sunday forecast for Athens is 107 degrees. According to meteorologists, peak temperatures in Europe could break the Continent’s record of 119.8 degrees observed in Sicily two years ago.

Local authorities are telling folks to skip the daytime Old Town stroll and shelter inside since such heat can turn deadly.

The heat might cool travel interest

Sweltering summers aren’t just harmful to human health but also to the tourism-reliant Mediterranean economies. Euro travelers who watched their selfie sticks melt during similar heat waves last summer might be taking their next trip to a cooler climate.

There’s been a 10% annual decline in interest in Mediterranean travel among Europeans between June and November this year, according to the European Travel Commission.

This could benefit destinations further north, like Denmark and Ireland, which have seen increased travel interest.

More people might still travel to southern Europe during the cooler months, but it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to make up for the loss of summer sightseeing traffic. Italy’s Environment Ministry expects heat to bring a net loss to tourism, a setback for a country that counted on visitors for 10.2% of its GDP last year, per the World Travel & Tourism Council.

Plot twist: In the Southwest US, some visitors are being drawn to the heat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uZ?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e3dd36e8ac79>. People (some wearing fur coats!) have been flocking to Death Valley, CA, in recent days to take pictures with an Instagram-friendly thermometer showing otherworldly temperatures. On Sunday, the mercury in Furnace Creek in Death Valley hit 128 degrees, six degrees short of the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth.

A US soldier was detained in North Korea. In a bizarre situation, an American soldier willingly strolled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9tX?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f265d89d5045> into Kim Jong Un’s territory yesterday and is believed to be in North Korean detention. The soldier was being sent back to the US from South Korea for disciplinary action when he weaseled his way onto a tour of the Joint Security Area, according to CBS News. Then, according to a witness, he “suddenly gives out a loud ‘ha ha ha,’ and just runs in between some buildings.” Tensions between the US and North Korea are already high after a nuclear-armed US sub arrived in a South Korean port yesterday in what North Korea called an American provocation.

In Trump’s words on Truth Social, such a letter “almost always means an arrest and indictment.” If indicted over his role in the insurrection, it would be the third but by far the most consequential set of charges Trump has faced this year. But, despite his mounting legal woes, he remains the clear frontrunner to capture the GOP nomination for president.

While releasing tech you worked on for years might sound like a counterintuitive strategy, Meta believes open-sourcing will allow developers to discover problems with the software—ultimately leading to a better product and more influence for Meta. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, on the other hand, offer limited access to their AI tools.

Union says influencers are part of this strike, too <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uB?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> "SAG-AFTRA on Strike!" stickers all over iPhone. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uB?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
TikTok influencers will have to return to plank challenges or put down their tiny mics, because the actors strike also applies to them. On Monday, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the Hollywood union that went on strike last week, released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uC?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1436b3b1e06c> an FAQ detailing how union and nonunion creators can avoid crossing the digital picket line.

The guidelines explain that creators can fulfill any contracts that were agreed upon before the strike started and work on brand partnerships—but shouldn’t take on any new Barbie makeup tutorials. The guild also advises creators not to hype any struck work <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9u_?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c3d08f6359c>, even if they promote it as a fan.

The stakes are high: If a nonunion influencer decides to make some extra cash posting a three-hour “Easter eggs of Oppenheimer” YouTube video, they could risk never being allowed to become a member of SAG-AFTRA.

These guidelines are the first of their kind, since the last time actors walked out on major studios was in 1980 when the biggest influencer was the Morton Salt girl. But the restrictions show how the walkout is impacting the incomes of a group of performers outside of Hollywood. Influencers already play an important role in promoting films and TV shows, especially now that actors are barred from doing Hot Ones.—MM

So you won the Powerball. Now what? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ul?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Powerball lottery GIF <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ul?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Morning Brew
The Powerball will hold a drawing tonight for a jackpot worth an estimated $1 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9um?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a79301b68bf8> after no winning tickets were sold in the previous 38 drawings. If won at that amount, it’d be the third-largest Powerball prize in the lottery’s history.

Let’s get this out of the way first: You won’t win the jackpot. You just…won’t. The odds of winning are about 1-in-292 million, which means you’re far more likely to die from a meteorite strike or go to the ER because of a pogo stick injury than win the Powerball.

But let’s say you do win, because someone has to. You’ll be faced with a decision: Take a one-time lump sum of $516.8 million, or choose to be paid out in increments over 29 years in what’s called an “annuity.”

Which should you take?

Most people who win the lottery choose the lump sum, and that’s because you can make more money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9un?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=85c3672812d4> in the long run. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, you can invest your lottery winnings right away and, even with a conservative rate of return, make more over 30 years than you can with the smaller droplets of cash provided by the annuity.

That said, the lump sum may not be for everyone. Are you the type of person who bought a JPEG of a rock in 2021? If so, the annuity could offer some self-imposed fiscal discipline to prevent you from blowing all your winnings—which definitely happens. The internet is littered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9uo?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=491e3f08bf4e> with stories <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9up?mbcid=32122758.2824837&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b983f3b88364> of lottery winners who squandered their fortune or otherwise watched their lives fall apart after thinking they had made it.—NF

 ✢ A Note From Facet

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. The claim Pays For Itself is based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Fees range from $2-8k a year and may increase based on complexity of a member's financial picture.

Good morning. Taylor Swift’s music may be the only thing breaking more records than global temperatures. Swift became the first woman to have 12 No. 1 albums after her re-recorded Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) notched the top spot on the Billboard 200. With her twelfth No. 1 album, Swift passed Barbra Streisand, who has 11.

Seems like a good opportunity for a pop quiz: There are only three other musical acts with 12 or more No. 1 albums. Who are they? Give it some thought as you scroll through the newsletter, and the answer will be at the bottom.

People across the US are likely belting out  Lil Wayne when they check their bank balances these days. New data shows Americans have more cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qC?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5266fbdfcdee> sitting in the bank than they did before the pandemic.

Americans have ~10%–15% more in their bank accounts than they did in 2019,  according to a JPMorgan Chase analysis of 9 million Chase customers’ checking and savings accounts.

Meanwhile, after lagging behind inflation for two years, wages are finally rising faster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qD?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=64f708f19266> than prices. Last month, hourly wages were up 4%, while prices for consumer goods only climbed 3%.

We’re spending like we know we’ve got it: Though Americans have more funds than they did before they had an opinion on the best brand of hand sanitizer, median account balances have dipped more than 41% from their peak in April 2021, when people collected stimulus checks with nowhere to go spend them, the Chase analysis shows. And people still want to shop—consumer sentiment spiked to an almost two-year high this month.

It helps explain why the recession that Wall Street kept promising hasn’t materialized, according to the Washington Post (fingers crossed that trend continues).

The same can’t be said across the pond: According to the Wall Street Journal, Europeans are getting poorer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qE?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b93ea665b848>. Wages have declined, and the fallout from Covid and the war in Ukraine continue to be felt.

But there are payments coming due

The biggest bill many are facing is the one for their student loans, and those auto-debits are scheduled to restart in October after the Supreme Court struck down the Biden Administration’s plan to forgive much of that debt.

Other programs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qF?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ee79d284a32f> that helped people save during the pandemic are also winding down, and there’s no telling what the potential impact of future interest rate increases on the economy or the job market will be.

Bottom line: Things are looking up right now, but maybe don’t blow your whole rainy day fund on jet skis and Barbie merch just yet.—AR

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the decision would “strike a blow to people in need everywhere.” In other Russia news: Russia seized local assets of European companies Danone and Carlsberg, underscoring the risks for foreign companies staying in business there. And a Ukrainian attack damaged a bridge connecting Russia with the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Who has two electric motors and a $10,000 price cut? *Slaps roof of F-150 Lightning* this guy. Yesterday, Ford reduced the starting cost of its battery-powered pickup truck from $59,995 to $49,995, saying it was because of lower material prices and greater production capabilities.

It’s likely also because over the weekend, Tesla began building its long-awaited Cybertruck, which will directly rival <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qK?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e20e4c0625f8> the F-150 Lightning and is estimated by Kelley Blue Book to start at around $50,000. While Ford has slashed the price tag on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV several times to try and compete with Tesla, whose own cuts have helped it dominate 60% of the fluctuating American EV market, it had been raising prices on the F-150 Lightning…until now.

With sales of the F-150 Lightning dropping from 13,000 in the second half of 2022 to 8,800 in the first half of 2023, Ford is hoping the price cut will juice sales. But there’s still an oversupply of the reduced cost Mach-E that far outpaces demand.

Ford isn’t alone: The quantity of EVs available for purchase in the US has exploded by almost 350% this year, according to Cox Automotive, and demand hasn’t kept pace—leaving many unsold cars on lots.—ML

One of the internet’s favorite travel hacks made headlines recently after a teen allegedly got detained <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9qu?mbcid=32108871.2815710&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8a62392d721f> and barred from boarding an American Airlines flight because his North Carolina driver’s license aroused suspicion.

The passenger wasn’t suspected of smuggling Cook Out: His trip to NYC had a layover in Charlotte, NC, and airline staff (correctly) supposed he was committing a textbook example of skiplagging, the thrifty trick of booking a flight with a stopover with no intention of proceeding to the final destination.

Why skip out on the final city? Airlines usually charge more for direct flights than ones with layovers, so booking this way can save you a lot on the fare.

But missing out on the extra cash makes carriers side eye the practice like you would a seatmate keen on unpacking the trauma of his three divorces with you.

That means it’s not just the LeBrons of the world who are out there being both literally and figuratively baller: The WSJ highlighted the deal recently offered by the Pacers worth up to $45 million to Bruce Brown, a player who started last season on the bench before quietly helping his Denver Nuggets teammates clinch the championship.

The Dutch entrepreneur who is contracted to manage Mali’s domain has been sounding the alarm about this leak potential for a decade, but his contract is almost up, meaning all emails will soon go straight to Mali’s government, which is closely allied with Russia.

The DeSantis campaign is burning through cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mP?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mP?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Joe Raedle/Getty Images
This weekend, we got the first detailed look <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mQ?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=884f473a07e0> at the finances of 2024 presidential candidates, and here’s the biggest takeaway: Ron DeSantis is burning through money like he’s Adam Neumann in 2017. Regulatory filings show that DeSantis’s finances desperately need replenishment if he wants to make up ground against former President Trump, who he’s trailing far behind in the polls for the Republican nomination.

The numbers: The Florida governor raised an impressive $20 million in the second quarter but has spent about 40% of the amount he raised.

One of the biggest reasons for the cash burn is that the DeSantis campaign hired like a tech company that thought Covid would last forever. The DeSantis team had 92 full-time employees on payroll (by far the biggest staff of any GOP candidate) before reportedly firing about a dozen last week to reduce expenses.

And generating revenue will also be a challenge for DeSantis because many of his donors are tapped out: More than two-thirds of his cash on hand is from backers who gave $3,300, which is the biggest check individuals can write in primary elections.

How do the other contenders stack up?

While Trump, the front-runner, raised less than DeSantis last quarter ($17.7 million), he’s still got twice as much to spend.

President Biden’s operation looks downright bootstrapped. His reelection campaign spent just $1.1 million in the second quarter and employs just four full-time staff. At this point in Obama’s reelection campaign in 2011, he had spent $11 million, per CNN. This lack of spending, plus a meager haul <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mR?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cb4eebffb873> from smaller donors, is raising some concern in Democrat circles.

Lesser-known candidates are getting creative

When you’re a newcomer to national politics and don’t have a sprawling campaign machine, you’ve got to get scrappy to raise money.

Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, is handing out commissions to turn his supporters into salespeople. A program he launched last week will give his backers a 10% cut <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mS?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ba3870dee2f6> of the money they raise for his campaign.

Another GOP candidate, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, is leveraging his city’s newest asset: He’s raffling off front-row tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mT?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=701a6d7d4115> to Lionel Messi’s first game at Inter Miami to his financial supporters.

Finally, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is simply handing out cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mU?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3ed78cf694a7> ($20 in gift cards, to be precise) to anyone who donates as little as $1 to his campaign. Burgum needs to hit a 40,000-donor target to qualify for the first GOP debate next month, but it’s unclear whether this scheme is legal.

Alcaraz topples Djokovic in London. The heir apparent of men’s tennis, 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, defeated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mY?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f326a9c74d6> Novak Djokovic in a five-set epic for his first Wimbledon title (probably the first of many). With his victory, Alcaraz denied a dominant Djokovic a fifth-straight Wimbledon trophy and his 24th major championship overall. “I haven’t played a player like him ever, to be honest,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz. On the women’s side, Marketa Vondrousova became the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon.

As downpours drenched the Northeast and canceled flights, a record-breaking heat wave peaked in the US South and West, but temps will remain sizzling throughout this week. In Southern Europe, a dangerous “heat storm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m-?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0687c5140766>” forced the Acropolis in Athens to close for a second day, and over a dozen Italian cities issued heat advisories.

Call of Duty will remain on PlayStation.

It’s a long-promised move by Microsoft to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, across the finish line by tomorrow’s deadline (regulators were worried that Microsoft would make Activision content exclusive to Xbox). All Microsoft needs now to close the deal is the blessing of regulators in the UK.

When you step into a Publix, you always witness greatness, but that became even more apparent last week when soccer legend Lionel Messi was spotted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9n1?mbcid=32099011.3180227&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a981e447bf4b> at the South Florida grocery store picking up household staples.

These intergalactic snapshots will make you gasp. Happy first anniversary to the James Webb Space Telescope starting its job. NASA celebrated this week by releasing a new image of a star birth that’s so aesthetically pleasing, you’d think it was AI-generated. The colorful close-up showcases the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, a glowing, swirling collection of 50 young stars that are similar in mass to Earth’s sun—hinting at what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy. JWST is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and since last July, it has sent back dozens of snapshots of the cosmos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lc?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4858f6b02d98> to remind us just how small we really are.

🪺When life gives you spikes, make nests. Crows and magpies living in urban parts of Belgium and the Netherlands are flipping the bird at anti-bird infrastructure. The inventive avians have been ripping out the metal spikes attached to building ledges and repurposing them as construction material. Urban-dwelling birds have been observed incorporating metals, and even barbed wire and syringes, into their abodes before, but one biologist described these spiky tree homes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ld?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=adfd3dee1b74> as “the craziest bird nests” he’s ever seen. And the magpies seem to have taken it a step further: They’re using the spikes to make prickly roofs on their nests, which might serve as a predator defense.

The hills are alive with the sound of silence. If a tree doesn’t fall in the woods, new research suggests that we’d still consider its lack of sound to be…a sound. A Johns Hopkins study has found that people hear silence as a kind of sound rather than an absence of noise. Researchers discovered this by running “sonic illusions,” which typically compare one moment of noise to two shorter moments of noise that together last the same amount of time. Listeners tend to wrongly perceive the uninterrupted moment as lasting longer, and the same thing happened when the single moment of noise was subbed out for silence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9le?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6361738ba12b>.

With some downtowns looking like ghost towns as many workers stay remote, city leaders nationwide want to turn fallow conference rooms into living quarters as an inventive fix. And there are plenty to work with: National office vacancies are at a persistent high of 19.2% (compared to 12.6% in early 2020), according to Cushman & Wakefield. McKinsey predicts that remote work will erase $800 billion from urban office real estate values.

Boston is down with it, being the revolutionary place it is: The city is testing an incentive program <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lg?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=98808c66d56a> for developers to convert empty downtown offices into housing. Mayor Michelle Wu announced this week that the owners of repurposed buildings could get a wicked deal—up to 75% off on their property taxes.

New York Mayor Eric Adams is also proposing incentives to unlock 136 million square feet of office space for residential development, and Seattle held a competition to solicit conversion ideas with cash prizes of $10,000 and $7,500 offered for the top solutions.

Office-to-home advocates say the process will…

* Help drive foot traffic to downtown businesses struggling from a lack of commuters.

* Bolster municipal coffers, as cities often rely on property taxes from office buildings. This revenue would ensure funding for services that make cities attractive places to live and work, like transportation and public safety.

* Supply much-needed housing amid a shortage that has many urbanites paying exorbitant rents and clicking on Zillow’s “buy” tab for daydreaming purposes only.

It’s worked before: A 1995 tax break for conversions helped create 13,000 new apartment units in Lower Manhattan, per the Citizens Budget Commission.

But living in an office probably won’t go mainstream

Making an office tower liveable is much harder than simply bulldozing cubicles and installing bathtubs in the bathrooms due to restrictive zoning and cumbersome regulations. Making Lower Manhattan residential again in the ’90s mostly involved converting prewar buildings that more closely resembled typical apartment buildings.

Modern offices, however, aren’t known for having natural lighting, which the best homes tend to have. Developers converting JP Morgan’s old NYC office <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lh?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0f8fa1af4892> into 1,300 apartments plan to create two sunlight-filled courtyards to keep the new pads from resembling dungeons. Slimmer office towers with less shadowy floor space tend to be easier to repurpose, the national director for office analytics at CoStar Group, Phil Mobley, told Morning Brew.

Some urban experts caution that office-to-home conversions are as comprehensive a remedy for urban planning woes as e-scooters are for transit issues. Since few office buildings are truly suited for conversion, it’s often more straightforward for developers to knock down the existing building and erect condos from scratch. As such, the conversion process is likely to supply only a small portion of the residential square footage that cities need, according <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9li?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ed1cbc480a12> to analysis from the Brookings Institution think tank.

The researchers note that humans tend to require more than a cubicle’s worth of living space, so less people can reside in an office than work in it. That means focusing on condos exclusively might not be the best way to make downtowns vibrant. They suggest that cities also consider filling unused office space with crowd magnets like restaurants, nightclubs, and academic facilities. Brookings argues for relaxed zoning and financial incentives for new housing construction to boost housing supply.

Looking ahead…it’s unclear how long offices will remain empty and available to convert: The amount of newly leased space ticked up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9lj?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f47e426c016> last quarter—a sign that talk of an office apocalypse might be premature.—SK

  Place to be: ‘The greatest outdoor show on Earth’ <#> Brody Cress from Hillsdale, Wyoming rides Friday Glory during the Saddle Broinc Championship at the Calgary Stampede Leah Hennel/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

For 10 days in July, Calgary in Alberta, Canada, hosts a massive party celebrating the Western way of life called the Calgary Stampede, an exhibition/rodeo/festival trifecta commonly known as “The greatest outdoor show on Earth.”

This summer’s event wraps up today, but if you enjoy dressing like you’re in the cast of Yellowstone, observing large domesticated animals, drinking beer, and gorging yourself on pancakes, you might want to book your ticket to next year’s Stampede now.

Did we mention the pancakes? They’re a pretty big deal. Free pancake breakfasts have been handed out at the Stampede since 1923, when the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede merged to lay the foundation for the event as it’s known today.

And on the 100th anniversary of the pancake breakfasts this year, Calgary turned up. Organizers handed out 17,182 pancakes during an eight-hour period, which broke the Guinness World Record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ln?mbcid=32085607.3197275&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6eb62659151c> (even though 15 pancakes were ultimately disqualified).

The Stampede isn’t without controversy. Animal rights activists have protested the rodeo events, particularly the popular chuckwagon races, which have led to horse deaths.

Those concerns haven’t deterred crowds of wannabe cowboys from descending on Calgary. In 2019, a record 1.28 million visitors attended the Stampede over the 10 days, and this year’s attendance could be the highest yet.—NF

Good morning. The jackpot for tonight’s Powerball drawing has surged to an estimated $875 million—the third-highest jackpot in the game’s history.

To give you a sense of how much money you are not going to win, New Jersey authorities ran the math: If you had enough dollar bills to represent the combined Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots ($1.435 billion) and laid them out on the New Jersey Turnpike side by side across the entire length of the highway…you’d cover it and still have a lot of cash left over. An absolutely useless piece of trivia: Only $1,382,211,601 in dollar bills can fit onto the surface of the Turnpike.

Markets: Wall Street traders went hard yesterday before heading off to their beach houses, pushing the Dow to its best week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m2?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc8cfcd985bc> since March on the news that America’s biggest banks have it made in the shade (more on that in a sec). But it wasn’t all sunshine and surf dreams: The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both dipped, and AT&T sank to its lowest in 29 years after an analyst questioned the potential for slowing growth at the telecom and possible liabilities from its use of lead cables.

 

FINANCE

The biggest banks are making bank <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m3?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A Gif from Workaholics that says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m3?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Workaholics/Comedy Central via Giphy
Banking heavyweights are rolling in it: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m4?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0746604f69cb> expectations-defying quarterly profits yesterday. The financial health of the biggest money houses is closely linked to that of the wider US economy, so let’s all pat ourselves on the back for their success.

Besides signaling that the economy is going strong despite interest rate hikes putting a damper on commercial activity and consumer spending, the big banks’ banner quarter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m5?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=83f3b1708ed5> also reflects how well larger lenders have weathered the banking crisis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9m6?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=501529267e62> that claimed three regional banks earlier this year.

Where are the banks raking it in from?

All those Fed rate hikes. They mean the banks can charge clients higher rates for loans. The income from interest on loans at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup combined grew by 31% compared to last year, per the Wall Street Journal.

And the biggest of the big, JPMorgan, has benefited from the industry turmoil that’s been hurting small banks. It reported its highest quarterly profit ever, 67% higher than Q2 last year, thanks in large part to its purchase of collapsed First Republic Bank (along with its affluent client accounts and massive loan portfolio) after regulators took it over in May.

But there are some signs of trouble ahead….

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo gave out less money in home loans compared with last year, and they’ve seen slightly more defaults on credit card debt. And Wells Fargo has put aside more money to cover for potential losses on commercial real-estate loans.

Citigroup’s profit declined 36% from last year as its investment business slowed down, with the recent debt ceiling fight in Congress partially to blame.

And the future of the economy is still anyone’s guess: Of inflation’s recent decline, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN, “I don’t know if it’s going to lead to a soft landing, a mild recession, or a hard recession.” It’s a good reminder that he is not actually a prophet.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> President Joe Biden Win Mcnamee/Getty Images
The Biden administration will wipe out $39 billion of student debt. Yesterday, the  Department of Education announced a rule tweak <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ma?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5ee3cc37d981> that will cancel debt for 804,000 borrowers. The change will impact borrowers who enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, counting more payments toward the forgiveness that is available to them after 20 or 25 years worth of payments are made. The update comes after President Biden vowed to find other ways to provide relief when his plan to forgive $400 billion in federal student loan debt got nixed by the Supreme Court last month.

Authorities think they finally caught the Gilgo Beach serial killer. More than a decade after young women’s bodies began turning up on a remote stretch of Long Island, a suspect has been apprehended <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mb?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=60b60800bdba> and charged. Local architect Rex Heuermann pleaded not guilty yesterday to the murders of three out of 11 people whose killings inspired the 2020 Netflix film Lost Girls. Law enforcement says they’ve matched Heuermann’s DNA to materials found on the victims’ remains and that he’s the prime suspect in a fourth Gilgo killing, too. Heuermann is being held without bail and will have his next court appearance on August 1.

There’s been no shortage of record-high temperatures around the globe recently, and since “space fan” isn't something NASA is currently working on, other scientists are picking up the slack to cool buildings down.

Some options:

Going underground. Geothermal heat pumps <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9md?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b32058e6445e> don’t use natural gas to cool and heat your home. Instead pipes buried hundreds of feet beneath your yard send water underground that circulates back cooler due to temperature differences below the surface. It’s got big advantages over traditional air conditioning and heating because it uses far less electricity and is cheaper in the long run. It’s typically more expensive upfront, but a 30% tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act could change that.

The whitest paint in the world. We’re talking paint so white it would share a sandwich with its dog. A team of scientists at Purdue University created <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9me?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ffc061f00cda> a white paint that reflects 98% of sunlight (most white paints only reflect 80%–90%). It won’t be ready for commercial use for at least a year, but it promises to decrease the need for air conditioning inside a building by about 40%.

Big picture: Developers of these technologies know paint and underground tubes are just a Band-Aid for a planet currently getting cooked. Stay safe if you’re one of the 90 million people in the US under heat alerts this weekend.—MM

Launching a product? Consider getting a tattoo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mi?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Entrepreneurs with tattoos could get more crowdfunding, says a new study. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mi?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo Collage: Getty Images/Cameron Abbas
Forget what your parents told you: Those tattoos that they said would hurt your professional future could actually help you rake in more money for your business.

On the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, product campaigns with photos of inked-up people receive significantly more backers and contributions than the campaigns that just show a bunch of normies, according to a new study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mj?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=baab2ad5748a>.

Featuring tats is especially beneficial for nonartsy products, like smart glasses or other tech, because research shows it signals unexpected creativity to backers that makes them more inclined to donate.

Nonartistic products receive 458 more backers and $27,000 more in funding, on average, when entrepreneurs chose to feature body art—whether on themselves or models—in campaign photos.

Artistic campaigns showing some ink only drew an average of 128 more backers, possibly because they’re already seen as creative.

But…while tattoos help propel crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter—where most of the backers are under 35 and likely to be chill with body art or have some of their own—your parents might still be right about keeping your ink covered around traditional investors. “You won’t see Warren Buffett rolling up his sleeves and showing tattoos,” one researcher told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mk?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=077f198654c3> the Wall Street Journal.—ML

Stat: If you’ve been daydreaming about how sweet it would be to have your private jet touch down in Sun Valley or what you’d eat at Kristen Bell’s dinner party, know that according to a new study by SmartAsset, you need to make more than $650,000 a year to rank among the wealthiest 1% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mo?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=47261ae0efbf> of US households. And in some states, it takes even more income to run with the summer-is-a-verb crowd: In Connecticut, where you need the most cash to get out of the 99%, it requires raking in $953,000 annually—before taxes.

Quote: “Aspartame is one of the most studied food additives in the human food supply. FDA scientists do not have safety concerns when aspartame is used under the approved conditions.”

Pop open an ice-cold Diet Coke because the FDA has proclaimed that it is officially not on board <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9mp?mbcid=32088620.2799075&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c7d8833f74e5> with the WHO’s finding that the artificial sweetener it uses (as do ~6,000 other products) may cause cancer. The FDA said it had reviewed the studies the WHO used to determine that aspartame is a carcinogen and found “significant shortcomings.” It also noted that the WHO hadn’t changed the acceptable daily intake for the sweetener. So, even if the FDA doesn’t have you convinced that there’s nothing to see here, you’re likely safely below the limit.

Good morning. Earlier this week a story spread across the internet (including in Monday’s Brew) that people in 17 states would be treated to a northern lights display today.

Unfortunately, that forecast was never true, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which was cited as the source of the forecast.

For most of us, tonight’s sky will be the same as it always is: dark and full of terrors.

It’s official: 160,000 actors, announcers, game show hosts, and even the people who pretend to be Harrison Ford tucking and rolling through booby-trapped temples are going on strike. Their union, SAG-AFTRA, did not reach a deal with the studios, meaning they will join the already striking Writers Guild of America (WGA) on the picket line.

It’s the first time writers and actors have been on strike together since 1960, but both groups are now seeking better pay as streaming transforms the entertainment industry landscape, as well as assurances that studios aren’t going to replace them with AI.

So, what happens now?

The WGA strike, now in its third month, has already shuttered most film and TV production in New York, LA, and even Chicago, and with the actors joining in, the few projects that were proceeding with already written scripts will now shut down. Plus, the SAG-AFTRA strike now keeps members from filming projects overseas, too, so the highly anticipated House of the Dragon and part two of Mission: Impossible –Dead Reckoning will have to halt filming.

SAG-AFTRA strike rules also bar actors from participating in promotional activities <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9eZ?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f06fef274611>. So, premieres like the one for Disney’s Haunted Mansion won’t be star-studded, and Margot Robbie’s pink carpet couture is going back in the Barbie trunk.

And hopefully the Emmys didn’t already print invites: Even though we all tweeted our congrats to Jennifer Coolidge on her nomination yesterday, the people in charge will likely push the ceremony from September to January to avoid having a show with no famous people.

Tour de headlines <#> Bob Iger on Fox Business Network's Michael Loccisano/Getty Images
Bob Iger plans to stay at the House of Mouse for a while. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who returned to the role to replace Bob Chapek in November, has agreed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fy?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d9d9f87e9f6a> to lead the company through 2026—two years longer than originally planned. Iger has already begun a restructuring that included laying off 7,000 employees as the company contends with the transition to streaming, dwindling park attendance, and a feud with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The extension will give Disney extra time to pick a successor to take the reins once Iger steps down.

It’s getting hotter in the water. Ocean temperatures <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f2?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=92daebc5891e> off the coast of Florida have climbed to unprecedented highs of nearly 97 degrees Fahrenheit, when readings in the 80s would be more typical. The temps are so high that they’re off the color scale of some weather maps, according to the Washington Post. The Jacuzzi-like temperatures pose a major danger to the coral in the area, which is likely to bleach (meaning turn white from starvation)—especially since it’s only July and corals usually suffer most from the heat in August and September.

Fox News got hit with another defamation suit. Tucker Carlson may be broadcasting on Twitter now, but he’s still causing headaches for his former employer. Trump supporter Ray Epps sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fz?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c4a67d67976d> the network, claiming the bow-tied host pushed the “fantastical story” on Fox that Epps was an undercover FBI agent who instigated the violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, rather than being a regular protester. Of course, it was the fallout from Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against Fox, which the network settled for $787.5 million, that got Carlson booted from the network in April.

ECONOMY

Inflation, unlike the climate, is cooling down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f3?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Stack of money frozen in ice cube <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f3?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Get ready to make hella frittatas because it looks like the days of $14 eggs are behind us. Inflation cooled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f4?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7ede69b7c5cb> to a two-year low of 3% last month, according to government data released yesterday—meaning the worst of the crisis is probably over.

Core inflation (which takes out volatile food and energy prices) rose only 0.2% in June—its slowest pace since early 2021.

Not all prices are coming down, though. According to the Wall Street Journal’s deep dive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f5?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0806a2dbb671> into the data, there are still some things to avoid buying if you want to hang on to your cash:

Don’t: Burn your toast, chug Diet Coke, or eat frozen peas. The price of white bread increased 11.5% over the past year, carbonated drinks went up 9.1%, and frozen vegetables jumped 17.6%.

Do: Go on a road trip, buy a 55-inch LCD, and attend a destination wedding. Gas is down 27%, TVs prices decreased 10%, and airline fares dropped 19%.

Big picture: It looks like the Fed’s string of interest rate hikes have done their job. But inflation remains above the 2% target, so JPow and friends are expected to raise rates later this month. Experts say it’ll likely be the last increase for a while.—CC

The world’s biggest cruise ship is coming soon, and it would probably send a Victorian child into a coma.

Longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall, Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas is a Pimp My Ride fever dream <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fa?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=13e4b651e90e> that just passed its first sea trials. It’s got twenty decks, more than 40 venues for wining and dining, an ice rink, a 55-foot waterfall, nine whirlpools, and an open-air “Central Park” with real foliage.

The new ship is five times larger than the Titanic, and while some people (and orcas <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/70t?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aaaf91eda14e>, if they could Tweet) are calling it a dystopian monstrosity <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9fb?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1dfe8c0c157b>, plenty of eager cruisers have already booked passage on the big ship.

Royal Caribbean had its largest-ever booking day when Icon tickets, which started at $1,537, dropped last October.

All 5,610 passenger spots on the Icon’s inaugural January 2024 voyage from Miami to the Caribbean are sold out. But more seven-night trips later in the year are still available, and those looking to hit the candy-colored waterslides like a baller can spring for a suite at ~$10,864 per person.

Zoom out: After suffering a 15-month pandemic shutdown, cruises have come back even bigger. Next year, 36 million people are expected to vacation at sea, compared to 29.7 million in 2019, according to the Cruise Line International Association.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> A half pink, half muted ticket Francis Scialabba
Stat: Moviegoers will soon be coming to AMC for twice the magic: Barbenheimer—a double feature of the upcoming films Barbie and Oppenheimer—has moved from internet obsession to driver of actual ticket sales. More than 20,000 people have already ordered tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9ff?mbcid=32064361.2834678&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d67e4fd25c4a> from the theater chain to experience the peanut-butter-and-pickles-like pairing of a movie about a doll discovering the world outside her hot-pink Dreamhouse and another about the creation of the atomic bomb. And the meme-turned-IRL five-hour commitment isn’t just a US phenomenon: UK cinema chain Vue told Bloomberg that 19% percent of Oppenheimer ticket buyers also purchased Barbie tickets.

Good morning. If you see people walking around this evening looking like they don’t have a purpose in life, they’re probably sports fans. Today, the day after the MLB All-Star Game, is considered the slowest sports day of the year, with none of the Big Four North American leagues holding competitive games.

But there are still sports on, and we’re especially pumped for this morning’s Wimbledon quarterfinal match featuring the American underdog, Christopher Eubanks, against world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev. No one expected Eubanks to reach this point in the tournament—not even himself. He’s extended his hotel reservation in London three times already.

Let’s send it back to fourth grade real quick: Scientists divide the geological history of the Earth into stages, such as epochs, periods, and eras, which are defined by fundamental shifts in the natural world.

For the last 11,700 years, we’ve been living in the Holocene epoch. But a group of renegade scientists argues that a new epoch began in the mid-20th century: the Anthropocene <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cJ?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4d489c1b0908>.

Those scientists, who make up the Anthropocene Working Group, advanced their claims in a big way yesterday by selecting a “golden spike,” or one physical spot that marks an epoch, for the proposed Anthropocene: Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada.

What is the Anthropocene? It’s the first epoch defined by humans rather than Mother Nature, and it reflects the (harmful) impact that Homo sapiens have had on the Earth. Scientists chose Crawford Lake because “it contained the clearest and most pronounced evidence of humankind’s influence on the global geologic record,” per the New York Times.

The most significant change in the lake’s sediment is a sharp increase in radioactive plutonium around 1950.

The lake’s mud also reveals heightened levels of ash and nitrogen, reflecting pollution from fossil fuels.

But the Anthropocene is still in review

Scientists are conflicted about whether the Anthropocene should be labeled a new epoch in Earth’s geological history.

Opponents argue that the period of human influence, however significant, is just a blip in the history of the world. Most epochs span at least a few million years; the Anthropocene would be just ~70 years old.

But that’s why other scientists say it should be formally codified. Humans have made outsized changes to the Earth in the relatively infinitesimal amount of time we’ve spent on the planet. Many experts believe that marking that impact in history books could inspire an attitude shift in the struggle to mitigate climate change.

Looking ahead…in the coming years, two big-name international scientific bodies—the International Commission on Stratigraphy and the International Union of Geological Sciences—will decide if the Anthropocene should be considered an official epoch. But the decision is going to be contentious: The battle over the Anthropocene has already caused a split within the scientific community, and some members of the Anthropocene Working Group have resigned due to contrasting opinions.—CC

Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard cleared for landing. A federal judge rejected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cN?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3be309a908b7> the FTC’s attempt to stop Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, paving the way for the $69 billion deal to close as soon as this month. The FTC argued that the takeover would result in less competition in the video game industry and limit access to Activision’s blockbuster games, but the judge disagreed, saying, “To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.” While the deal still needs UK regulators’ approval, they also signaled yesterday they would let it proceed.

Bank of America slapped with $250 million in fines for “junk fees.” Regulators penalized the US’ second-biggest bank for a series of consumer abuses <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cO?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d8ed055e39ee>, including opening credit card accounts without consent, charging overdraft fees twice, and improperly withholding credit card rewards. The fines are part of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) war against junk fees—e.g., overdraft charges—that added hundreds of millions of dollars to Bank of America’s top line between 2018 and 2022. Last year, Wells Fargo reached a $3.7 billion settlement with the CFBP over junk fees.

PGA Tour officials said a merger with LIV was the only option.

Sympathetic Republican Sen. Ron Johnson pointed out that LIV has 500x the financial resources as the PGA Tour, but Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized the PGA Tour for compromising its values for money. The DOJ is investigating the PGA–LIV deal over antitrust concerns, Blumenthal said.

Local officials feared that an upstream dam within a few feet of overflowing could dump even more floodwater onto city streets.

We’ve spent so much time making Barbenheimer jokes that we’ve missed the real theatrical main character this summer: IMAX screens.

Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters today, and usually a Tom Cruise action film would dominate the sprawling screens. But Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb movie, Oppenheimer, will be evicting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9cZ?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa630779efcd> Mission: Impossible from IMAX earlier than Cruise would like.

Mission: Impossible will have just nine days on IMAX screens before the Nolan flick that is supposed to devastate all of us opens on July 21. Oppenheimer will then occupy every IMAX theater in North America for three whole weeks, a week longer than similar big-screen deals.

Cruise is mad about getting evicted.

But it’s not about the money. If it were, Mission: Impossible would win. The movie is expected to easily double Oppenheimer’s first weekend of box-office sales. Instead, it’s about rewarding a diehard fan. The CEO of IMAX told Variety, “Nolan has a special place in IMAX’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us.”—MM

As a shortage of Huy Fong’s famous sauce enters its second year, resellers on sites like Amazon and eBay are hawking Sriracha for up to 10x <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d2?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1df0958e9df4> the original price, USA Today reports. And people are buying it—one 12-pack went for $415, or $34.58 per bottle, while another seller thinks they can nab $80 for a single container. The shortage, which stems from a bad crop of the chili peppers used to make the sauce, shows no signs of easing, and that’s devastating news because the knockoff Trader Joe’s version just isn’t cutting it.

Quote: “Of course, it’s unfortunate. This is perfectly good milk.”

There may not be enough Sriracha, but there’s too much milk. John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, lamented how dairy farms across the Upper Midwest are spilling milk into the sewers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d3?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bc7c0cadd4ee> because they have nowhere to send the perishable liquid. US milk production is at a record high, but demand isn’t keeping up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9d4?mbcid=32052562.96700&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26d16f3fa015>: Kids are drinking less milk since they’re out of school, and plants processing milk into cheese are at capacity.

 ✳︎ A Note From Facet

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities.

We all have a friend who’s never in a rush to fulfill our gentle post-night-out Venmo request, and once they do pay, it takes another few days for the money to travel from the app to your bank account. While your flaky friend might be incorrigible, the second part of the wait could soon become a thing of the past: The Fed is launching <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/98_?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8d693f6c1736> its FedNow instant payment service later this month.

The new system will enable banks to send each other cash instantly, 24/7, as an alternative to the existing system that runs only during normal business hours and often takes days to move money.

This puts America’s banking system on track to catch up to countries like India and Nigeria, where high-speed payments are as common as high-speed rail in Japan. The US does already have an instant payments system, but it’s private rather than government-backed, and it hasn’t been widely adopted. It’s mostly only used by big banks, and only 1.4% of US transactions happen in real time, according to ACI Worldwide, a payment systems company.

FedNow-enabled services will likely appear at 41 banks that have so far said they’ll participate, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.

People moving money between banks or paying bills could complete their transactions in seconds, without the need to plan payments days in advance.

Businesses will be able to access customer payments immediately and they could send workers payments more frequently with instant direct deposit rather than the usual payroll cycle.

Faster payments could mean faster bank runs

Some experts worry that giving people the ability to drain their bank accounts instantaneously could make SVB-style <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/990?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=75e26de9b056> bank runs more likely.

Smaller banks struggling with liquidity would have even less time to react to customer panic and get collateral for emergency government loans to cover fleeing cash.

But there are safeguards built in. FedNow has a $500,000 transaction limit, and banks can set their own ceilings to ensure that customers don’t pull their deposits faster than they can say “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.”—SK

Floods in the Northeast threaten lives and destroy roads. Around 9 million people were under flood warnings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/994?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a9fb72fa6a3f> yesterday and some areas experienced once-in-a-millennium levels of rainfall as storms that began on Sunday pummeled the Northeastern US. New York’s Hudson Valley, where at least one person died in the storm, and Vermont, where flash flood risks were high and rain fell at a rate of 1.5 inches per hour, were hit especially hard. Thousands of flights were canceled and delayed, and major roads were damaged and even washed away.

Turkey to roll out the NATO welcome mat for Sweden at last.

Though there are still steps left before Sweden officially becomes a NATO member, with that issue largely resolved the talk of today’s big NATO summit in Lithuania is likely to be about how to handle another country that’s eager to join: Ukrain Ozempic and another weight-loss drug investigated for suicide risk. The EU’s drug regulator has opened a probe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/996?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=886b00ec945f> into reports that Novo Nordisk’s drugs Ozempic and Saxenda, and others containing semaglutide or liraglutide, are linked to thoughts of suicide and self-harm based on three incidents from Iceland. The agency may also decide to consider other drugs in the same class, which are among the most popular in the world and are also made by other pharma companies. In the US, Wegovy (another Novo semaglutide-based medicine) already carries a warning for suicidal behavior—even though clinical trials of the drug did not find it elevated the risk—because other weight-loss drugs did pose the risk, according to Bloomberg.

Say a little prayer for Aretha Franklin’s sons <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99c?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99c?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Aretha Franklin's sons have taken the fight over her estate to court.
The children of the Queen of Soul are duking it out in court to see who will take control of the late singer’s multimillion-dollar estate.

Aretha Franklin did not leave behind a formal, typed-out will, but two handwritten versions were discovered in her home after her death in 2018. Yesterday, a trial <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99d?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6813baf561e> began in Michigan where lawyers for two of the singer’s four sons will argue that a 2014 handwritten note—signed with a smiley face and stuffed in a sofa—counts as her last will and testament. Another son favors a contradictory, notarized 2010 version.

Both documents appear to split Franklin’s royalties among her children and require that the three competing brothers support her fourth son, who has a disability.

But the wills differ on who gets her personal property and on who takes charge of the estate.

Kecalf and Edward Franklin are vying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/99e?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a04158d861a1> for the 2014 document, which names Kecalf as executor and leaves him with his mother’s house, cars, jewelry, and the fur coats she’d famously let slide off her shoulders onstage. Franklin’s third son, Ted White II, favors the 2010 will that names him as executor and bars Kecalf and Edward from their inheritances until they get business degrees or certificates.—ML

Turns out that watching Hilary Farr call a perfectly normal living room “cringe” is not good for your relationship with your home.

A new study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/998?mbcid=32040136.2779585&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=581bd54c9d54> from the Journal of Consumer Research found home renovation media is responsible for a shift toward standardization, according to analysis from the Washington Post.

Meet the “market-reflected gaze.” That’s what the study dubbed the internalized idea that a future homebuyer can (and will) judge your decorating choices. In an effort to maintain the value of their home, people are ignoring their own preferred design choices in favor of mainstream elements like neutral finishes, stainless-steel appliances, and Pinterest-popular decor.

That beige open-living floor plan might be good when it’s time to sell, it’s arguably bad for your soul: Some of the study’s 17 participants said that they wished they put more personalization into their home, with one likening her own bathroom to one in a hotel room.

Bottom line: Design really does impact resale value. Even if you hate charcoal-gray kitchens, you should have one—it could increase the value of your home by $2,512, per a Zillow analysis.—CC

If you missed the tweet, it’s probably because you were over on Threads with everyone else, seeing what your favorite potato chip brand had to say. Meta’s Twitter clone hit 100 million users just five days after its launch, taking the crown for the fastest-growing platform ever from ChatGPT . Similarweb’s data shows Twitter’s traffic down 5% for the two days after the wide release of Threads, per CNBC. But it’s still got a ways to go to catch Twitter, which has ~250 million users arguing with one another.

Good morning. Elton John has performed “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” in concerts 1,475 times over the past 50 years, according to Setlist.fm, but he might have sung it for the final time Saturday night when he closed out his marathon tour in Sweden. John’s farewell tour, which began in 2018 and spanned 333 shows, is the highest grossing tour ever, bringing in more than $900 million.

The record may not stand for long. Taylor Swift’s and Beyoncé’s ongoing stadium-bursting tours could each bring in more than $1 billion, and Beyoncé only just arrived in North America this weekend with shows in Toronto.

Did you know you can disable a Waymo or Cruise robotaxi by placing an orange traffic cone on its hood?

A group of activists in San Francisco found out you can, and they’re using the tactic to protest driverless taxis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95J?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e76acef1e8fa> taking over their city’s streets. The group, which calls itself Safe Street Rebel, has been putting traffic cones on robotaxis’ hoods to stop them from operating and has been giving instructions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95K?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0223e337c24> on social media to encourage others to make their own immobile orange unicorns.

The anti-robotaxi vigilantism comes ahead of a major hearing this week that could allow Cruise and Waymo, two autonomous vehicle companies with robotaxi services in SF, to expand their operations in the city to a level comparable to Uber’s and Lyft’s.

Why the pushback?

As regulations on Waymo and Cruise have slowly lifted, they’ve become a “ubiquitous presence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95L?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c51f056b457>” in San Francisco, the Washington Post reports. But without a human at the wheel, these cars have gotten into situations perfect for the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme music—for example, a swarm of them stopped moving <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95M?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e05ea321ec8e> at an intersection last summer, blocking traffic for hours.

But frustrated people in San Francisco say they didn’t sign up to be guinea pigs in Big Tech’s experiments. And safety leaders are sounding off: The city’s fire chief, Jeanine Nicholson, told MarketWatch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95N?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d9afcd58a42e> that malfunctioning robotaxis have blocked first responders from getting where they need to go, and in the case of a growing fire, every second matters. “They are not ready for prime time,” Nicholson said of the autonomous vehicles.

The coneheads have been called “anti-progress”

Robotaxi companies and proponents of driverless cars say these hiccups are just the growing pains of a complex technology that will ultimately save many lives. Human drivers are incredibly lethal, after all, and a robot never needs to check their texts while driving. Accessibility advocates, economic development organizations, and elected officials are in Waymo’s and Cruise’s corner, so the robotaxi expansion is expected to pass at the hearing later this week.

Looking ahead…proving that robotaxis can successfully navigate SF’s hilly and winding roads would be a big step for Waymo and Cruise as they aim to bring driverless services to other US cities.

The NBA announces an in-season tournament. NBA teams floundering in the league’s regular season will still have a shot at a trophy: Commissioner Adam Silver said the NBA will stage its first in-season tournament <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95R?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0cc79c4e9599> in November and December, with teams competing in a group stage for a chance to play in a “Final Four”-style round in Las Vegas. Silver said the new tradition was inspired by European soccer, which hosts several concurrent tournaments throughout the year, such as the Champions League. Also in the NBA, No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama showed he has some things to learn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95S?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3dcc95f7b24e> in his Summer League debut for the Spurs.

The US has a toxic lead cable problem. The US has more than 2,000 cables covered in toxic lead that present a health hazard and have gone unaddressed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95T?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7635a1500d2> by the telecom companies that laid them, a WSJ investigation found. Over decades, lead on these pipes has degraded into the soil and water in populated areas, including where kids go to school and people fish. No amount of contact with lead is safe, doctors say, which is why the US has elliminated the metal from products like paint and gasoline. This report may spark a closer look at lead from telecom cables.

Critics shot back that this kind of content is necessary to keep a platform from turning into a milquetoast playground for brands and influencers. Meanwhile, Threads adoption has continued to skyrocket: More than 70 million users had signed up as of Friday, including the account tracking Elon Musk’s private jet.

Does Prime get you too amped? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95V?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Logan Paul and KSI pose with Prime hydration bottles prior to a regular season game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 31, 2023, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CA. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95V?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
US lawmakers want to know. Yesterday, NY Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer asked the FDA to investigate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95W?mbcid=32030480.2827240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f6fcd6af720d> Prime, the hot new energy drink created by YouTube superstars Logan Paul and KSI last year.

The problem Schumer and health experts have with Prime is that a) it contains an egregious amount of caffeine and b) it’s incredibly popular among teens and kids, for whom egregious amounts of caffeine can have negative health impacts, such as anxiety and heart problems. It’s already been banned in some schools around the world.

So how much caffeine is in Prime? 200 milligrams per 12 ounces, the same as almost two Red Bulls or six Coke cans.

Prime seems to be aware that teens shouldn’t be drinking 200 mg of caffeine in four gulps, which is why the company slapped a “not recommended for children under 18” label on its drink. It has another drink, Prime Hydration, that has zero caffeine, but Schumer says that the company does not sufficiently differentiate between the two in its onslaught of social media marketing.

Bottom line: It’s going to take a powerful gravitational force to slow down Prime’s ascent. The brand rode its cult-like following to $250 million in retail sales in its first year, and it’s become the “official” sports drink of the LA Dodgers and FC Barcelona.

Is the buzz from your morning brew a placebo effect? New research on our namesake found coffee to be more brain-boosting than straight caffeine alone. Whether people have a cup of joe or a plain caffeine alternative, they feel alert afterward, but people who drank coffee <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94S?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=967e2418732b> also showed better memory and goal-directed behavior, according to brain scans. The study’s main author says people might feel these coffee-specific benefits because they associate the smell, taste, and experience of drinking coffee with seizing the day. More research is needed to see whether withdrawal relief plays a role and if decaf has similar go-get-’em effects.

The converter has one more stage of prototyping to go before it’s ready for prime time, but it’s entering a market that’s expected to balloon nearly 40% annually between now and 2029, per HTF Market Intelligence.

Static electricity propels ticks to their next meal. As if there weren’t enough reasons to hate the little bloodsuckers, ticks have been found to ride the pull of a static charge onto passing humans or animals. After dragging bedsheets through the woods and bringing the buggy haul back to the lab for experiments, scientists learned that the low-level electric field natural to living things can attract ticks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94U?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=99250cfa6419> from a few millimeters or even centimeters away. But knowing about this attraction might ultimately help us repel the disease-ridden creatures: Future experiments could explore if an antistatic spray keeps the ticks away.—ML

  Place to be: The islands with big Viking energy <#> Neolithic stones in the Orkney Islands A Neolithic stone circle on the Orkney Islands. Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

In the mid-15th century, the Orkney Islands were handed over from Norweigan and Danish control to Scotland as a dowry payment for a royal wedding.

Now, they might want to return. Feeling overlooked and underloved by the UK, Orkney Islands councilors voted last week to investigate other options for governance, such as becoming a more autonomous British crown dependency or even rejoining Norway after more than 550 years of separation.

It’s clear why reentering Norway’s orbit is attractive—in many ways, the Orkneys never left. While this cluster of about 70 low-lying islands is located just ~10 miles north of the Scottish mainland, it wears its Viking legacy proudly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95E?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9eeaf55b8a77>, even depicting bearded Norsemen on its ferries. Vikings first landed in the Orkneys in the late 8th century, found the place lovely, and ended up staying for another 500 years.

Tourists have also found the place lovely. Of course, on islands inhabited for ~8,500 years, there is a bounty of historical gems to take in, such as the 5,000-year-old village Skara Brae. But the islands have also played an important role in modern history because of their strategic location. Scapa Flow, one of the largest natural harbors in the world, is the final resting place of many doomed World War II ships.

When you’ve had your fill of the Neolithic ruins, you can check out the Orkneys’ other delights <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/950?mbcid=32017634.3216598&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=34605e430ad4>, like puffin colonies, seafood, and scenic walks along the coast.

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked you to pick one: a porch, patio, yard, rooftop, or deck. Here are our favorite responses:

* “Rooftop…I live in the mountains of northern Arizona and have breathtaking views. Plus, spitting seeds at my kids and them not realizing it’s me is definitely a bonus.”—Jonathan from Prescott, AZ

* “Front porch, because talking to your neighbors died with the back deck!”—Syd from NC

* “Definitely going with a large deck to put multiple cold plunges on. Me and the boys are staying cool this summer.”—Dustin from Edwards, CO

* “Screened-in porch. I grew up spending lots of time at Grandma’s, and there was something magical about sitting on the porch in the summer during a torrential downpour. You’re outside in the rain but inside and dry being taught how to play Casino and eating stuffed cabbage.”—Laurence (Grandma’s was in Far Rockaway, NY)

* “Definitely a yard. Mowing that is free therapy.”—Isaac

* “A covered porch. Too hot in Georgia to sit outside without some shade! Rooftop?? Northern idiots!”—Gary from Georgia

Good morning. PSA for anyone who is getting married and preparing to send a million thank-you notes: The price of a USPS first-class “Forever” stamp is rising from 63 cents to 66 cents, effective tomorrow.

You don’t hear a lot about stamp inflation, but it’s been soaring. The price of stamps has jumped 32% since early 2019 when they cost just 50 cents. Then again, the USPS has to make up for emptier mailboxes somehow. Volume for first-class mail (which encompasses letters) has plunged 51% since 2006.

Gen Z: You saved tinned fish and cottage cheese. Now bring back pen pals.

If you spent the past few days fanning your pits while crouching in front of a cranked up AC and housing down cherry Icees, get used to it.

Earth just keeps shattering temperature records <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/954?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=86b73dbfd90f>.

Monday ranked as Earth’s hottest day in 100,000+ years. Then the globe pulled a three-peat as each subsequent day through Thursday broke the heat record set the day before, making July 3–6 the hottest four days on record.

The steamy week followed the warmest June ever, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

And it’s no better down where it’s wetter: Sea ice levels off the coast of Antarctica have hit record lows, and the North Atlantic has recently broken temperature records…by a lot.

Why now? According to researchers, the rising mercury can be attributed to a combination of global climate change from human greenhouse gas emissions and the naturally occurring El Niño phenomenon, which raises temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and tends to bring hotter weather with it. So, we’re likely in for even more blistering days as July progresses—and possibly even the hottest year ever.

The dangerous heat levels are already impacting how we live and work.

Heat safety has been a major sticking point in the ongoing, contentious negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters Union that represents its drivers, causing the company to tentatively agree to air condition its trucks.

Beijing halted all outside work this week as the city experienced its longest streak of days above 95 degrees Fahrenheit since 1961.

But there are hopeful signs: If it’s going to keep getting hotter, we’ll have to figure out how to deal with it, while also weaning ourselves off the fossil fuels that contribute to climate change—and sweltering Texas has provided an example of how that might work. The state’s been able to keep its power grid running despite the heat wave thanks in large part to its solar and wind <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/955?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=de710575264c> energy supply.—AR

It’s been 500 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. As the conflict drags on <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/959?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b387c803c63b>, the fighting has reached a stalemate, though Ukraine is hoping to turn the tide with its recently launched counteroffensive. That effort got a boost yesterday after the US made the controversial decision to send cluster munitions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95a?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=447549f59cfe>, which are small scattered bombs that are banned in many countries because of their potential to harm civilians. Whoever ultimately wins, the war has already been a humanitarian disaster—the UN estimates at least 9,000 civilians have been killed. It has also impacted the global economy as most Western businesses have pulled out of Russia, and several nations have worked to wean themselves off Russian oil.

If you want an Apple headset, you’ll need an appointment. Desperate to strap Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro onto your face? Know that the mixed-reality headset’s rollout <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95b?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f36aedd61e4> is going to be a slow one. Bloomberg reports that the iPhone-maker will require in-store appointments, and that initially these will only be available at stores in major cities. Apple has also scaled back its ambitions: According to the Financial Times, after previously projecting it would sell a million headsets in the first year, the company is now planning for just 400,000. But, if you’re willing to wait, Apple is said to be planning a cheaper version and a second-gen Vision Pro for 2026.

It’s Taylor Swift’s world, we’re just living in it. If you somehow missed why the entire internet spent the day obsessing over a one-line lyric change to a 13-year-old song, it’s because Swift dropped her rerelease <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/95c?mbcid=32021395.2859729&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=be84b44e7c56> of Speak Now at midnight yesterday. She nixed the controversial reference to an actress being better known for “things that she does on a mattress” in “Better Than Revenge.” It’s the third re-recorded album she’s put out since announcing plans to revisit her first six to get control after the master recordings were sold to her enemy Scooter Braun—and the first two have outsold their original releases.

It’s summertime, baby, which means ice cream trucks are jingling, Friday beers are flowing, and private chefs are baking zucchini bread in the Hamptons.

Equipped with unfettered access to their employers’ herb gardens, kitchen wizzes are heading to the beach with the rich and famous—and they’re giving us drool-worthy glimpses into their homes and stomachs (but usually not their names) on TikTok. The platform said views of videos tagged with #privatechef have more than quadrupled since last June to surpass the one-billion mark, as people discover the escapist thrill of watching someone feed the Kardashian kids for a living.

These TikToks frequently feature white-marble kitchen islands, multi-thousand-dollar organic grocery hauls, and heirloom tomato pies.

But business is booming, and up-and-coming private chefs have started leveraging TikTok to bypass the it’s-who-you-know barriers to entry and book steady client work and brand deals.—ML

Though 16 people have died in the running since 1910, per the AP, no one was gored yesterday, and only six people suffered minor injuries. The dangers of the run don’t seem to stop people from flocking to the Spanish city to live out their Hemingway-inspired dreams—1.7 million tourists came to the festival last year and even more are expected this year now that all Covid restrictions have been lifted.

When you order, make sure you remember the four rules of soft-serve: a kiddie size is a medium, a small is a large, no biting allowed, and a regular cone > sugar cone.

Have a great one, we’ll see you tomorrow morning.

What is Threads? The hot new way for companies to ask if pineapple belongs on pizza for the 1,000th time. Threads is Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s attempt to do what many others have tried and failed before him: Bring over the public conversation from Twitter to a rival app.

Threads has impressive early traction, which can be attributed to users’ ability to link it to their existing Instagram accounts and port over followers. That’s why the app has a distinctly Michael Rubin White Party <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94w?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=317fbc0d21d9> vibe in its early days, with celebrities like the Kardashians and brands dominating the algorithmically curated feed.

How is Threads different from Twitter?

Well, that algorithmically curated feed, for one. The Meta team said it’s looking into creating a “following”-only feed, but right now you’re stuck sorting through influencers and verified accounts to find your friends—unlike Twitter, which offers a “for you” feed and a “following” feed.

Here are some other differences between the two apps:

Threads is pretty much mobile-only as it’s extremely limited on desktop. Meta said a desktop version is in the works.

Threads does not have a reverse-chronological feed.

There are no hashtags or keyword search functions in Threads, so users can’t follow trending topics or events in real-time like on Twitter. These functions are also on the list for future updates, according to Meta.

Threads doesn’t have DMs to slide into.

Musk fires back

Facing its most significant threat yet, Twitter threatened to sue <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/94x?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=861f95c510d8> Meta, accusing the company of poaching its employees to build Threads. Twitter lawyer Alex Spiro demanded that “Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information.”

In a statement to Semafor, Meta’s comms head Andy Stone denied hiring ex-Twitter employees to work on the Threads engineering team, saying “that’s just not a thing.”

Bottom line: Zuck has to be feeling good right now, having built an easily monetizable user base that’s already 13% of Twitter’s 229 million users in less than a day. But Threads is in its early days, and it remains to be seen whether it’s the Twitter killer everyone has been waiting for, a boring version of Instagram, or something else entirely.

OceanGate suspends its operations. The company that made the doomed Titan submersible said on its website it has “suspended all exploration <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/941?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ef4fee8df8ce> and commercial operations.” OceanGate’s CEO, Stockton Rush, died along with four passengers in the sub that presumably imploded on its way to visit the Titanic shipwreck in the North Atlantic last month. The Coast Guard’s highest level of investigation, a convening of the Marine Board of Investigation, will probe the disaster and expects to hold public hearings into what happened, per the AP.

The world’s largest spherical structure made its flashy debut this week, and you’ll never guess where it’s located.

That’s a joke—it’s obviously in Las Vegas. The MSG Sphere, a $2.3 billion venue one block east of the Vegas Strip, was fully illuminated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/947?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=205516f902d6> for the first time on July 4, and it’s already promising to overshadow other Vegas landmarks with its dominating physical presence and sensory-blasting capabilities.

This 366-foot-tall sphere is wrapped in 1.2 million LEDs—which together allegedly form the largest video screen on Earth—that can display anything one would want to display on a large sphere in the world’s entertainment capital. On July Fourth, the Sphere turned into a spooky eyeball <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/948?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0a2611008165> and an American flag and teased holiday-themed visuals like a snow globe and a jack-o’-lantern. It can also become a moon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/949?mbcid=32009254.2832757&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e234318825ce> that will make you feel like you’re on Tatooine.

But this thing isn’t hollow. Inside the Sphere is an arena that can fit nearly 18,000 people, and it’s slated to hold concerts, movies, and—since this is Vegas—sporting events like MMA and boxing.

Looking ahead…the Sphere will open on September 29 with a worthy act: U2.—NF

Good morning. On this day in 1957, Paul McCartney (age 15) first met John Lennon (16) at a garden party at St. Peter’s, Woolton’s Parish Church in Liverpool. It’s been called a chance encounter that changed the course of history.

First US law over AI bias in hiring tools takes force <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93n?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> People stand in front of a giant computer screen with a resume on the screen as other people stand on the side looking inside the computer. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93n?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The hiring manager who decides whether you get your next job may not be human as companies increasingly adopt AI tools for hiring. And a New York City law <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93o?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5706fd52a55a> that took effect yesterday wants to make sure that if the AI doesn’t pick you, it’s not because of an algorithm’s baked-in bias.

The concern is real: AI can exhibit racist and sexist biases (machines, they’re just like us!), and a survey last year by the Society for Human Resource Management found that almost one in four companies already uses AI in the hiring process.

The first-of-its-kind law requires companies to:

Notify job candidates who live in NYC that AI is being used and let them request info on what data is being collected.

Conduct yearly independent audits of any AI tools they use to make employment decisions to ensure they don’t discriminate based on sex, race, or ethnicity and publish ratios to show whether they disproportionately impact certain groups.

Businesses that don’t comply can be fined up to $1,500 per violation a day.

Everyone’s a critic

As with all things AI, the new law drew impassioned responses. It was passed in 2021, but got delayed for years while lawmakers sifted through a boatload of public comments on how to enforce it—many from businesses that called it an impractical burden.

Some public interest groups and advocates now say the final version doesn’t go far enough to root out discrimination. Because it focuses on AI making substantial decisions, it may not even apply to the popular use of software to winnow down job applicants before they’re screened by human staff.

Zoom out: NYC’s law will be the first to regulate bias in AI algorithms in the workplace, but it won’t be the last. And it’ll provide an important model for laws around the country. Legislators in California, New Jersey, Vermont, and New York are already drafting state-level laws.—AR

UPS union contract talks fell apart with a strike on the horizon. America’s largest private-sector package delivery service and the Teamsters Union representing 340,000 of its workers accused each other of walking away from negotiations over pay yesterday. The union plans to go on strike if a deal isn’t reached before the current contract expires on July 31, a move that could hobble supply chains and weigh on the US economy. Rivals like FedEx might benefit from picking up extra business, but they would likely struggle to take on all the 20 million packages that UPS handles daily.

Japan Airlines wants you to never again feel the agony of zipping a bursting-at-the-seams suitcase and lugging it to the airport only to learn that it’s 3.4 pounds overweight.

The airline debuted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93t?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fee85748dd37> its “Any Wear, Anywhere” service yesterday to let passengers rent clothes and receive them upon arrival in Japan.

The country’s flagship carrier wants to study whether the offering will encourage folks to pack light, allowing its planes to burn less greenhouse-gas-spewing fuel. Plus, it’s meant to reduce clothing waste through a partnership with trading firm Sumitomo Corp., which will supply overstock garments.

Here’s how it works:

Travelers assemble their Japan-trip wardrobe online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93u?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=153b78f550b9> by choosing up to eight sets of business or business casual clothes at $28–$49 each.

The outfits are delivered to their hotel, and travelers can keep them for up to two weeks.

Japan Airlines is one of several airlines making moves to give an environmentally friendly sheen to aviation, which causes 3.5% of human-induced climate change, according to one study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/93v?mbcid=31996706.98068&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e383aafe7358>.

Cities declare their independence from fireworks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/925?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Miami Beach, Florida, Ocean Terrace, Fire on the Fourth, 4th of July Festival, drone light show featuring Liberty Bell. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/925?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
As smoky skies blanket the East Coast and the West enters another wildfire season, many US cities are beginning to acknowledge that pounding the air with pyrotechnics in the middle of the summer is maybe not the best idea.

Expanding a trend that began in earnest last year, a number of cities—particularly in the West—are scrapping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/926?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f63cae8d145c> their July Fourth fireworks displays in favor of drone shows.

Salt Lake City will hold its first drone show for Independence Day to be “conscientious of both our air quality and the potential for wildfires,” Mayor Erin Mendenhall said.

Boulder, CO, is doing the same, citing “increased fire danger fueled by climate change.”

In California, Lake Tahoe and La Jolla are also opting for drone shows.

Community leaders hope their residents will embrace the change like baseball fans have the pitch clock. Not only are drones safer and better for the environment than fireworks, but they’re also quiet, which is great news for dog owners. Plus, they can tell a story in a way fireworks cannot.

As more events around the world, from the Super Bowl to New Year’s celebrations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/927?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1fdd549b142b>, adopt drone shows, the market for them has grown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/928?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b510cb55f492> from virtually nothing a decade ago to ~$1 billion in 2021, per Allied Market Research data cited by the NYT.

But the pryos aren’t going down without a fight

In fact, fireworks have never been more popular. Americans increased their spending on fireworks by about $100 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/929?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=baeb9f69c18a> this year compared to last summer, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association. If spending reaches $2.3 billion this season, as expected, that would represent a 3x increase from just 11 years ago.

Compared to synchronized drones, fireworks are cheaper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92a?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=06ca2e9527c6>—a small drone show could cost $20,000, while a fireworks display can land under $7,000, per Flying Magazine. Plus, even the coolest drone shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92b?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=00f27b3ebc8d> don’t stir the soul quite like the experience of watching explosives detonate hundreds of feet above you and illuminate the night sky.

Bottom line: As drone choreography goes mainstream and fireworks sales soar even higher, both types of shows will probably coexist on the July Fourth itinerary.—NF

“The Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest is the crucible through which greatness is forged,” George Shea likes to say.

It’s not bluster: Shea is the co-founder and chairman of Major League Eating, the organization that holds about 70 eating competitions throughout the year, including the July Fourth hot dog eating contest in Coney Island.

Shea’s performance as emcee of that contest has turned him into an American legend. Every Fourth of July at Nathan’s Famous, Shea goes viral for his <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92k?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb7ed95ef9b3> intros <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/92l?mbcid=31969177.3176806&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f5e7e65b908b> that whip a crowd of 35,000 people (and millions more watching at home) into a frenzy to cheer on the most prolific competitive eaters of our time.

Before the dogs hit the stage and the grandstands fill up with viewers hungry for drama, Morning Brew caught up with Shea to discuss what it’s like to witness greatness up close.

Here is a snippet from our interview.

MB: What is it like to watch Joey Chestnut eat up close?

GS: What I feel from Joey is this intense anxiety, focus, and fury. A whole-body tension. It’s like a spring wound way too tight. And it unwinds through the contest. It’s encased fury, but not anger so much as tension and energy. But the real takeaway for me is the dynamic between Joey and the crowd, the energy that comes back to the stage from the crowd is incredible. And so when I think of Joey eating, I’m sort of outside of that loop. But I’m right near that loop. And that loop is incredible.

The riots appear to be abating somewhat, but on Sunday, a Paris-area mayor’s wife and child were injured when a burning car hit their home in the middle of the night. The killing of the teenager, known as Nahel, at a traffic stop unleashed long-simmering frustrations over police mistreatment of French immigrants, particularly those of North African descent.

 ✢ A Note From Facet

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.

Dolphins say gitchy-gitchy-goo, too. We can’t help but turn it up an octave when talking to babies, and it turns out dolphins can’t, either. Bottlenose dolphin moms whistle at a higher tone and with more variation in their pitch when addressing their offspring, marine biologists who studied a group of Florida dolphins for more than three decades have determined. The findings were true for all 19 of the mic’d-up aquatic mothers. Researchers aren’t sure why, but it might be for the same reasons that other species use baby talk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90G?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ceb31309c378>: to catch a kid’s attention and teach them how to pronounce new sounds.

The universe is churning like the ocean. Astronomers are freaking out over a new finding that all but confirms what Einstein predicted in 1916: Outer space is not stagnant; it’s constantly being stretched and rippled by gravitational waves <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90H?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2030167c8a51>. For the first time ever, scientists have detected a long-theorized, low-frequency hum throughout the cosmos that they think emanates from black holes that helped shape galaxies far, far away (and a long, long time ago). The discovery marks “the beginning of a new journey into the universe to unveil some of its unsolved mysteries,” according to Dr. Michael Keith, a member of one of the teams that provided evidence.

Portrait of a pizza that’s actually flatbread. It seemed the history of tomato pies was about to be rewritten when archaeologists found what looked like pizza depicted in a 2,000-year-old painting in Pompeii…until they clarified that the delicious image in question was actually flatbread <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90I?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0b8865b0e95d>. Yes, there is a difference. The painting of a food platter—found on a wall adjacent to a previously buried Pompeii bakery—depicts mensa, a cheese- and tomato-less Roman flatbread that serves as an edible vehicle for other foods. Pizza as we know it wouldn’t have been possible back then since tomatoes didn’t even get to Italy until the 1500s. So, Naples, which sits just 15 miles from the city doomed by Vesuvius’s 79 BCE eruption, gets to keep its claim to fame as the 18th-century birthplace of pizza.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Does the US have a UFO retrieval program? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90q?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Alien spacecraft <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90q?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Coneyl Jay/Getty Images It’s a bird…it’s a plane…it’s…well, we’re actually not quite sure, so Happy World UFO Day!

Today is one of two UFO holidays commemorating the crash and recovery of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 during a frenzy of mysterious aerial disc sightings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91j?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=18e5a4bfb471>. The strange happenings spawned speculation that the government was covering up an alien visit to the town, and some diehard believers refused to drop the idea of little green men even after the Air Force admitted decades later that the “UFOs” were actually its spycraft.

But in recent years, the UFO conversation has moved beyond dubious claims made by the usual suspects <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90s?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4fa89bbfbd3c>. The Pentagon recently said it is studying 800 instances of military and civilian pilots encountering unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), a term used to describe any unexplained airborne specimen.

Then, last month, former military intelligence official David Grusch came forward with claims <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90u?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=880c6cf087a1> that the government has kept lawmakers and the public in the dark about its UAP retrieval program. While Grusch hasn’t talked about witnessing any alien spacecraft himself, he says his work on the ​​Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force gave him access to intel suggesting that:

* The military possesses “intact and partially intact” aircraft of “nonhuman origin,” as well as the remains of extraterrestrial beings.

* UFO crashes are a global phenomenon, and the US government once received a craft from Italy’s Benito Mussolini with the help of Pope Pius XII.

The Pentagon has denied it, but reportedly there have been other insiders who’ve made similar claims, and some of Grusch’s former colleagues vouched that his credibility was out of this world.

The government is looking into it

Grusch has filed a formal whistleblower complaint and submitted some of the classified material to Congress (though he has yet to provide proof to the public). Lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee plan to hold a hearing on the revelations soon.

Not everyone is buying Grusch’s disclosures, but the idea that the truth is out there has some takers on Capitol Hill.

* Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Newsweek he’s treating the claims seriously since they come from people with “high clearances and high positions within our government.”

* “I just believe it in my heart,” Republican Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett said of the possibility that the US has found extraterrestrial aircraft. He says his views on the matter are based on conversations he’s had with military pilots.

* Attending a classified military briefing in March brought Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to a similar conclusion. He said he’d seen evidence of craft that he’s not familiar with the US, its allies, or adversaries possessing.

What does the science say?

Not many scientists are willing to confirm (or debunk) claims that we’ve received visitors from other planets, with most agreeing that more research is needed to find an answer.

Some are plowing ahead with that research. One controversial Harvard astrophysicist started an observatory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90v?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e629b7ea2090> dedicated to using state-of-the-art tech to spot potential extraterrestrial spacecraft. Others are coming up with a system to study UAPs in a scientifically sound way. 

Last fall, NASA put together an interdisciplinary team of 16 scientists to develop a roadmap for UAP studies going forward, which they’ll present to the agency this month.

When asked by Morning Brew what’s missing from the way claims of UAPs are currently investigated, one of the NASA team members, oceanographer Paula Bontempi, quoted Carl Sagan in response: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

The group thinks eyewitness accounts aren’t reliable, and it’s busy developing rigorous methods to evaluate strangeness in the skies. This could involve using crowdsourced data from citizen scientists.

Bontempi said it’s important to combat the stigma associated with talking about UAPs by creating a reporting process that doesn’t make people fear becoming a laughing stock.

What the NASA group can say for now…is that there’s no better way to tackle UAP mysteries than with the scientific method. Another pro tip from the team: Don’t alienate anyone by jumping to premature conclusions.—SK

  Place to be: Nathan’s Famous hot dog stand <#> Nathan's Famous on the Coney Island Boardwalk. Anne Czichos/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

On the Fourth of July, the eyes of the nation will fixate on a tiny peninsula in Brooklyn to watch just how much salt and meat trimmings the human digestive system can handle before it shuts down.

We’re talking, of course, about Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island, a Fourth of July tradition that dates back to 1916.

That year, 24-year-old Jewish immigrant Nathan Handwerker stopped slicing bread at a restaurant to invent the next best thing: a hot dog stand <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90J?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1c16811bcf77> at the corner of Stillwell and Surf Avenues that served up fast, cheap, and savory finger food.

Fast forward to today, and Nathan’s Famous is a publicly traded corporation with franchises all over the world. Not only is the original shop in Coney Island still standing, but it’s a lot bigger and sells a variety of delights (cheeseburgers, lobster rolls, frog’s legs) you can bring with you on a stroll along the boardwalk.

Meanwhile, the hot dog contest held at Nathan’s has ballooned into a full-blown television event: ESPN has owned the broadcasting rights for the past 20 years.

You can even place wagers on it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90K?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2206fffc3dcb>, though don’t expect to make much money if you bet on Joey Chestnut or Miki Sudo to win. These two gastronomically talented athletes dominate the men’s and women’s divisions, and last year Chestnut won by 15 dogs while (expertly) subduing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/90L?mbcid=31957341.3222843&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=49bb41f27ec6> a protester who rushed the stage during the event.—NF

* “Saw a group smuggle a 24-pack of beer in a baby stroller. It was one of the most elaborate—and impressive—festival cons I’ve seen.”—Amanda from Fort Worth, TX

* “I met someone who plugged an air fryer into an outlet he found in a telephone pole, in which he cooked mini corn dogs and took them to a set to share with the crowd and even gave one to the artist onstage.”—Hailey from Pittsburgh, PA

* “Was at WE Fest, a country music festival in Detroit Lakes, MN, and on the last night, a bunch of kids lit a whole row of port-a-potties on fire .”—Miranda from Fairmont, MN

* "On the second day of the Chickenstock Music Festival in Chicken, AK, they hold a 5k race first thing in the morning. The route goes up a steep road, down the side of a hill, through the woods, and through streams. It’s marked with signs teasing people about being hungover. Also, the festival’s host wears a chicken suit, and they drop Peeps from a bush plane.”—Molly from Eugene, OR

Good morning and welcome to the new month. Today, in addition to being the first day of the second half of the year, is a sacred day for baseball fans: It’s Bobby Bonilla Day.

Every July 1, retired All-Star third baseman Bobby Bonilla receives a $1.19 million check from his former team, the New York Mets, even though he hasn’t played an MLB game in more than 20 years. The reason is that back in 2000, the Mets owed Bonilla $5.9 million, but instead of taking that cash up front, Bonilla worked out a contract that spreads out $30 million in guaranteed payments to him through annual installments from 2011–2035.

And so, July 1 has become an annual celebration of Bonilla’s financial planning and also an opportunity to tease the Mets even more than we already do.

Both landmark decisions were decided by a 6–3 vote along ideological lines in the conservative-majority court.

The high court dropped the rulings on the last day of its term. So, let’s dig into what the justices did before heading off for their summer vacation.

Student debt relief is toast

The Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 student debt for an estimated 43 million eligible borrowers.

SCOTUS ruled that the president needed congressional approval to direct his Education Secretary to cancel so much student debt. It would’ve been one of the priciest executive orders in history, costing the government $400 billion.

It rejected the administration’s argument that its plan was legal under a 2003 law that lets the Department of Education issue student debt relief in a national emergency.

The ruling had no immediate impact on anyone’s bank account because the program had already been halted by an appeals court. But it means that when student loan repayments start up again in October after a three-year pause for Covid, the debt relief many were counting on won’t be coming, ruining the summer Friday mood for millions of college grads struggling with student debt.

The program was popular: 26 million people had already signed up for debt relief and 53% of people polled by Reuters/Ipsos in March supported the plan. But it still had plenty of critics <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91Y?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=de8abc0a66bb> who claimed it could fuel inflation and mostly helped people who were already privileged.

Despite the loss, President Biden vowed to find other ways to ease the burden of American student loan borrowers, who collectively owe $1.77 trillion in education debt, per the Education Data Initiative, saying his administration is already working to enact a different debt relief program under another law.

Free speech trumps anti-discrimination

SCOTUS also decided that Christian graphic designer Lorie Smith, who says she’d like to get into the wedding website business, has the right to refuse to make sites for same-sex couples.

The conservative majority ruled that…

Smith is exempt from a Colorado state law that makes it illegal for businesses to refuse service to clients based on sexual orientation because her profession is a creative one.

Forcing her to make a website with content that she’s opposed to would violate her First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

In their dissent, the liberal justices called the decision “license to discriminate” and said it would have “the immediate, symbolic effect” of giving LGBTQ people second-class status. Advocates worry it could allow bigoted businesses to deny service to other minorities as well.—SK

SCOTUS to consider accused domestic abusers’ gun rights. After dropping two major decisions yesterday, the Supreme Court ensured that all eyes would stay glued to it next term by agreeing to take up a case over whether the government can bar people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91o?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b599fb9ed920>. It’s the first major Second Amendment case the court has agreed to hear since issuing a ruling last year that struck down New York gun restrictions and recognized for the first time a right to carry guns outside the home. It’s expected to clarify the standard that case set, which has led to many new challenges to gun laws.

FTC plans crackdown on fake online reviews.

Fake reviews that deceive consumers have always been forbidden, but the government hasn't done much about it. The new rules would mostly let social media and review sites off the hook and instead target businesses that buy and manipulate reviews. Some estimates say as many as 40% of all online reviews are bogus.

NASCAR to test Chicago’s need for speed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91q?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> NASCAR race car on Chicago bridge <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91q?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Patrick McDermott/Getty Images
The air is already filled with smoke and fireworks have been popping off for days, so when NASCAR stages <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91r?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=15cb3b40bce7> its first street race this weekend in downtown Chicago, it should fit right in. On Sunday, 37 drivers will race around the 2.2-mile track of city streets along Lake Michigan in hopes of wooing a new crop of racing fans.

It’s all a big test. Former mayor Lori Lightfoot signed a three-year deal with NASCAR last year hoping to beef up tourism in a downtown area hit hard by the shift to remote work. However,  new mayor Brandon Johnson isn’t quite as sold on revving engines and events featuring $63 six-packs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91s?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cccbe6b00cf2> of Busch Light, so how this weekend’s race plays out will likely determine the future of NASCAR’s partnership with the Windy City.

NASCAR claims its race will bring in $113 million plus generate an additional $3 million in tax revenue for the city.

But some residents say the deal only benefits wealthy visitors, since the event will clog up traffic and tickets range from $269 to over $3,000.

So far, the race is getting lapped: NASCAR is expecting 50,000 fans to attend each day of the weekend, but unlike when Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour made it impossible to book a room, hotels near the track aren’t even close <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91t?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=984818b68273> to being filled up.—MM

G’day, psychedelics: Australians who have struggled to find an effective treatment for their PTSD or depression can now ask their doctor if psilocybin or MDMA may be right for them.

Starting today, psychiatrists Down Under can seek approval to prescribe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91y?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=654edf8416b4> magic mushrooms and ecstasy. It’s the first time a whole country has recognized the psychedelics as medicine (when dosed properly) and offered them nationwide.

But it won’t be an easy trip

A course of special therapy sessions is estimated to cost between $9,900 and $16,600. Still, it seems a tipping point is finally here on hallucinogens’ long, strange trip to mainstream medicine—and not just in Australia.

This year, Oregon became the first US state to let people use mushrooms under professional supervision. Colorado—which just hosted a 12,000-person psychedelics conference featuring Aaron Rodgers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91z?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b9177f8872cf>—has voted to legalize, too.

Lawmakers in California, Connecticut, New York, Washington, Utah, New Jersey, and Missouri are also trying to secure the public’s right to trip.

Psilocybin and MDMA are still federally illegal in the US, but 61% of American voters support therapeutic access, according to a poll conducted by UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, and the FDA released its first draft of guidance on clinical psychedelic trials last month.

Stat: Big Tech might get all the big finance headlines, but there was also another group of stocks making massive gains this year: cruise line operators <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91E?mbcid=31960172.97189&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=45a8d21d5299>. Carnival (up 136% YTD) and Royal Caribbean (up 113%) were among the top five gainers in the S&P 500 for the first half of the year (alongside Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla) as people went back on vacation at sea and they recovered from pandemic lows. All that cruising does have a downside, though. There have been 13 norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships since January—that’s the largest number for a single year since 2012, per the WSJ, and we’re only halfway through.

SCOTUS strikes down affirmative action <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZK?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> UNC Chapel Hill campus <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZK?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Eros Hoagland/Getty Images
The Supreme Court ruled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZL?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c92f6c53ba47> yesterday that colleges cannot consider race in the admissions process, a decision that overturns 40 years of precedent and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for diversity initiatives on campuses and in corporate boardrooms.

In a 6–3 ruling along ideological lines, the majority-conservative court sided with Students for Fair Admissions, the group that filed lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that claimed that the institutions discriminated against white and Asian American students by giving Black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants a boost in admissions considerations.

Following the opinion, which is part of a wave of recent SCOTUS decisions President Biden called “out of sorts with the basic value system of the American people,” Biden urged schools to continue to promote racial diversity. But college admissions officials say that attempts to increase diversity in other ways, like using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race or expanding recruiting efforts geographically, almost always fall short.

Corporate diversity could take a hit, too

Legal experts warn that the Supreme Court’s rollback of affirmative action opens the door for challenges to race-conscious diversity programming in the workplace, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, as well as diversity quotas companies have in place for hiring and promotions.

Experts are recommending that companies swap out their use of the word “diversity” for phrasing like “Title VII compliance” or the title “chief diversity officer” for “chief transformation officer” to avoid potential litigation.

Business leaders and labor lawyers say companies should count on spending time—and money—to prepare for increased legal action launched by critics of diversity policies.

Corporate America might also need to build new pipelines for diverse talent. Last year, nearly 80 US firms including Apple, Meta, and Google filed a brief in support of affirmative action as the policy headed to court, saying that they “depend on university admissions programs that lead to graduates educated in racially and ethnically diverse environments.”

Looking ahead…pencil in another top story about the Supreme Court tomorrow. SCOTUS’s ruling on President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan is expected this morning before they, like the entire workforce in Western Europe, break for summer.—CC

The passengers were three Italians who flew up to a peak altitude of 279,000 feet to enjoy the view and conduct scientific experiments.

Meanwhile, the police officer who killed the teenager known as Nahel M. was arrested on charges of voluntary homicide. French President Emmanuel Macron said the shooting was “inexcusable” but also called the rioting “totally unjustifiable.”

The men are accused of trading shares in Digital World Acquisition Corp. based on nonpublic knowledge and making bank in October 2021 when news it planned to acquire Truth Social made its stock soar.

Aspartame to be named a possible cancer-causer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZT?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Aspartame, one of the most popular artificial sweeteners, is found most diet sodas and many other products. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZT?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Your friend who proudly drinks regular Coke might be insufferable today: Aspartame is set to be labeled as “possibly carcinogenic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZU?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eabbe033e8b6>” next month when the World Health Organization releases two reviews of the popular artificial sweetener, according to Reuters.

The report on aspartame—found not only in most diet sodas but also in teas, chewing gums, yogurts, and Mrs. Butterworth’s sugar-free syrup—is expected on July 14 from the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), alongside a second WHO committee’s new recommendation on dosing, which hasn’t yet been revealed. Until now, it had been widely accepted that someone would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda to be at risk.

But, many items on the WHO’s “possibly carcinogenic” list <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZV?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6d9ba3e3f1cd> are still common in daily life: mobile phones, carpentry, and putting baby powder on your nether regions, to name a few.

The IARC has been criticized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ZW?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=40ae2950b1dc> in the past for stirring up confusion when releasing new classifications…like when it added processed meats to the carcinogenic category—the worst one—which inspired a bunch of cold-cuts-is-the-new-smoking headlines.

Big Cola is big mad: Groups representing products containing aspartame are already calling the classification misleading and panicking over how this might sway consumers to change their habits…or potentially sue companies. But Diet Pepsi is sitting pretty because it ditched aspartame in 2020.—ML

Enhanced Games says let them run on ’roids <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z-?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Athlete holding Enhanced Games flag <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z-?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Enhanced Games
Taking an idea that has emerged from many stoner basements, one Australian entrepreneur wants to remake the Olympics, but with drugs. Aron D’Souza has announced the Enhanced Games, a drug-test-free sporting event that aims to reward a new, ’roided up class of athletes—like this anonymous sprinter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Z_?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9eb304a1fa30> who claims to have beaten Usain Bolt’s 100m record.

Is this a joke? Nope. D’Souza, the president and founder of Enhanced Games as well as the legal mind behind Peter Thiel’s takedown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8-0?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b97ba84d935e> of media company Gawker, has been hyping up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8-1?mbcid=31946110.2852786&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41ce3f61d348> his plans to host the first event in 2024 (no word on location). He also told the Guardian he has two famous athletes on board (no word on which ones) and a bunch of Silicon Valley investors interested (again, no specifics). D’Souza’s event will include five categories: track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, and combat sports.

Enhanced Games says it’s fighting a battle for the soul of sports. The event’s website accuses traditional athletic competitions like the Olympics of being “anti-science” and shaming “enhanced athletes.”

But traditional sports are pushing back. Representatives from the Olympics have spoken out against D’Souza for promoting unhealthy practices. Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll said Monday that the Enhanced Games are “both dangerous and irresponsible.”—MM

Good morning. One of the most frequently asked questions we get from readers is: What determines the order of the Brew writers’ names in this intro section? Despite what you may have speculated, it is not Neal picking favorites like he’s Abby Lee Miller on Dance Moms.

It just represents the order of the authors of the news stories. So in today’s edition, Molly wrote the Shein story, Cassandra tackled air travel, and Matty made a joke about bulk Costco ham. Abby and Neal edited those stories and filled in the rest of the sections. Sorry if that isn’t as exciting as any of your conspiracy theories.

—Molly Liebergall, Cassandra Cassidy, Matty Merritt, Abby Rubenstein, Neal Freyman

Shein’s influencer trip is not beating the sweatshop allegations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T3?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Fashion influencers were invited to tour a Shein model factory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T3?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Shein
Fast-fashion behemoth Shein recently pulled a Willy Wonka and invited a few influencers to tour one of its 6,000 factories. But instead of generating positive PR, the creators who went are getting flamed for promoting what’s being called a propaganda trip.

Despite the brand’s history of alleged environmental harm and human rights abuses, a bunch of videos set to upbeat music show the fashion influencers praising their all-expenses-paid journey to a Shein “model factory” in Guangzhou, China. The clips have incited an online firestorm, including a viral parody <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T4?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=65a1eb116fc6> in which a sustainable fashion supporter pretends to gush over the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.

In a now-deleted video, Dani Carbonari, who’s been especially dragged for calling herself an investigative journalist but sounding like a Facebook uncle, said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T5?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e20a8fe62856>, “The China trip has been one of the most life-changing trips of my life,” and that her “biggest takeaway from this trip is to be an independent thinker, get the facts, and see it with your own two eyes.”

But actual investigative journalists have seen Shein’s inner workings with their own two eyes. A documentary <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T6?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b48f88e4ccc5> released last fall revealed that workers were being paid pennies per clothing item on 18-hour shifts with almost no days off…which makes sense for Shein’s cheap and fast business model. Two dozen members of Congress have asked the SEC to halt the brand’s desired IPO until allegations of forced labor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T7?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f6461e7950c> are investigated.

Zoom out: Brand trips have been a thing since the early days of YouTube vlogging, but the public has soured on the promotional vacations, so they’re becoming riskier for companies. Tarte Cosmetics recently came under fire <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8T8?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ab89006f1f9b> for “tone-deaf” displays of luxury on an influencer trip to Dubai, and for reportedly giving creators of color second-class treatment.—ML

Mass flight cancellations put a damper on the 4th <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SW?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Airport departures dashboard with all flights canceled or delayed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SW?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Now may be the time to invest in an Amtrak pass. A combination of thunderstorms and staffing shortages led to more than 20,000 delayed and 5,000 canceled flights <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SX?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2facb91fbc5c> across the country this week.

And as we head into the Fourth of July weekend, with the TSA predicting tomorrow will be the busiest day of air travel since the pandemic began, more chaos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SY?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=dffc1e9c9bdb> is likely still to come.

What’s the problem? The bad weather isn’t helping, and workers remain hard to come by even as travel has come roaring back post-pandemic. Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, which has had the most cancellations, blamed FAA staffing issues, and he’s not alone. An audit of the FAA found:

77% of critical facilities (like Air Traffic Control) are staffed below the 85% level the agency considers necessary.

FAA facilities in New York and Miami are staffed at 54% and 66%, respectively, which “poses a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations,” per the report.

Gone are the days of snagging your grandpa’s Costco card and buying a metric ton of ham on visits home. The retailer said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SM?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1d85bf802763> it’s getting serious about preventing non-members using members’ cards to enjoy the bulk riches.

Technically, it was always against the store’s policy to use someone else’s membership card. But workers at the home of the $1.50 hot dog will now require shoppers using self-checkout to show their IDs. And those IDs had better match the Costco cards.

Why now? The retailer relies heavily on membership fees—which brought in $4.2 billion in 2022—to offset its cheap prices, low margins, and now, inflation. Costco’s profits dipped 4% last quarter despite a 2% increase in revenue.

So if you want to keep buying cheap rotisserie chickens, you’ll have to join the ranks of Costco’s 124.7 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8SN?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a136849c7eeb> cardholders. A Gold Star Membership will set you back $60, while an Executive Membership costs $120 and offers some bonuses (like a 2% rebate at the end of the year as well as auto and travel perks).

Stat: If you’re hoping to pivot to a high-paying job, you might want to go back to school—not to level up your skills but to become eligible for an internship <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Tc?mbcid=31933179.2829272&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e62f974c90f9> on Wall Street. Interns at Citadel are making a median $120 per hour this summer, a 25% jump from last year, according to Bloomberg. Big banks are also shelling out to nab young talent (Citi’s paying $50 per hour), and offering perks like sign-on bonuses. In what we’re sure is totally unrelated news, recent and soon-to-be college grads polled by the CFA Institute ranked finance as the No. 1 industry they’d like to work in (in 2021, it ranked fifth). Citadel got more than 69,000 applicants for its internship program.

And Mondays? They’re “touch and go,” Roth said. But he doesn’t think you’re going to kill his business by refusing to put pants on—the company is betting that workers will still be willing to schlep into the office on other days, as long as the commute’s not too bad. And it’s betting big, pouring $1.2 billion into revamping office buildings next to Penn Station.

Good morning. There’s only one full-service state standing. Last week, Oregon lawmakers overturned a 72-year-old prohibition on pumping your own gas at gas stations, making New Jersey the only US state that still requires an attendant to fill up your tank.

Oregonians, welcome to the club. You’re about to discover one of the greatest joys in life: stopping the meter right on a round number.

The summer the world turned pink <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8P9?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustrated pink globe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8P9?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
On Monday, Airbnb listed a real-life Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pa?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a35129edb347> hosted by “Ken.” It’s only available for two one-night stays, but if you’re lucky enough to score one of them, it won’t cost you a dime: “Ken’s thing is beach, not math,” according to a press release.

The Dreamhouse rental is yet another viral marketing stunt for the upcoming Barbie movie, which has cemented itself as the cultural event of the summer. A promotional effort that began in the spring with a selfie generator <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/4Jf?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41430c8f8f5e> and a beguiling trailer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pb?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fe4e4295034c> (what exactly is the plot?) has ballooned to include seemingly infinite partnerships and even a themed boat cruise in Boston, proving that Kris Jenner works hard, but Barbie’s marketing team works harder.

In fact, the hype around the movie has inspired a whole new wave of interior design:

It’s leading more adults to decorate their homes in Barbiecore, “a palette made up primarily of hot pink, and similarly bold rosy hues like fuchsia and magenta,” the NYT reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pc?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f54795a527b9>.

According to the Times, searches for “Barbie aesthetic bedroom” on Pinterest jumped 1,135% from May 2022 to May 2023.

The pink fuzz is generating ear-piercing buzz

Mattel is hoping that these Barbie licensing deals will jolt the company from its current slumber: In the first quarter, it suffered an operating loss of $115 million and revenue fell 22% YoY.

Chicago residents most vulnerable from the smoke were urged to spend more time indoors, while all Michiganders received an air quality alert. The smoke from Quebec’s fires has even wafted over the Atlantic Ocean <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pm?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=91f257074f8b> to Portugal, Spain, France, and other European countries—but unlike the haze that Dune-ified NYC a few weeks ago, the smoke in Europe does not present a health risk, since it’s much higher up in the atmosphere.

In his lawsuit, the rapper and business mogul claimed that Diageo under-promoted his liquor brands—Ciroc vodka and DeLeón tequila—while hyping other celebrity spirits brands in its portfolio, such as George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila. Diddy accused Diageo of racial discrimination, claiming the company considered DeLeón a “black brand” to be marketed to “urban” customers. Diageo has denied the allegations but decided their business relationship was irreparable.

An EV startup that was supposed to save an Ohio town from going under…has gone under.

Lordstown Motors, maker of the Endurance electric pickup with in-wheel motors, filed for bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pq?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7c36d9c081a6> yesterday. It’s also suing its largest shareholder, Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, for failing to plug it with promised investments.

But just four years ago, it seemed like Lordstown Motors would be the Batman to its Gotham City: Lordstown, Ohio. In 2019, the company swooped in to buy a recently shuttered GM plant that used to be Lordstown’s largest employer.

The facility was repurposed for producing the Endurance, which Lordstown hoped would beat the likes of Rivian’s R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning as the first electric pickup to hit the road.

Two weeks after longtime host Pat Sajak said he was retiring from Triple Toss-Ups, the iconic game show Wheel of Fortune has found its new vowel seller: Ryan Seacrest.

That was fast. Sony Pictures Television likely didn’t want to flirt with any game show drama after everyone finally forgot about its Jeopardy! host-hunting fiasco <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Px?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=87406476c7d9> following Alex Trebek’s death.

Seacrest is inheriting a Wheel that is still spinning after 48 years on air. At its peak in the 1980s, Wheel of Fortune brought in 40 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Py?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a990b1151f2c> nightly viewers, and while those numbers have dropped off significantly, it still averages about 8.6 million.

From frosted tips to million-dollar gifts: In 2002, Seacrest skyrocketed to fame by interviewing hopeful pop stars and attractive people who were never told they couldn’t sing on American Idol. The man seems to always be juggling about five jobs at a time: Seacrest has hosted New Year’s Eve events, DJ’d radio shows, and gabbed with Kelly Ripa for six years on the morning talk show Live (which he left in April).

But…his new gig may not be such a time commitment. Being a primetime game show host is one of the most enviable jobs in Hollywood because it provides stability, offers mega payouts, and you only work a few days of the month. Meanwhile, Vanna White—who was rumored to be on the successor list—will stay on when Seacrest takes over, but she’s aggressively negotiating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Pz?mbcid=31922288.2802994&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=07820b5dd2fd> her first pay raise in 18 years, according to Puck.—MM

Good morning. A healthcare mystery may just have been cracked, and the suspect:  Mr. Harold, in the kitchen, with a pickleball racket.

You see, a few weeks ago UnitedHealth Group said more people were using the healthcare system (bad news for insurers), and no one exactly knew what was up, Bloomberg reported.

UBS calculated that the game’s surging popularity—among seniors, in particular—will contribute $377 million in medical costs this year for procedures like hip replacements and knee surgeries.

It makes intuitive sense, but this still reeks of Big Tennis.

Weight-loss drugs are ditching the needle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jk?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Novo Nordisk will ask for FDA approval on a semaglutide pill for weight loss <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jk?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Just when it seemed the weight-loss drug race couldn’t get any more frenzied, the makers of popular obesity medications said “Hold my syringe.”

Novo Nordisk said yesterday it will seek FDA approval this year for a pill version of its pound-shedding medication, Wegovy (Ozempic for weight loss), after finding that an oral alternative was just as effective as the injectable version.

That leaves Pfizer and Eli Lilly—the maker of Mounjaro <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jl?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f0dec9d4df2d>, a recent breakout in weight loss—trailing a bit behind as the three drugmakers compete <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jm?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0008d0055c8f> for the biggest slice of a fast-growing industry that could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade, analysts estimate. Pfizer’s CEO has estimated that an obesity pill could rake in $10 billion each year for the company that makes it.

In Novo Nordisk’s final trials before FDA review, diabetics lost up to 20 pounds and non-diabetics lost an average of 35 pounds—or 15% of their body weight—on a high-dose daily pill version of semaglutide (the generic name for Ozempic and Wegovy).

Competitor Eli Lilly’s oral weight loss drug, orforlipron, enabled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jn?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fed10366a108> non-diabetic users to lose up to 14.7% of their body weight in phase two studies (one step behind final trials). So far, nothing rivals Eli Lilly’s injectable, Mounjaro, which reduces body weight by 22.5%, on average.

Diabetics who pop the high dose of Pfizer’s pill, danuglipron, shed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jo?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cb683c98c059> an average of 10 pounds, according to mid-phase two trial results. Pfizer was developing a second pill, too, but just dropped it after discovering it could harm people’s livers.

But it’s not all pills and rainbows. Some medical professionals think an oral option for weight loss will help those who get squeamish around needles, but critics worry the ease could put pressure on people who are overweight. There’s no timeline yet on when the semaglutide pill form will hit the market, which is still suffering from demand-fueled shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic injectables.—ML

Saudi Arabia plans to lure tourists with luxury resorts and a built-from-scratch city, but it’s already the host of the world’s largest pilgrimage. The biggest Hajj since pre-pandemic times commenced yesterday, with 2 million Muslims from all corners of the world headed to the ancient city of Mecca.

But visiting Islam’s holiest site is unusually pricey this year, as rampant inflation strains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jw?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=69effec14177> worshipers’ wallets. It’s typical for folks to spend years saving up for the sacred journey, which is obligatory for every devout Muslim whose health and finances allow it.

That second caveat is all the more relevant these days:

The most budget-friendly Hajj tour option from Egypt costs ~$5,663, almost double <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Jx?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c22781690d26> what it cost in local currency last year, according to the Associated Press.

One Palestinian pilgrim told Reuters he’s traveling by land and staying in a shared hotel room for $7,000, a price that would’ve covered airfare last year.

For the first time ever, fewer than the maximum permitted number of travelers from Bangladesh and Pakistan will make the trip because of its sky-high price tag.

Zoom out: Even though it’s mostly oil money that gives Saudi the cash to do things like buy golf, its economy counts on the Hajj and the year-round Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca to generate $12 billion in revenue annually, per pre-pandemic estimates.—SK

For Tigers: The LSU Tigers clinched the Men’s College World Series title yesterday, defeating the Florida Gators in their second championship of the week. The first, of course, went to LSU fans for consuming the most Jell-O shots at Rocco’s Pizza & Cantina.

Meet the College World Series of Jell-O Shots. What started in 2019 at an Omaha bar across from the baseball field as a goofy way to keep track of how many Jell-O shots fans consumed has morphed into a monster event of its own, with a Twitter account, a business partnership, and donations to charity:

LSU got a big boost from rounds of several thousand shots from alums looking to break records.

In order to get ready for this jelly, Rocco’s teamed up with Jevo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8JW?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa132da3db60>, whose machines can make 100 Jell-O shots every four minutes.

Part of the profits go to food banks at each participating university, and an Omaha food pantry.

Stat: As of last year, 73% of US adults had ditched their landlines and were living the cell-only lifestyle—three times as many as in 2010, according to a Washington Post analysis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8JB?mbcid=31909492.2867624&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f59a5593105> of the National Health Interview Survey. As anyone who still calls their parents’ home phone could probably guess, the households where landlines outnumber those with just mobile phones are people 65 and older. Landline havers are also most likely to be located in the Northeast, likely because Verizon is the main provider in the region, meaning many households switched to faster internet earlier, when having a landline was still in vogue, and aren’t bothering to drop it from their package now.

“This coup could have been an email,” one Twitter user quipped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DJ?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=23fc0ffaa091>. And while it was shorter than a test cricket match, the mutiny will leave a long-term stain on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule, exposing him to threats he had never faced before in more than 20 years leading Russia.

The tl;dr (too long; didn’t revolt)

On Friday, the businessman who leads the Wagner private army for Russia, Yevgeny Prigozhin, dramatically escalated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DK?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a6bbeae992d9> his long-simmering feud with the country’s military leadership, posting messages on Telegram that accused Russia’s defense minister of bombing his troops. He announced a “march for justice” against the Russian defense system.

As Prigozhin and his Wagner army marched toward Moscow, Russia charged him with mounting an open rebellion. Bizarre scenes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DL?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=43eeac81ad94> of everyday life comingling with an armed revolt in the major Russian city of Rostov-on-Don spread across social media.

Leaders in Ukraine and the West, unsure of which thug (Prigozhin or Putin) they’d rather have in control of Russia’s stacked nuclear arsenal, looked on and grabbed the popcorn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DM?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7120ce08f14>.

After being on the cusp of civil war on Saturday, the two sides agreed to a truce that would send Prigozhin to Belarus in exchange for amnesty, and Wagner troops would stand down from their march on Moscow.

Who is Prigozhin and what is the Wagner Group? Nicknamed “Putin’s chef,” Prigozhin is a one-time catering tycoon who founded the Wagner Group, a network of soldiers-for-hire that Russia has used to expand its influence in places like Syria and Africa through ruthless tactics. In the current war, Russia has relied heavily on Wagner’s mercenaries to fight against Ukraine.

Authorities said the worst-case scenario (sodium hydro sulfate leaking into the river) was averted but that cars carrying asphalt and molten sulfur had been “compromised,” so they’re testing the water quality. The collapse also severed the main fiber-optic cable that runs through Montana, hampering internet access for Global Net customers.

Is having a fruit on your license plate the new Sports Illustrated cover jinx?

Florida (oranges) and Georgia (peaches) are both experiencing the lowest production of their big-name fruits in decades, which could drive prices for products like OJ even higher than they are now.

Let’s start in Florida, where the citrus harvest this season could be its smallest since 1928 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DY?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6911c072ae5b>: 18 million boxes, compared to a peak of 250 million boxes in the ’90s and early 2000s, according to the Washington Post. Nasty weather in the fall and winter compounded longer-term challenges like greening disease to devastate Florida’s famous citrus groves. And if you do get your hands on fresh-squeezed Florida orange juice, don’t expect it to be the religious experience you’re used to: Orange trees affected with greening disease (which is virtually all of them) produce more bitter fruit.

Moving to the other side of the Florida–Georgia line…country singers might have to find a new simile for “sweet” because Georgia peaches have been almost completely wiped out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DZ?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=be5dfe0b9833> this year. Warm winter weather followed by a cold snap in March have destroyed 95% of the crop, which farmers say is the worst harvest since 1955.

Bottom line: Florida is far more dependent on its citrus harvest than Georgia is on its peaches. In Florida, the citrus industry is worth $6.9 billion, per the University of Florida, while peaches are mostly symbolic for Georgia: They brought in $34 million in revenue <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8D-?mbcid=31898566.2808356&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a084f31f1a9c> last year, compared to $1.4 billion for cotton.

What’s going on in Toronto? The previous mayor of North America’s fourth-largest city resigned following a scandal, leaving a leadership void to tackle Toronto’s mounting problems, including skyrocketing housing prices and quality-of-life issues. And getting your name on the Toronto mayoral ballot is easy: All you need to do is pay $189 and get 25 signatures.

Roe v. Wade reversal: 1 year later <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CX?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Abortion protestors in front of the Supreme Court. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CX?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
A year ago today, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and erased the nearly 50-year-old federal protection for abortion access. And even with a leaked draft alerting the country of the decision a month before it came down, how exactly abortion access would change around the country was still an open question.

But a year in, here’s where we’re at:

Restrictions started immediately…25 states have passed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CY?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a0cd7c6d2b08> some form of new abortion restrictions in the past year. And of those, 13 states have passed near-total or total abortion bans, some with no exceptions for rape or incest.

On the flip side…20 states have passed laws protecting abortion rights. But being a safe haven for abortion seekers can come with its own challenges. Planned Parenthood of Illinois saw a 54% spike in patients over the last year, and one clinic in Kansas City has received so many out-of-state patients that it’s only able to help 10%–15% of people seeking abortions.

If it feels hard to keep track of what’s legal where, it’s because it is. So far this year, 700 bills (about half aiming to restrict abortion and half hoping to protect it) have been introduced in state legislatures, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

What’s next? Possibly another major SCOTUS ruling: The battle over mifepristone <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8CZ?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12b2705a227f>, a common pill used in medication abortions, is currently making its way through the courts and will likely end up with SCOTUS, along with a few other abortion-related cases.

A Gallup poll from last week shows public support for first trimester abortion has never been higher, reaching 69%, and when new restrictions have been part of ballot initiatives, residents of states they’ve been shot down—even in Republican-controlled states like Kansas and Kentucky. So, you can expect Democrats to make it a key issue in the 2024 election.

Top generals accused Prigozhin of trying to mount a coup, and Russian security services were placed on alert. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin published biting criticism of Russia’s military leadership and said Vladimir Putin was deceived into invading Ukraine. The public infighting is considered a threat to Putin’s power.

Starbucks baristas at more than 150 stores plan to take a break from spelling people’s names wrong to protest recent incidents where managers allegedly banned rainbow flags and other Pride decorations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8D3?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6c5fc9badfd5>.

The strike kicked off yesterday at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle and over the next week 3,500 fellow unionized workers are expected to join in.

This is about LGBTQIA+ representation and better working conditions: Some of the participating locations didn’t have any Pride decor issues—they’re protesting in solidarity and to put pressure on Starbucks for better worker pay and benefits. Since the first location voted to unionize in late 2021, Starbucks has fought hard against the union, which now claims the company has stalled their already lengthy contract negotiations by refusing to bargain remotely via Zoom.

Okay, perhaps not that shallow…but a historic drought <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Db?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d0794d7c37dc> has been emptying the vital trade waterway since January, and the Panama Canal Authority says El Niño could exacerbate the situation. The lack of rainfall has forced the canal operator to further lower the maximum depth of ships allowed through, threatening to snarl international commerce.

Starting tomorrow, ships with hulls extending further than 43.5 feet below the water’s surface will be forced to shed some kilos to pass.

The limit has been incrementally lowered from the usual 50 feet in order to avert another Suez Canal debacle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8Dc?mbcid=31889645.2797459&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e32ddb5f667f> when one grounded ship blocked $10 billion worth of daily trade.

The restriction could slow traffic through the busy connector of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which services 3.5% of global trade, according to Quartz. The canal is a major throughway for international container shipments and especially for US liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Asia. Some cargo might have to be dispersed across multiple vessels, potentially creating traffic jams.

The search for the Titanic tourist sub is over <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zc?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Five died in the OceanGate Titan disaster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zc?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Handout/Getty Images
The marine mystery that captivated the world this week had a tragic conclusion: Authorities confirmed yesterday that they found broken pieces of the OceanGate Titan submersible near the Titanic wreckage it was en route to explore, meaning its five passengers are dead.

They are: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, British explorer Hamish Harding, Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, and his son, Suleman Dawood (who, according to his aunt, was “terrified <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2bda887bac1e>” of the trip but ultimately went to please his dad for Father's Day).

The details: A “catastrophic implosion” of the Titan vessel left a field of debris that was found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zd?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1d48be6509cc> on the North Atlantic floor yesterday afternoon, 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic, US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said at a press conference.

When asked about the possibility of recovering the passengers’ bodies, Mauger implied there may not be anything left to find: “This is an incredibly unforgiving environment down there on the seafloor.”

What does this disaster mean for extreme tourism?

Wealthy adventurers might think twice before paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to risk their lives visiting the treacherous, less-explored parts of the world.

The adventure tourism <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ze?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e8f866c76d4> industry was expected to skyrocket from $322 billion in 2022 to more than $1 trillion in 2023, according to Grand View Research.

Popular destinations for extreme tourists are the Titanic, Mount Everest, the South Pole, and a favorite frontier for billionaires: space.

Twelve people have already died this year trying to climb Everest, and five are still missing, adding fuel to critics’ calls for the adventure industry to receive more government oversight.

Years ago, experts sounded the alarm. In a 2018 letter to OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, the Marine Technology Society said Titan was not up to certain safety standards, risking “serious consequences for everyone in the industry.” The next year, Rush told Smithsonian magazine that the commercial sub industry, which hadn’t had a serious incident since 1960, was so “obscenely safe” that it hadn’t “innovated or grown.”

Titanic director James Cameron echoed the safety concerns. Yesterday, he said he was “struck by the similarity of the Titanic disaster itself, where the captain was repeatedly warned about ice ahead of his ship and yet he steamed at full speed into an ice field.” —ML

3M reaches major settlement over “forever chemicals” claims: The manufacturing giant agreed to pay $10.3 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zn?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=52d18509ab87> to settle a barrage of allegations from US cities and towns that it contaminated their drinking water with chemicals known as PFAS. For decades, 3M has used these chemicals (which are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they refuse to break down in the environment or the human body) in products such as firefighting foam, but hundreds of cities sued it for polluting their water and soil. If the settlement is approved, the money will go toward helping these cities clean up their water.

Disposable vapes are booming. You’ve seen them inhaled at parties, discarded on city sidewalks, and sold in strip malls: Refillable e-cigarettes are taking over the US vape market.

The rise of disposables shows how the government’s vaping crackdown is like playing whack-a-mole—the FDA snuffed out refillable brands such as Juul and Vuse in 2020, but a new crop of vapable plastic has emerged to take their place. Overall, US e-cig sales grew 47% in the period analyzed.

The world just can’t ditch inflation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Gold star with "you tried" sticker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yl?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Like your younger sister, inflation will just not take the hint and get lost. And so, as they’ve done for more than a year now, central bankers around the globe are hiking interest rates even more to stamp out inflation once and for all.

Yesterday, the Bank of England shocked markets by jacking up interest rates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zm?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c98fadda3e8c> by half a percentage point to their highest level in 15 years. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and Norway have all announced rate hikes in the last few weeks.

Even Turkey, which over the past two years has lowered interest rates to combat inflation (a bonehead move, economists say), went back to Econ 101 and raised interest rates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ym?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=82fb60824e84> by 6.5% yesterday.

It’s probably gonna happen here, too. Although the Fed decided to pause rate hikes last week, Chair Jerome Powell said on Capitol Hill yesterday that Americans should expect one or two more <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yn?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c5eb9dfd642> increases this year. Because, while buying eggs and gas doesn’t hurt quite as much as it used to, the prices of many consumer goods and services are still rising uncomfortably fast. The Consumer Price Index, a broad measure of inflation, rose 4% in May, double the Fed’s 2% goal.

Bottom line: Central banks are all of us trying to slightly turn up the AC in our parents’ house without causing chaos (i.e., a recession). But the longer inflation sticks around, the harder that gets.—MM

Victor Wembanyama is officially a San Antonio Spur after being selected No. 1 overall <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zv?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a0859202381c> in the NBA draft last night. The (possibly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zp?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=951f4353cd40>) 7-foot-4 French phenom joins a group of international players that is dominating the US-based league and fueling its influence overseas.

Wembanyama, who’s been called the greatest NBA prospect since LeBron James, catapulted to basketball fame as a teenager because he manages to be an extremely coordinated person while also being an extremely tall one. His size enables him to play killer defense (dude can block a shot just by standing up), but he can also dribble and shoot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zq?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8cfe083f63fe>—skills typically reserved for shorter players, and certainly not those with an eight-foot wingspan.

The growing presence of international stars in the NBA is hard to miss. As American legends like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry get older, the NBA is becoming a magnet for foreign talent—and taking its product to the source.

The last five MVP awards were given to three international players: Joel Embiid (Cameroon), recent NBA champ Nikola Jokić (Serbia), and Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece and Nigeria).

The NBA staged a buzzy game in Paris earlier this year, and the league and the French government are planning to deepen ties ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games (hosted in...Paris).

What’s with the Euro takeover? Wembanyama, who started playing professional basketball in France when he was 15, argues that the European system of going pro early instead of playing college ball like in the US better prepares players for the demands of the NBA: “We play at a higher level than American prospects in better competitions,” he said earlier this week.—CC

Stat: Americans gave just 1.7% of their personal disposable income to charity last year, which is the lowest share <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yA?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6d4ce717f4c9> since 1995, according to a new Giving USA report. You can chalk that up to economic uncertainty, inflation, and the fact that individuals feel like they’re making less of an impact than bigger philanthropists, per Axios. Speaking of bigger philanthropists, Warren Buffett just donated another $4.6 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yB?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d2868cf8b49f> of Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charities, bringing his total giving to over $51 billion.

Wait a sec…regular napping makes your brain larger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8yD?mbcid=31876955.3222172&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=777c4ca7e2ea>? How is this not the biggest headline in the world? That’s the conclusion reached by a new study that compared people age 40–69 who were genetically predisposed to take naps vs. people who weren’t, and the researchers found that the nappers—through their naps—had bigger brains that were equivalent to people 2.6–6.5 years younger. The study does have limitations, such as finding that napping has no effect on three other brain measures. But it does apparently preserve brain volume.

**Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Facet Wealth, Inc.

Good morning. The Women’s World Cup is less than one month away, and the two-time defending champ, the USA, is looking to make history: No country’s team, men’s or women’s, has won the World Cup back-to-back-to-back.

The quest to break the record began for real yesterday when the US released its 23-player roster. It’s heavy on newbies—14 players will be making their World Cup debut, joining vets like Alex Morgan, Julie Ertz, and Megan Rapinoe.

So, get very hype, but also be aware that many games will be on at odd hours (like, 3am ET) since the tournament is being held in Australia and New Zealand. Surprisingly, some US cities are not being total squares about it: Washington, DC, just approved a proposal allowing restaurants and bars to remain open 24/7 during the World Cup.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the US on Tuesday, and tonight he’ll be feted at a state dinner <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ue?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=efcee52fc0ba>—making him only the third world leader to get one during Joe Biden’s presidency. While we don’t know whether the guest of honor will enjoy the saffron-infused risotto, we do know what he’ll be talking about in between bites: deepening economic ties.

One major topic will be a guest not invited: China. With US–China relations fraught, American companies are looking to diversify their manufacturing base, and India has been seizing the opportunity that provides.

India and the US are already plenty economically intertwined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uf?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=97ea73311b38>—especially in the tech sector:

Apple has shifted some iPhone production from China to India, and CEO Tim Cook attended the opening of the nation’s first Apple store in April.

About half of IBM’s workforce is located in India, according to Axios.

Around 60 Fortune 500 companies are run by CEOs of Indian origin, including Google and Adobe.

And with CEOs from Apple, Microsoft, FedEx, and Marriott among the anticipated guests at tonight’s gala, per CNBC, the relationship will only get stronger. New deals are expected to be announced during Modi’s stay, and he’s hoping to return home with:

A promise from Tesla. The prime minister met with self-proclaimed Modi “fan” Elon Musk on Tuesday, and Musk said Modi pushed for “significant investments” in India—which Musk said he intends to make. The Tesla CEO said the company will be in India “as soon as humanly possible.”

Permission to manufacture military jet engines. It’s been in the works for a while, but the Biden administration will probably officially authorize General Electric to make F414 engines in India, a necessary step since defense technology is heavily regulated.

There's a catch: Both the US and India want to counter China’s economic might, but there are concerns about Modi’s record on human rights: He has cracked down on dissent and free speech and helped sow religious discord.—AR

Search widens, time narrows for missing Titanic sub. If the Titan, the submersible that went missing Sunday with five people on board as it journeyed toward the wreckage of the Titanic, is not found by around 6am today, there is little hope of there being survivors due to a lack of oxygen. However, as of yesterday, the Coast Guard said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mZ?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2f33f1c873f7> it was still a search-and-rescue mission, and more ships were sent out to search an area twice the size of Connecticut.

It noted that Singer subsequently had cases before the high court, including one his firm won concerning billions of dollars in debt repayments from Argentina. Alito took the unusual step of defending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8v7?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ec437b39289> himself in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published first, saying he had “no obligation” to recuse himself and wasn’t even aware Singer was involved in the case.

Bad US accounting is good for Ukraine. After discovering a major error in its accounting, the Pentagon realized it could send another $6.2 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine—without having to ask Congress for more aid cash. The oopsie that the Pentagon described to the Washington Post as “valuation errors” first came to light last month, but then it was considered only $3 billion because the Pentagon got the math wrong…again. The news comes as Ukraine needs to gear up for its counteroffensive to win back territory seized by Russia since the invasion.

Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Amazon Prime’s user design.

The FTC certainly thinks you have. Yesterday, the agency filed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uk?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a2cfec89ef2> a lawsuit alleging that Amazon violated consumer protection laws by manipulating millions of customers into signing up—and staying signed up—for its $139-a-year Prime service. The lawsuit claims Amazon did this by:

Making it harder for customers to buy products without a Prime membership.

Utilizing “dark patterns,” a design tactic that subtly convinces users to perform a specific action, to get people to enroll in Prime without their consent.

Designing a cancellation process that took six clicks, which was referred to internally as the “Iliad Flow,” a reference to Homer’s doorstop epic poem.

The lawsuit accused Amazon leadership of being complicit in the company “tricking and trapping” customers, saying that they “slowed or rejected changes that would’ve made it easier for users to cancel Prime because those changes adversely affected Amazon’s bottom line.”

It’s not just Amazon: The FTC proposed rule changes in March that would require companies to make canceling a subscription as easy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ul?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=01e25652d9c8> as signing up for one.

Some diners will soon be able to skip the egg and get straight to the chicken: Two Bay Area-based startups received the go-ahead yesterday from the US Department of Agriculture to sell lab-grown poultry to American consumers for the first time.

The scientist-made meat will initially only be available in two swanky restaurants (one in San Francisco and one in Washington, DC), but the startups, Good Meat and Upside Foods, plan to roll it out to grocery stores eventually.

Supporters of slaughter-free “cultured <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8uq?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b7478d418ade>” meat—which grows from a sample of an animal’s cells—say this is a big step toward a more humane and environmentally friendly meat industry.  But the challenge of scaling production could keep cultured meat a novelty for those who can afford it.

Upside <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ur?mbcid=31862642.2839769&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=abd3243e4f70> hopes to expand production to 400,000 pounds of cultured meat per year. According to poultry industry experts Watt Global Media, Tyson, America’s largest poultry producer, churns out about 200 million pounds…per week.

The startups haven’t revealed the price for their lab-grown chicken cutlets, but they’re expected to eventually cost $20 per pound, rivaling the cost of high-quality organic chicken.

Zoom out: It’ll be years before lab-grown chicken makes it to grocery store shelves, but in that time, scientist-made pork, lamb, fish, and beef could also get approved—150 companies worldwide are looking to grow their own meat and have already raised $3 billion.—ML

A battle of the tech billionaires is brewing: After Elon Musk tweeted that he’d be “up for a cage match” against Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg, the newly ripped Zuck agreed to take him up on the offer via Instagram. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that Zuck’s reply was not a joke. The rivalry stems from Meta’s efforts to build a Twitter competitor, which prompted Musk, who runs five companies, to tweet measured and mature responses like “Zuck my .” If the tech titans have it out, our money’s on recent jujitsu tournament winner Zuck, even if Musk is pretty scrappy.

Good morning. Today is the first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, or as Neil deGrasse Tyson would call it, the summer solstice. You might think, “If today is the solstice…then what the heck is an equinox?” Here’s a cheat sheet:

A solstice occurs when one of the Earth’s poles (today, it’s the north) tilts toward the sun at the maximum angle. The two solstices, in December and June, mark the beginning of winter and summer and give us the longest days and nights of the year.

Equinoxes are essentially the opposite of solstices. Deriving from the Latin for “equal night,” the equinox is when the sun is directly over the equator, leading to roughly the same amount of day and night. Spring and fall begin on equinoxes.

Hope you enjoyed your ride on the Magic School Bus. Let’s get to the news.

Time is running out to find missing submersible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mg?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> OceanGate Titan submersible underwater <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mg?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> OceanGate/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images
A desperate search-and-rescue mission has escalated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mh?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a550609fa6d3> to find Titan, the OceanGate tourist submersible that disappeared Sunday while diving toward the Titanic wreckage. Yesterday afternoon, the US Coast Guard estimated that Titan had fewer than 40 hours of oxygen remaining to sustain life.

We don’t know how Titan got into this situation, but potential explanations include that Titan is floating on the ocean surface after suffering a communication outage (best-case scenario), got tangled in the Titanic wreckage, or suffered a disastrous hull breach (worst-case scenario).

The five people on board include the CEO of OceanGate, a father-son duo from a wealthy Pakistani family, a British billionaire explorer, and a Titanic expert who has led six expeditions to the wreckage. They are deadbolted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mi?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=91a917d5571a> inside by at least 17 bolts, according to a reporter who previously took this trip, and can’t get out unless they’re rescued.

Rescue ops face a time and resource crunch

The US Coast Guard had searched 10,000 square miles of ocean as of yesterday morning, but poor visibility and bad weather have presented additional challenges to a mission that one expert told the BBC is “like searching for a mine in a minefield.”

In an attempt to locate the vessel, rescuers have dispatched aircraft in case Titan surfaces and sonar buoys, which can detect moving objects underwater.

But finding the van-sized watercraft before the oxygen runs out will likely depend on using a remote-operated vehicle, or ROV, which is one of only a few vessels capable of salvaging material at depths of 20,000 feet. The problem is that the Titanic wreckage sits 370 miles from the coast of Newfoundland, and the ships that carry ROVs move at ~20mph, according to the New York Times.

Big picture: OceanGate’s Titanic voyages are a part of the growing “extreme tourism” industry that ferries the uber-wealthy to rarely explored places miles above—and below—sea level. But these trips aren’t guaranteed to end with a champagne shower <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mj?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=aa7ae6613c22> from Richard Branson, and the potential disaster aboard Titan highlights the elevated risks associated with this kind of travel.

As part of the agreement, Biden will admit that he failed to pay more than $100,000 in taxes on his income of at least $1.5 million in 2017–2018. This deal will likely allow Biden to avoid jail time, but Republicans in Congress have promised to continue their probes into his business dealings.

If your neighborhood reeks of sawdust, it’s because the number of homebuilding projects started rose <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mu?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=16665a7f7c63> 21.7% in May from the prior month to the highest level in more than a year, according to the US Census Bureau.

The dramatic spike in home groundbreakings shocked analysts, and it’s great news for a country in desperate need of more pads. The US has 3.8 million fewer houses than it needs, per Freddie Mac.

What’s behind the shortage? The pace of homebuilding has still not fully recovered from the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008. Meanwhile, recent interest rate hikes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mv?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=38932629ed98> have made homeowners reluctant to sell (since a mortgage for a new property would be more expensive), contributing to the supply crunch.

But your housing shortage is homebuilders’ opportunity:

And homebuilder confidence has risen for six months straight, per a survey from the National Association of Home Builders.

Schneider National, looking to hire drivers, has placed in-game billboard ads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mB?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=45a4906e98ea> on American Truck Simulator, a popular video game that lets players load, drive, and park 18-wheelers in excruciating detail. The game penalizes you when you break road rules and even simulates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mC?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=851b1bee422f> different types of transmissions, per the Washington Post.

The ads show how desperate the trucking industry is to recruit new talent. US trucking companies were short a record 80,000 drivers in 2021, and that number could reach 160,000 by 2030, according to the American Trucking Association.

While in-game ads usually get roasted by gamers, the reaction to the recruitment drive from virtual truckers has been generally positive. One gamer tweeted, “This doesn’t annoy people,” which is about as cheery as gamers can get.

Using video games for recruitment isn’t new. For two decades, the US military published a free, first-person shooter game, America’s Army, to reach future soldiers before shutting it down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8mD?mbcid=31852018.3223236&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7a23d5b37998> last year. An MIT study in 2008 found that the game was the Army’s most positively impactful advertising tool at the time.—MM

You don’t often hear “US infrastructure” and “shockingly good news” paired together in the same sentence, but Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Saturday that the recently collapsed section of I-95 in Philly will reopen within two weeks—way ahead of schedule.

The lesson: It may take the US 30 years to build a new train line, but never get between Americans and their cars.

Bold immigration experiment boosts Canada’s population <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i-?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Canada immigration application <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i-?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Manjurul/Getty Images
Canada’s people-to-maple-tree ratio is getting bigger, as its population recently became 40 million strong.

The land of making New England winters look like a tropical paradise reached <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i_?mbcid=31838525.2822460&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c3a215c07a67> the demographic milestone mostly by politely telling foreign workers, students, and refugee to come on in.

The government has set an ambitious goal of adding 500,000 new permanent residents a year by 2025 as part of its strategy to keep Canada young. While many other high-income economies struggle with an aging native-born population and a shrinking workforce, Canada hopes that newcomers will step up to care for its elderly, invent new tech, and cook up Timbits.

Over a million foreign arrivals that Canada welcomed in 2022 accounted for 96% of its headcount growth last year, according to Statistics Canada.

That puts its population growth rate at 2.7%, making it the fastest growing high-income economy in the world, per Bloomberg.

The country prioritizes admitting the most employable folks by taking into account potential immigrants’ age, language skills, and education. But some say that adapting to the influx of people is not as simple as laying out a giant “welcome/bienvenue” mat.

There are concerns that Canada’s housing supply and infrastructure are struggling to accommodate so many new residents. Skeptics point to surging home prices in large cities as evidence that the immigration ramp-up is straining resources.

The planned purchase surpasses the previous record for an aircraft deal, set by Air India for 470 planes earlier this year, and will more than double IndiGo’s fleet, which currently stands at 300. That this is the second record-breaking aviation deal by an Indian airline in six months is no coincidence—the country is gearing up for a spike in air travel demand due to immense population growth and sustained interest in travel post-pandemic.

Hotez said he won’t debate science but is willing to come on the show alone. Still, he claimed the online attention caused a pair of anti-vaccine activists to show up at his house.

Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.

Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year.

Life is possible on one of Saturn’s moons. Scientists have found all the ingredients needed to support life in an extraterrestrial ocean for the first time, indicating that the waters of one of Saturn’s small moons, Enceladus, are habitable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hI?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0f7a9fe7d376>. While this doesn’t mean that there are little sea creatures living there, the presence of phosphorus—which scientists say is the rarest bioessential element in the universe—suggests there definitely could be. A NASA mission to land on Enceladus and search for life has been tentatively proposed for 2050, so we won’t get answers soon.

🪰 A fly’s lifespan shortens after seeing dead flies. Fruit flies become more antisocial and die faster after seeing or smelling their dead, and the scientists who discovered this say it could also help us understand how people react to being around dead bodies. Similar reactions to being around the dead have been found in other insects and mammals, which suggests that all species might have a connection between their sensory perceptions and life spans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hJ?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bacde5f10960>, according to researchers. They think the fruit fly’s reaction could be an evolutionary adaptation to being in a stressful situation.

Extra confidence makes hot people earn more. It’s already been established that attractiveness tends to trigger preferential treatment, but new research suggests that excessive self-confidence may cause hot people <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hK?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=20f37c18dd16> in finance to get more promotions and money than their normal-looking colleagues. “Due to their great bargaining power, attractive individuals may have learned that they deserve better,” writes one researcher. But the “halo effect” that gives beautiful people better treatment also considers personality: In another study, photos of good-hearted folks got rated as more attractive once participants knew they were looking at kind people.—ML

  Can congestion pricing curb NYC traffic? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York traffic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hL?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Alexander Spatari/Getty Images New Yorkers know the rules: Skip the small talk, limit the grocery run to what you can haul to a sixth-floor walk-up, and avoid getting behind the wheel in the city at all costs.

In fact, the costs of driving are only getting higher: NYC is getting closer to charging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hM?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=da40a3e27f9d> people for driving downtown in an attempt to curb rush-hour traffic.

Known as congestion pricing, the fee is meant to encourage commuters to ditch their cars for the train or bus while raising cash to improve public transit.

After a public review period ended Monday, the city is waiting for the final go-ahead from federal authorities to roll out the first congestion charge in a US city as early as next spring. And, as they say, if congestion pricing can make it here, it...will probably spread to other US cities looking to smother traffic and boost revenue.

The policy has helped unclog roads in places like London, Stockholm, and Singapore, and transit wonks in the US are eager to see whether it will catch on here. But, as with anything else, New Yorkers have strong opinions—many of them negative. So, let’s break it down.

Here’s how this would work

* Cars driving into Manhattan anywhere below 60th Street (the area dubbed the central business district) would face a daily toll.

* The exact amount isn’t known yet, but it could be anywhere from $9 to $23 per day for passenger cars, with a reduced fee in off times and a possible discount for low-income drivers.

The MTA expects the congestion charge to reduce the number of cars on the road by up to 20%. And the move is expected to make Manhattan’s air cleaner and its streets safer.

Meanwhile, the fees would raise $1 billion a year, according to the NYC comptroller, and the MTA could use the money to improve service for its trains and buses. With the country’s largest transit system struggling to make ends meet, the fee touted as a win-win.

But is the toll too steep?

Many people are upset about paying to endure Manhattan’s gridlock (even if congestion pricing will raise the average rush-hour speed, which is currently about 7 mph). Some critics say it could hurt low-income drivers, while others worry about potential losses for businesses in the central business district that rely on commercial vehicles.

Outer borough residents aren’t thrilled, either. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican from New York who represents Staten Island, called it a “cash grab” by the MTA and expressed concern that drivers would bypass the tolls by driving through the borough. The MTA acknowledges that the pricing scheme will likely cause more congestion in other parts of town and pollution (the agency has proposed pollution mitigation strategies).

But non-city dwellers might be the least chill with New York’s plan: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lashed out at the measure this week, saying it amounts to a tax on NJ residents who already pay tolls to drive into Manhattan for work.

Pushback to the pushback

“Congestion pricing will not make the sky fall,” Nicholas J. Klein, assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, told Morning Brew, since most people already travel into the area via public transit, walking, or biking.

Associate Professor of Urban Planning at UCLA Michael Manville noted that most people traveling to Manhattan by car can afford the extra charge as they’re already willing to shell out a fortune for parking. And he emphasizes that those who will pay the congestion toll will benefit from a zippier commute.

  Place to be: The (beachy) birthplace of Juneteenth <#> Flying over Galveston Texas Sea Wall and Beach Erico Overton/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Tomorrow, Americans around the country will attend festivals, host backyard barbecues, and parade through the streets to celebrate Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US.

But to understand how Juneteenth began, you have to go to one place: Galveston, TX <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hY?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=78f8aadd9002>.

In this historic port city on the Gulf of Mexico, a Union general informed enslaved Black people in Texas that they were free. The date: June 19, 1865, nearly two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued (information took a while to travel during the Civil War).

Juneteenth only became a federal holiday in 2021, but it’s been celebrated in Galveston for more than 150 years. It’s especially personal for many Black residents of the city, since they can trace their lineage back to the enslaved people who were freed on the original Juneteenth.

As the birthplace of Juneteenth, Galveston offers many opportunities <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8hZ?mbcid=31818241.3219367&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9543446c1cee> to learn about the holiday. But the city more broadly is a candy store for history buffs—it was a major commercial center in the 19th century thanks to its deepwater port, and the downtown Strand District, lined with Victorian buildings, was once known as the “Wall Street of the South.”

* “I’m wearing these to my next Zoom training at work so I can simultaneously learn how not to violate HIPAA laws and also enjoy my favorite episodes of The Office and maybe Seinfeld.”—Flava from Phoenix, AZ

* “Uhh, chopping onions. Why else would I wear goggles indoors?”—Ari from Brooklyn, NY

* “Skiing. While going downhill, it gives you directions to the shortest lift line, and on the lift, you can VR downhill to get extra runs in. When you’re done, it takes you to the nearest hot tub with drink service.”—Jake from Colorado

This week’s question

Grimace, the purple McDonald’s mascot, had his birthday last week. To celebrate the chaotic Gemini, the fast-food chain rolled out a birthday meal promotion consisting of medium fries, a choice of a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNugget, and a berry-flavored purple milkshake. So, here’s our question: What other mascot needs their own birthday meal and what would the meal be?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “Lil’ Red, sidekick to the University of Nebraska’s other mascot and beefed-up cowboy, Herbie Husker, should celebrate his birthday with three slices of Casey’s breakfast pizza, a large cherry Pepsi, and the gray Pride skittles.”

Looming UPS strike threatens to deliver economic chaos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i5?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> UPS truck <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i5?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
United Parcel Service might soon not be at your service as its workers threaten to walk off the job. Members of the Teamsters union representing 340,000 UPS workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8i6?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=03341c7c1ad7> a strike if they can’t agree to a new contract by July 31.

If the labor action happens, it would be the biggest strike against a single employer in US history, with much more than just your drop-shipping dreams at stake.

The US without UPS

A UPS work stoppage would cause economic mayhem, snarling supply chains in a throwback to the pandemic-era days when tracking one’s delayed Amazon order was America’s favorite pastime.

UPS is the largest shipping service in the nation, according to CNN, moving enough goods to account for about 6% of the US GDP, per the company’s own estimates.

Senders would need to find an alternative delivery method for 24 million packages (about a quarter of all packages nationwide) that UPS delivers daily, per global shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes.

Analysts say that companies are already shifting orders to other shipping providers like FedEx and DHL, though no single entity could handle all its packages. But the logistics chaos can still be averted if UPS drivers and warehouse workers reach an agreement with their bosses.

What could send workers to the picket lines?

The Teamsters want higher wages, more full-time work, the elimination of what they call “forced overtime,” and better working conditions. Union members are particularly disgruntled by a system in which new employees get paid significantly less than old-timers.

The union says that folks on the UPS payroll deserve a share in the company’s success, as it reached a record $100 billion in revenue last year. According to ABC, many UPS employees feel shortchanged by a 2018 contract that has been credited with helping the company grow its profits.

But, in a sign that the labor conflict might cool, a major breakthrough in the negotiations was reached on Tuesday when UPS management agreed to include AC in vehicles purchased after Jan. 1, 2024.

Zoom out: If the UPS drivers’ union delivers results, that could embolden employees at other companies, like the workers at Amazon—whom The Teamsters are also trying to unionize.—SK

DOJ highlights major problems with Minneapolis police.

As a result, the DOJ is working with the MPD on an agreement that would require it to make changes. President Biden called the report “a positive step forward,” but also urged Congress to pass a law improving US policing.

DraftKings bets bigger than Fanatics on PointsBet.

DraftKings says it can get a green light from regulators faster because it already operates in the areas PointsBet does. “I guess they are more concerned about us than I would have thought,” Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin snarked to CNBC, calling the rival offer a bid to delay his company from entering a new market.

Ja Morant suspended for 25 games over second gun video.

The punishment was handed down after Morant had already faced an eight game suspension over an earlier video of him with a gun in a Denver nightclub. ESPN estimated that the latest penalty will cost the player, who was due to make $33.5 million next season ~$7.5 million. But Nike, which has an endorsement deal with the star, said it would continue “to support him on and off the court."

We can now add Spotify to the list of high-profile institutions Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have parted ways with.

The couple’s $20 million deal to create content for the company, announced in 2020 after the pair broke with the royal family, is over <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ic?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12f37a428cf7>. It yielded…just one podcast series, Archetypes, hosted by Meghan, which will not be renewed for a second season, despite debuting at the top of Spotify’s charts and featuring guests like Serena Williams and Mariah Carey.

For those keeping score, the couple’s efforts to rebrand themselves as media moguls have yielded some hits: Their Netflix docuseries commanded millions of viewers, and Harry’s memoir, Spare, became the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time. But the deal with Spotify won’t rank as one of their successes—the Wall Street Journal reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8id?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9adad99577b8> the couple didn’t hit the benchmarks to get the full $20 million.

Zoom out: Though both sides painted the end of the collab as mutual, the demise of the Sussexes’s deal reflects a larger podcast pivot at Spotify. The company laid off 200 people this month as part of its turn away from exclusive deals like this one. Spotify will now focus on making money off ads rather than using pods to drive sign-ups after investing more than $1 billion in podcasting.—AR

Grimace takes over the internet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ih?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Grimace, one of the original McDonaldland characters, has gone viral <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ih?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo: McDonald's/ Photo Illustration: Hannah Minn
McDonald’s recently announced a new meal campaign starring its purple mascot, Grimace, in true cat-ran-across-my-keyboard fashion: by tweeting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ii?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d7cce41ea32d> “fhioea;odijcfaewklcldW,” followed by a selfie captioned “it grimace i’m taking over.”

The offering features a new purple shake that some say tastes like Fruity Pebbles, or bubblegum, or the milk of a screaming Grimace <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ik?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a9114d7310d>.

McDonald’s even released a video game <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8il?mbcid=31821614.2843691&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3f939434e101> starring a skateboarding Grimace that tugs at the Game Boy Color heartstrings. The pixelated adventure reacquaints players with classic McDonaldland characters who starred in brand advertising from the 1970s until 2003.

Why the throwback? Nostalgia marketing plays to our emotions, and in this case, McDonald’s is targeting millennials and some Gen Zers who grew up during the mascot-heavy heyday of its ad campaigns. “We’re excited to put a modern spin on these memories to continue to drive McDonald’s relevance with a new generation,” the company explained in a press release.

With tensions rising between the US and China, US CEOs have been flocking to China lately, traveling to the major market to smooth things over—but Gates’s visit marks the president’s first known meeting with an American business leader this year. The reception for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s finally taking his delayed trip to China this weekend, is not expected to be as warm.

Good morning. Yesterday, Sweden reported higher-than-expected inflation for May, causing economists to wonder: What could have kept prices elevated?

And then it hit them like a ray of sun: Beyoncé. The pop superstar kicked off her Renaissance tour in Stockholm last month, drawing 80,000+ fans to the city’s Friends Arena over two nights. In response to the influx of concertgoers, hotels and restaurants raised their prices to such a degree that it boosted overall inflation, Danske Bank concluded.

The fact that one person, by the sheer force of her popularity, was responsible for higher inflation in an entire country is…not normal. Danske’s chief economist in Sweden, Michael Grahn, said, “It’s quite astonishing for a single event. We haven’t seen this before.”

Bud Light’s fall from No. 1 was a long time coming <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bs?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Bud Light is no longer America's top-selling beer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bs?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Hannah Minn/Morning Brew
Pour one out for Bud Light—for the first time in more than two decades, the blue-canned beverage is no longer the top-selling beer in the US. Following years of declines and a monthslong boycott that further tanked sales, Bud Light is now second to the gold-foiled Modelo Especial.

But this shift in the brewski hierarchy has been years in the making: American drinkers have been getting thirstier for Mexican import beers, in addition to wines, spirits, and seltzers. Modelo, a Mexican lager, was already set to surpass Bud Light <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bt?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=22d66311066a> as early as next year, so the boycott in response to Bud Light’s partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney just sped things up, according to the Wall Street Journal.

While Modelo has enjoyed double-digit growth in at least 35 of the past 40 years, Bud Light’s dominance over US retail-store beer sales has been sliding for more than a decade. Its market share steadily declined from 19% in 2010 to 10% in the days leading up to Mulvaney’s viral Instagram post, in which she showcased a personalized tallboy the company sent her.

Since Mulvaney’s post on April 1, Bud Light’s market share dropped sharply and now sits at 7.3%, while Modelo leads with 8.4%, according to the consulting firm Bump Williams. In that same time, shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bud Light’s parent company, fell by 15% amid broader S&P 500 gains.

Other Anheuser-Busch beers like Budweiser, Busch Light, and Michelob Ultra have also experienced declines since April, and some distributors—many of which are independently owned by families—are now considering layoffs to counter their losses.

Seller’s remorse? Anheuser-Busch actually owns Grupo Modelo—the Mexican brewery that makes Modelo, Corona, and Pacífico—everywhere except in the US. Back in 2013, as part of an antitrust deal, Anheuser-Busch sold the US rights to Modelo to Constellation Brands, which owns big names like SVEDKA and Kim Crawford Wines.—ML

The EU wants to break up Google’s ad tech business. Two years after opening a probe into whether Google unlawfully boosted its own ad tech over others, the EU finally slapped the company with a formal antitrust complaint <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bx?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=533297d257e7> yesterday, accusing it of abusing its position. The complaint is a doozy; it suggests Google will likely need to sell off parts of the business to resolve its “inherent conflicts of interest” in the digital advertising world. Expect a long legal battle: The online ads provided 80% of Alphabet’s $280 billion annual revenue last year.

Neely was experiencing homelessness and mental health issues, and a video of Penny putting him in a chokehold sparked protests and calls for prosecution. Penny has maintained that he was defending himself and his fellow passengers, and after several Republican politicians praised him, a legal fund for him raised nearly $3 million.

Air con has been a major sticking point in negotiations between the company and the Teamsters, which represents 340,000 UPS workers. Union members are expected to authorize a strike if there’s no final deal by the time their current contract expires on July 31. A strike would have major economic fallout: UPS estimates that 6% of the US gross domestic product gets transported in its trucks.

Check on your friends with high-paying jobs you can’t quite explain: They might be the first to be replaced by AI. McKinsey & Co. released <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8bJ?mbcid=31796755.2854964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=65fe678d84ed> a report this week on how generative AI (think ChatGPT and Midjourney) will change the world’s workforce.

The findings: After examining 2,100 tasks across 850 jobs around the globe, the report concluded that generative AI could add anywhere from $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion worth of value to the global economy. How? By giving businesses more use cases for AI and revving up productivity like we’ve never seen before, especially for workers in customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development fields.

The report expects generative AI to automate tasks that take up 60%–70% of people’s working hours. In an ideal world, this means more time for the fun parts of your job, or four-day workweeks. But in this world, it could mean your future coworkers are large language models.

Good morning and Happy Flag Day, which commemorates the day in 1777 that the Stars and Stripes was first adopted. Here are some other flag facts:

The current design is the 27th iteration of the flag and the longest-used design, since the US hasn’t added a new state since 1959 (plus the 51st star would mess up the symmetry).

Despite what you may have learned in middle school, there’s no evidence Betsy Ross had any role in making the first flag.

Last year, four senators introduced the All-American Flag Act to require the federal government to exclusively buy American flags made in the USA. As of 2017, the US imported 10 million American flags from abroad, 99.5% of which were made in China.

If you’re in Minneapolis or Honolulu, congrats on living in the first major US cities to return to the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.

If you’re dealing with $7 orange juice like the rest of us, there’s still reason to be cautiously optimistic. Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May, and the closely watched measure of inflation showed that consumer prices rose 4% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86Q?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4fd07021cf83> annually last month, less than half of the rate of peak inflation in June 2022.

While prices are still rising briskly in certain sectors of the economy, the overall report was a hopeful sign that our long inflation horror story could be entering its final chapters.

4 key takeaways from the report

1. Energy is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Cheaper energy played a major role <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86R?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b6806bc4bef9> in pulling inflation down to 4% last month from 4.9% in April, per Axios. Gas prices plunged almost 20% from last year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fuel costs to the moon, while broader energy prices fell nearly 12%.

2. “Revenge spending” is down. Once pandemic lockdowns lifted, Americans splurged on vacations, leisure, and recreation (new pickleball paddles!) in what economists dubbed “revenge spending.” Now that everyone has taken their weeklong trip to Italy, there are signs that revenge spending is waning: Airfare prices dropped 13% annually in May and, according to the US Travel Association, hotel demand is below 2019 levels. Bad for your Insta, but good for inflation.

3. Food prices are up. The cost of food ticked up 0.2% in May from April after staying flat in the previous two months, showing how inflation has persisted on grocery store shelves. But not all aisles are created equal—the price of eggs dropped nearly 14% from April (the biggest one-month drop since 1951), while fruit and veggie prices rose 1.3%.

4. More than anything else, rent is propping up inflation. Shelter costs are the largest category in the CPI report, and they’re still on the upward march, climbing 8.7% from a year earlier. The good news: Economists say this government data doesn’t reflect on-the-ground information, such as reports of softening rent by Zillow and Apartment List. Shelter costs in the CPI are expected to decline during the second half of the year.

Looking ahead…later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a pause in interest rate hikes after 10 consecutive increases. And, if inflation continues to drop like it did last month, he may not start up again <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86S?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ce4f718f73fb> anytime soon, analysts told Bloomberg.—CC

Donald Trump was arraigned in a Miami courthouse.

The indictment is the first time that a former president has been charged with federal crimes and marks the second time that Trump has been charged with crimes this year. Still the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, Trump later proclaimed his innocence in a speech from his golf course in New Jersey.

Instant Pot’s once-grand dreams of taking over your kitchen came out underdone. Its parent company, Instant Brands, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86-?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c2242a785052> Monday to get its battered finances in order.

Not long ago, Instant Pot devotees were compared to a cult. The easy-to-use pressure cooker exploded in popularity in 2016, speeding up stews and dominating cooking blogs pitching “65 easy Instant Pot recipes for quick weeknight dinners.” The Swiss Army knife of kitchen appliances regularly became a top seller on Amazon’s Prime Days.

In 2019, private equity firm Cornell Capital scooped up Instant Pot and plotted to grow its reach faster than the countertop hog could finish your carnitas.

But fly too close to the broiler, and you’re going to get burnt.

Hungry for expansion, Cornell pushed Instant Brands <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/86_?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=515d7ae5be74> to release new gadgets, like air fryers and an air purifier. Those flopped.

At the same time, sales of Instant Pot and its fellow multicookers fell by half from 2020 to 2022, according to NPD Group.

What happened? You can blame the device’s flameout on Covid-era supply chain snags, lower demand for lightning-quick meals as more people work from home, or the fact that “no product stays at a phenom level forever,” according to Instant Brands CEO Ben Gadbois.

Looking ahead...could air fryers be the next kitchen disruptor to stall out? Based on similarly cooling sales, possibly.—MM

A new Beatles track will drop this year with artificial intelligence joining the Fab Four on Abbey Road.

Yesterday, Paul McCartney told the BBC <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/874?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=55dca3630ebd> that AI helped him use a demo recording of John Lennon singing an unpublished song to create a last hurrah from the iconic band, which broke up more than 50 years ago.

Sir Paul did not reveal the name of the soon-to-be-released song, but fans are speculating that it’ll be “Now And Then,” one of the songs that Lennon recorded in the late ’70s on a cassette labeled “For Paul” that Yoko Ono gave to McCartney after her husband’s death.

So, how does this tech bring Lennon’s voice back to life?

McCartney said the AI was trained to recognize his bandmate’s voice and then used to separate it from background noise and instruments.

Key performance indicators <#> Chart of Pornhub traffic during the Champions League final Morning Brew
Stat: There are only a few things that can get people to stop thinking about sex, and one of them is sports. During the Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan on Saturday, traffic on Pornhub plunged 32% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/879?mbcid=31784997.98215&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f19534e5115> below average in Italy (then surged 17% in the hours after Inter lost), according to Pornhub Insights.

Good morning. This is news to us, but apparently Tuesday is the new Friday—at least in NYC. According to the NY Post, restaurant owners across the city are seeing a “seismic shift <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82M?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=12afbe93048e>” in Tuesday vibes as it moves from sleepy date night to full-on party mode.

At one midtown restaurant, diners are drinking 20% more wine on Tuesdays than on Fridays. At another spot, Tuesday is the busiest night of the week. And it’s not unheard of for people to make reservations two weeks ahead to eat out on a Tuesday.

So, just extrapolating here…if Tuesday is the new Friday, then Wednesday morning meetings are the new bottomless brunch.

Will the UK become a crypto hub? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83f?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Coin with British flag <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83f?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The UK seems poised to become the center of the famously decentralized crypto universe now that one of the world’s biggest venture capital firms is betting crypto pitches will land better with a cockney accent.

VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83g?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2a528d8abfb1> over the weekend its first office outside the US will be opened in London, where it plans to focus on blockchain investments. A16z cited UK authorities’ bullishness on Web3 as the reason for establishing its international outpost there.

Andreessen Horowitz also announced funding for the UK-based blockchain venture Gensyn—which is focused on AI development—and the VC firm’s plans to hold its annual crypto startup accelerator in London next year.

The UK offers clarity (for better view of the moon)

A16z said that “a clear regulatory regime” is essential to blockchain innovation and the UK aims to provide just that. Its government recently unveiled plans to come up with comprehensive crypto rules that protect consumers and incentivize innovation.

It starts at the top:

It was clear that now-UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was on the blockchain bandwagon when last year, as chancellor of the exchequer, he told Morning Brew that he looks at and follows NFTs of “dumb monkeys.” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83h?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8071aa1b224b>

He’s since talked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/83i?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=73965edcf6a7> about turning the country into a global hub for crypto and pushed to make stablecoins (e.g., crypto pegged to a traditional currency) legal tender.

Meanwhile, US authorities have made it clear that the sheriff has come to town for some litigation-based regulation of an industry that’s often compared to the Wild West. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (the latter of which is an a16z portfolio company) last week in cases that could imperil their stateside future.

Best of all, the engine is compatible with a variety of fuels, including hydrogen. This could unlock a 100% green energy solution for the combustion engine market.

JPMorgan agrees to pay Epstein victims $290 million. The bank, which counted the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as a client between 1998 and 2013, has reached a deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82O?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=559834a41efd> to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of women Epstein sexually abused or trafficked that claims it ignored red flags. The deal comes after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was deposed in the suit. If the judge approves the settlement, it won’t totally wipe out JPMorgan’s Epstein-related headaches: The bank is still facing a suit from the US Virgin Islands. Deutsche Bank settled a similar lawsuit last month for $75 million.

Gen Z came to court to slay yesterday as the trial kicked off in a landmark lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82R?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a54993284975> brought by young people in Montana who claim inaction on climate change has violated their right to “a clean and healthful environment,” which is guaranteed by the state’s constitution.

The lawsuit, lodged by 16 young Montanans in March 2020, marks the first time a US youth climate case has made it to open court. The group representing the plaintiffs has filed one in all 50 states, but most have been dismissed before making it to trial—though a high-profile case against the federal government also recently got the green light to move forward toward a trial.

During the two-week trial, the plaintiffs, age 5 through 22, will argue that because of the state’s fossil fuel-friendly stance (Montana is a major coal exporter), they’ve been harmed by side effects of a warming planet like heat, drought, and wildfire smoke. The state will retort its contributions to the problem were minor.

Looking ahead…a win for the young people probably won’t lead to any immediate changes in Montana’s energy policy and would most likely be appealed—but the case could still provide an important precedent for how courts handle similar claims.—AR

A California family is selling what they estimate to be one million copper pennies they found in a late relative’s basement crawl space.

Worth $10,000 at face value, the coins are being priced at more than double because they might contain rare finds worth a small fortune, according to the sellers. The family listed the copper pennies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/82W?mbcid=31771673.2843920&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=81cf604dda5b> on OfferUp for $25,000 after local bank branches told them they didn’t have room to hold the thousands of pounds of Abe Lincolns.

Pennies were all copper until 1943, when the material demands of World War II prompted the United States Mint to switch over to zinc-coated steel. A few dozen copper pennies were accidentally made that year, and one of them sold for $300,000 at auction in 2022.

By 1982, new pennies were made almost entirely of zinc. The family says that’s when their relative began buying up old copper ones to build wealth for future generations. There’s more than two cents’ worth of copper in each pre-1982 penny.

A penny earned: The family isn’t interested in scouring their two truckloads of pennies for treasure—they just want to sell them to a patient someone who’s willing to schlep. As of yesterday, they had around 300 offers, the New York Times reported.—ML

Good morning. You come across a lot of weird headlines in this job, but “Conor McGregor sends the Heat mascot to ER” in The Athletic is among the strangest.

During the NBA Finals game Friday night, the former UFC champ clocked the Miami Heat’s mascot, Burnie, twice as part of a choreographed bit to promote McGregor’s pain relief spray. But apparently he forgot he was an elite mixed martial artist, because he punched the man who plays Burnie so hard that the poor guy had to be briefly treated in the hospital (he’s fine now).

UFC President Dana White said having a pro fighter punch a mascot “doesn’t seem like the brightest thing in the world.”

You’ll need to find a site other than Reddit to distract you from work today, because thousands of subreddits are going dark <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-x?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=950a677be871> in protest of the company’s recent API updates.

Nearly 3,500 subreddits will be inaccessible for the next 48 hours and perhaps much longer, according to the BBC. The protest includes five of the 10 most popular forums, such as r/gaming, r/aww, and r/todayilearned.

What are they protesting?

In April, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company would begin to charge for access <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5nk?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41ebfb96b8d4> to its application programming interface (API), which allows third-party developers to tap into Reddit’s vast trove of data to build their own apps or train AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

Huffman told the NYT that this data is valuable and that it doesn’t make business sense to keep giving it away for free. (Elon Musk made a similar decision at Twitter earlier this year, revoking free API access and introducing paid tiers.)

But it’s being called way too expensive

Key players in the Reddit ecosystem say they can’t afford to pay for API access and will need to shut down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-y?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=adfd854917b9>, sparking outrage toward Reddit’s leadership.

Who are these key players? Third-party Reddit apps.

If you’re not deep in the Reddit world, you might not know that many users consume Reddit not through Reddit’s official app, but through third-party apps that use Reddit’s API.

These apps show Reddit content but aim to improve the site’s famously janky user experience by adding features like customizable gestures and an easier-to-read comments layout.

And the new pricing plan would put them out of business. The developer behind the most-used Reddit app, Apollo, shocked the internet when he wrote that Reddit’s new API pricing would cost him $20 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-z?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a2c551185e63> per year to keep operating the app. Unable to afford that, Apollo and other third-party Reddit apps will shut down on June 30, the day before the pricing plan goes into effect.

Big picture: Reddit’s push to monetize its API right now is not a coincidence—the company is planning to IPO this year, and adding a new revenue stream could boost its valuation before hitting the public markets. But by trying to beef up its stats line, Reddit has lost the trust of its most engaged users.

One of the most notorious American criminals of the 20th century, Ted Kaczynski, died by suicide <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-I?mbcid=31761151.2872761&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26c8eb42df23> on Saturday in prison at 81 years old, the AP reported.

Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, was a convicted terrorist who orchestrated a bombing campaign from his shack in Montana, eluding authorities for nearly two decades. From 1978–1995, Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 using homemade pipe bombs that unleashed nails and razor blades on his victims. The FBI gave him the nickname the Unabomber because he targeted universities and airlines.

Kaczynski’s reign of terror gripped the world—not only because of his grisly crimes, but because of why he purportedly did them. A Harvard-trained math prodigy, Kaczynski came to reject technology and science and claimed that humans were slaves to machines.

But his urge to share his anti-tech beliefs with the world ultimately led him to be caught. After the Washington Post and the New York Times published the Unabomber’s manifesto in 1995 at the request of the FBI, Kaczynski’s brother recognized his writing style and tipped off authorities.

  Photo of the week <#> A diablo IV poster shown in NYC while smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed the city @Nick_Newman on Twitter This billboard in New York City promoting the release of the Diablo IV video game was maybe a little too spot-on, when smoke from Canadian wildfires turned Northeastern cities into hellscapes.

Lulu Cheng Meservey, an exec at Diablo-maker Activision Blizzard, denied <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7X-?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=767d0c328907> that the wildfire smoke was an elaborate marketing stunt. “I would like to clarify that Blizzard has no affiliation or partnership with the wildfires in Canada. In fact we are firmly against wildfires and condemn them in the strongest terms,” she tweeted.

  Dept. of Progress <#> Hey Arnold saying Hey Arnold!/Paramount Global Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even eat a meal prepared by a robot.

Robots learned how to make salads through observation. Get the Kardashians in here because a robot just made some salads. Researchers from the University of Cambridge programmed what looks like a bionic arm with eight simple salad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7X_?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fb793d473247> recipes that it was able to identify and recreate by watching video footage of a human chef making them. The robot also picked up on a new recipe just from observation and noticed double portions and human errors, too, according to the researchers. This development shows how video could make automated food production easier and cheaper.

Uncovered burials set the record for most ancient funeral. New excavations of South African caves revealed that extinct apelike human relatives were burying their dead at least 100,000 years before Homo sapiens held what were previously thought to be the first funerals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y0?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d431f94e2418>. The research team that discovered the symbol-engraved burial sites of Homo naledi—a smaller-brained precursor to Homo sapiens—say this could change our understanding of human evolution. Scientists previously thought funerals were exclusively a big-brain behavior.

A female croc “virgin” birthed a baby. Ladies, we’re getting closer: Scientists just confirmed that a female crocodile in Costa Rica gave birth to a 99.9% genetically identical offspring after being in captivity without males for about 16 years. Self-reproduction or “virgin births”—scientifically known as facultative parthenogenesis—have been observed in some birds, fish, and other reptiles, but this is a first for crocs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y1?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=41a4fe3f6ca8>. The fully formed fetus, laid in an egg in 2018, was unfortunately stillborn, but this is still a big discovery that suggests some dinosaur ancestors might also have been able to self-reproduce.—ML

  Saudi’s ambitions are much bigger than golf <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-o?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a LIV golfer walks up to the green <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7-o?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Chris Trotman/LIV Golf/Getty Images The Gulf State became the Golf State this week as the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league merged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7MI?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5959beff6f64> with the PGA Tour. Pro golf will now be synonymous with a new joint venture bankrolled by the Saudi government’s massive piggy bank, the $650 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF).

But what amounts to a purchase of an entire sport is not a one-off impulse buy: The oil-rich kingdom is splurging to style itself as the ultimate hub for elite sports, world-class art, and luxury leisure.

All these investments are part of Vision 2030, an effort by the country’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka “MBS”), to diversify its fossil fuel-dependent economy. And a major prong of the plan is convincing the world that Saudi is no longer an ultraconservative theocracy.

Where’s all the cash going?

Most notably, Saudi is going all-out to achieve sports superpower status.

* Cristiano Ronaldo is already scoring for Al Nassr FC in Riyadh, while legendary French striker Karim Benzema recently announced he’d also join the Saudi Pro League.

* Beginning in 2021, Formula 1 stars started competing annually at a state-of-the-art racetrack in Jeddah for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

And it wants more: The kingdom is reportedly eyeing investments in boxing and cricket. Meanwhile, some speculate it could come for the NBA (which recently allowed sovereign fund investments) or even the NFL (which currently forbids foreign ownership).

It’s not neglecting the arts either: Saudi is hosting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YQ?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7c94b33b6fae> an Andy Warhol exhibition in the desert this year, and plans to build a contemporary art museum in partnership with the world-renowned Paris-based Centre Pompidou.

Both cinemas and music festivals were banned there until 2017, but last year it hosted the star-studded Red Sea International Film Festival featuring some LGBTQ programming (while it still outlaws homosexuality). The same month, Post Malone and Bruno Mars performed in front of raving crowds at the Soundstorm music festival <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YR?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8291f9acd45f>.

But it remains to be seen if the image rehab will work

Experts say that the glamour of its cultural calendar is meant to distract from the fact that Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with abysmal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YS?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5ecd02f1f75c> women’s rights, virtually non-existent religious freedom, and troublesome labor practices that one human rights advocate described <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YT?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4abfe6f77bb8> as “modern-day slavery.”

The entertainment glow up is intended to appease critics at home and abroad. Geopolitical risk consultant Sami Hamdi told Morning Brew he sees it as a way to buy the loyalty of the nation’s youth. He describes it as a social contract between MBS and Saudis, which Hamdi calls “a simple one: ‘I will let you party… I’ll let you wear a bikini on a beach. But in exchange, you will not ask me for civil rights.’”

Foreigners might still be wary

For companies doing business in Saudi Arabia, Hamdi warns that besides the obvious reputational risk, there are also issues with transparency and the rule of law. He says that for companies starting projects there, “the position of their [local business] partner within the political structure of Saudi Arabia” means more than official regulations.

And even all those billions might not convince elites Saudi Arabia is truly the place to be. It’s rumored that Lionel Messi’s wife’s reluctance to move to a country that only recently allowed women to drive was a factor in his decision to reject an eye-popping offer from a Saudi team.

Looking ahead…despite the kingdom’s apparently bottomless pockets, it might eventually run out of cash for shiny-toy projects. Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld pointed out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7YU?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a58eadb4abe2> that the price of oil (its main export) has declined and that some of MBS’s other big investments haven’t panned out.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Colorado’s most famous Mexican restaurant <#> Casa Bonita Hyoung Chang/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

A shuttered Colorado restaurant featured in a 2003 episode of South Park is getting a revival thanks to…the creators of South Park.

Casa Bonita was a beloved Mexican restaurant in the Denver area that went bankrupt during the pandemic. But Colorado natives Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the duo behind South Park, knew this place was too special to gather cobwebs. So, in 2021, they paid $3.1 million to buy Casa Bonita, and then spent up to $40 million (!) renovating it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y3?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc38a14ecd89> ahead of its reopening, which is set to happen in the next few weeks, the NYT reported.

What made Casa Bonita so iconic? It certainly wasn’t the food, which diners often complained about (there were no ovens or ranges in the antiquated kitchen, so every dish was steamed, Stone told the NYT).

But the entertainment value more than made up for the rubbery pollo. Casa Bonita was a kid’s version of Las Vegas: It had a maze patrolled by skeletons, puppet shows, and divers plunging into a pool every 20 minutes. South Park captured the chaos in an episode <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y4?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a90d22549973> from its seventh season centered around Casa Bonita.

In their renovation of the restaurant, Parker and Stone tried to keep as much of the original kitsch intact while upping the food quality. They’ve hired a six-time James Beard Award-nominated chef, Dana Rodriguez, to run a 110-person kitchen and reimagine the menu.

Who knows whether the South Park guys will ever recoup their $40 million, but the hype for Casa Bonita 2.0 is off the charts: More than 100,000 people have signed up on its website for a reservation. You can get in line here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Y5?mbcid=31748165.3251675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ba0fbcf64b58>.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the most niche theme for a party you’ve been to or thrown? Here are our favorite responses.

* “I’m currently planning a soup party with a ‘New York Stock Exchange’ theme where everyone must dress like a stockbroker and bring their best soup stocks (chicken, beef, veggie, etc.) to trade.”—Justin from Brooklyn, NY

* “My older sister hosted a funeral for her car that had been destroyed by rats. Everyone dressed for a funeral and brought their favorite road trip snacks as they mourned ‘Frank the Sonata.’ She printed out pictures of famous rats (like Remy from Ratatouille) and X’ed out their eyes in solidarity with the car.”—Emme from San Antonio, TX

* “My aunt and I share a birthday, and we just happened to turn 64 and 27 the same year. That year we had a cube-themed party with foods served in cube shapes.”—James from Washington, DC

* “A group of my college friends hosted an organ donor-themed party. There were no costumes, decorations, or anything special, but a person at the door checked IDs to see if you were an organ donor. If you were, you got a $5 keg cup and walked in. If you weren’t, you were questioned about why you didn’t sign up to be an organ donor when you got your driver’s license, had to pay double, and also had to swear you would sign up to be an organ donor.”—Anonymous

How Tesla won the US charging race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZL?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tesla charger with green upwards arrow going through it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZL?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Tesla will soon be serving up voltage to more non-Tesla drivers. And, thanks to recent deals with other automakers, the shape of its charging plug might soon dominate the US EV market.

This week, GM and Tesla announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZM?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fb67a92a0b0d> they agreed to a deal that will allow GM EVs to get juiced up by 12,000 fast chargers in Tesla’s sprawling network of charging stations. The partnership follows a similar agreement reached with Ford last month, making Tesla look like it’s in charge of charging.

Its charger network is the biggest of any EV-maker in the US, boasting 20,000 fast chargers in 1,800 spots nationwide, but it wasn’t necessarily obvious that Tesla would become the charging standard-bearer.

The company took a major gamble when it decided to make its charging system incompatible with other EVs that use the biggest competing standard, the Combined Charging System (CCS).

But now analysts say other automakers are likely to follow in GM’s and Ford’s footsteps to design EVs using Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS).

Tesla’s standard is set to become the industry standard, since the deals mean the top three EV producers (which currently account for ~70% of US EV sales) all use it.

Tesla won’t be charging free of charge: The GM and Ford partnerships will help it rake in an additional $5.4 billion in annual revenue by 2032, according to a Piper Sandler estimate. And in more good news for the EV giant, the White House said yesterday that Tesla can receive government subsidies to build more charging stations if they include CCS adapters so other EVs can use them, too.

Tesla is on a roll…its stock climbed 27% over the past two weeks, (losing short sellers over $6 billion, according to S3 Partners). In addition to the Ford and GM deals, investors are charged up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZN?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=90e9627da78f> about rumors that the company plans to ship more Cybertrucks than predicted.—SK

It alleges Donald Trump kept boxes of documents in a bathroom and on a ballroom stage at Mar-a-Lago and that he twice showed secret information to people who did not have security clearances (once while noting that he was no longer able to declassify documents). Trump, who denies doing anything wrong, is expected to appear in court Tuesday before Aileen Cannon, a judge he appointed and who ruled in his favor on issues earlier in the case. A Trump aide was also indicted.

Netflix subscriptions jump after password-sharing crackdown.

Netflix added 100k US subscribers on each of two days after enforcing the new rules.

The children, who ranged from an infant to a 13-year-old, survived the May 1 Cessna crash that killed their mother and the two other adults on the aircraft and had been wandering in the Amazon jungle ever since. They were evacuated for medical care after being found by an intensive military-led search that also involved scouts from the local indigenous community.

Teens who loiter in parking lots and slam six energy drinks before 9am might live forever. The amino acid taurine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZU?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0ab2ae2155a8>, which is found in meats, seafood, and energy drinks, could be the magic elixir of living longer.

Researchers fed high concentrations of taurine to mice, monkeys, and worms and published their promising results Thursday in the journal Science. All groups receiving the extra taurine were healthier and lived longer: Mice taking the supplement lived about 10%–12% longer than the control group and had higher muscle endurance.

How does it work? Scientists don’t yet know whether humans will see similar results, but they think that supplementing with amino acid, which you naturally produce less of as you age, may delay the health issues that come with aging.

There's a lot of caveats. For starters, the animals were given huge doses of taurine relative to their body weight. For a human to take that level exclusively from energy drinks, they’d have to drink about 63 cans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7ZV?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=02bdb3b30a02> of Monster…per day, according to the BBC.

If you often shake your fist at society’s downward spiral into an immoral hellscape, you’re not alone—but a new study says you might be wrong.

Over the past 70 years, survey respondents worldwide have consistently said they think humanity is experiencing a decline in kindness, honesty, and other values—but a peer-reviewed study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Z-?mbcid=31751461.97675&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3d2215332c69> published by Nature this week asserts that this perceived moral decay is just an illusion.

The vast majority of 220,000 Americans surveyed between 1949 and 2019 said the state of moral values was worse at the time of being surveyed than it was before. Similar polling in 59 other countries had pretty much the same results, according to the study.

But over the same period, there’s been no decline in positive answers to questions like “Were you treated with respect all day yesterday?” Some respondents even said the people in their social circles showed moral improvements between 2005 and 2020.

So, why do we yearn for the supposed good ol’ days? One theory attributes it to the brain’s rose-colored tendencies when reminiscing about the past. Our habit of focusing on bad stuff in the present, likely aided by mass media covering more bad news than good, could also be to blame.—ML

Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told CNBC the company expects fewer people to put a ring on it this year because it typically takes consumers three-and-a-quarter years to get from the first date to the proposal—and people weren’t meeting each other during lockdowns. As a result, the company predicts 2.4 million engagements this year instead of 2.8 million, before picking back up in the future, Drosos said.

Good morning. Some trips to Miami come with Apple and Adidas profit-sharing; others come with a judge reading out criminal charges against you.

Former President Trump said last night that he’d been indicted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7VM?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f155cd11b4ca> over his mishandling of classified documents and was summoned to appear in a Miami courthouse Tuesday afternoon. The DOJ did not comment, but sources confirmed to multiple news outlets that Trump’s indictment contained at least seven charges.

This marks the first time a former president has faced federal criminal charges; about two months ago, Trump was charged with falsifying business records in New York—also a first for a former president.

Despite his deepening legal troubles, Trump remains the front-runner to get the GOP nomination for the 2024 presidential election. And he started a fresh fundraising campaign within 20 minutes of announcing he’d been indicted...

From prodding gently to making straight-up threats, large companies are pulling out all the tricks to get employees back in the office.

On Wednesday, Google warned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7V8?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=35a6b3bb86ea> workers that if they didn’t abide by the company’s three-day in-office requirement, it would be noted in their performance reviews, CNBC reported. Google’s chief people officer told staff via email, “There’s just no substitute for coming together in person,” despite the company famously developing an entire suite of products to, in fact, not come together in person.

Plus, there’s a whole lot of drama at the insurer Farmers Group, the WSJ reported. Last year, its CEO informed employees that WFH was permanent. But a new guy, Raul Vargas, took over the position and last month said actually, never mind. Vargas told staff that in order to foster “collaboration, creativity, and innovation,” workers needed to be back in the office at least three days a week.

Employees revolted

Farmers Group staff raged on an internal communication site, according to the WSJ, saying they’d made huge lifestyle changes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7V9?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=32ee8aea3dfe> (like moving to new cities and ditching their cars), thinking they would get to work from their living rooms forever. Some threatened to quit, and others suggested unionizing.

Return-to-office mandates have not gone over well at other companies, either.

SCOTUS hands win to Alabama’s Black voters and bolsters voting rights law.

That map was accused of denying Black Alabamians fair representation because while Black people account for more than 25% of the state’s population, they were the majority in only one of Alabama’s seven congressional districts. The Supreme Court ordered the state to create a new map, but Alabama’s GOP attorney general said he will fight to keep it intact.

Ron DeSantis’s campaign released several images on Twitter that show DeSantis’s rival, Donald Trump, hugging and kissing Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Just Finnish things: reindeer, Nokia, and $130k speeding tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vq?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Digital speed sign that says "YOUR SPEED" and Euro symbol <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vq?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
On Sunday, a man in Finland was fined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vr?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2572792e3914> €121,000 (~$130,000) for going ~20 mph over the speed limit.

Before you decide to never rent a car in Helsinki, know two things: 1) it’s really the best way to explore the Lapland countryside and 2) speeding tickets in Finland are calculated based on income.

It’s called the “day fine” system, wherein half of the offender’s daily income is multiplied by a certain number of days, which increases according to the severity of the offense. And the driver hit with the six-figure fine has a fairly large daily income—it was Anders Wiklöf, founder of the multimillion-dollar Wiklöf Holding company and one of Finland’s richest people.

Finland established its day fine system in 1921, and other countries have adopted it since, including Switzerland, which is far from neutral when it comes to the rules of the road.

Stat: Whether they’re opting for shroom chocolates or just being hangover-conscious, Gen Z is buying noticeably less alcohol <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Vw?mbcid=31739241.2857568&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8681e1518818> at concerts, Billboard reported. One club owner in Tucson, AZ, told the outlet that at every event aimed at Gen Z, alcohol sales fell by as much as 25% compared to concerts for older folks. While that may be a hopeful sign for society, it’s a sobering development for smaller venues that need to make up lost revenue.

If Mark Zuckerberg is worried about Apple’s new headset treading onto Meta’s turf, he didn’t show it.

While Meta wants to emphasize social connection and activity, “every demo that [Apple] showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself,” Zuck argued. Plus, he added, Meta’s headset is seven times cheaper than Apple’s.

With no end in sight to the Canada wildfires that are blanketing the Eastern half of the US in smoke, American air quality is literally at the mercy of the wind.

Breathing is supposed to stay rough today in many already badly smogged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QR?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cf2bebecef4b> parts of the Northeast, as well as in cities further down the East Coast thanks to a low-pressure system with south-blowing winds that aren’t expected to change course until at least Saturday. Once they do, outside will look a lot less like Mars, but it’s still likely to be a hazy weekend for the greater New York, Pittsburgh, Philly, and DC areas, where people have been inhaling some of the most toxic air in the world.

The pollution has already caused flight delays, the postponement of the Yankees–White Sox game, and raids on everyone’s Covid mask stashes. Record-high air quality indexes are far above the “unhealthy” threshold of 100 (NYC surpassed 400 yesterday).

How to stay safe from the smoke

Health officials recommend that everyone...

Stay inside with windows and doors shut. Close the fireplace flue if you’re fancy, and if you have a window AC unit, the Environmental Protection Agency suggests only using it if you can seal up window frame gaps and close the outdoor air damper.

If you have central air, the EPA recommends keeping it running. If it has a fresh air setting, switch it to recirculation mode. Get some fans going, and consider buying an air purifier before they sell out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QS?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=66c17f403aae>.

Avoid frying food, doing strenuous activity, taking the dog for long walks, and smokin’ darts…even if half a pack of cigarettes is less harmful than a full day of Northeast air right now.

Looking ahead…Canada says this could be its most destructive wildfire season ever, which would make for a smoky American summer and a She’s-All-That comeback story for people who got bullied for buying those Dyson air purifier headsets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QT?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=640737f5a6ba>. While air quality over the next few days is projected to be less than good, wildfire smoke is notoriously hard to predict, so keep an eye on live forecasts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7QU?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ada499439bba>.—ML

His brief time at the helm included plenty of controversies, including a recent unflattering profile in The Atlantic, pushback from staff on the handling of the Donald Trump town hall, and the layoffs that came with killing the network’s attempt at a streamer. Ratings and profits also fell during his tenure. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav took responsibility for the situation and put three execs in charge while he searches for a permanent replacement.

But investors weren’t impressed—they may have noticed that the company also announced that its revenue was down last quarter compared to a year before—sending the volatile stock plunging in after-hours trading.

Bienvenido a Miami, Messi <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Q-?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Lionel Messi in Inter Miami pink jersey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Q-?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo: Getty Images, Editing: Morning Brew
On Wednesday, Lionel Messi decided to wear pink. The Argentinian champ announced yesterday that he’s joining Inter Miami in a deal poised to change the future of US soccer.

For Messi to turn down a reported $400 million offer from the Saudi football league, Miami’s proposition had to be sweeter than a Barefoot moscato. According to The Athletic, key aspects of the deal helped bring Messi stateside.

Partnerships with Apple and Adidas: In addition to his salary, Messi will receive a cut of the revenue from new subscribers to Apple’s MLS Season Pass, and a profit-sharing agreement between him and Adidas is in the works.

Bend it like Messi: He’ll likely have a chance to buy a stake in an MLS team when he’s done playing, echoing the deal that Becks got when he joined LA Galaxy (which ultimately led to him co-owning Inter Miami).

Even after securing the biggest name in the sport, US fútbol has a long way to go. But the future looks promising: Ticket sales for the Inter Miami vs. LAFC match on Sept. 3 jumped from $81 to $422 following Messi’s announcement, per TickPick.

Zoom out: Miami sports fans haven’t had it this good since 1972. The city has a team in both the NBA and NHL championships and will also be a host for the 2026 World Cup.—CC

Covid scientists search for Ohio pooper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R2?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Covid virus in toilet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R2?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Someone has been pooping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R3?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=86924c68a793> out the same Covid strain for two years in Ohio and we need to find them. There’s nothing to be concerned about (unless it’s your poop) since the virus is inactive in waste, but scientists believe finding that person could provide some much-needed insight into the disease.

Dr. Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of Missouri medical school and head of Missouri’s wastewater sampling program, noticed that a “cryptic” strain (meaning it’s a highly specific mutation) keeps popping up in the area.

He hypothesized that it’s coming from just one person.

Based on sewage lines, he’s even pinpointed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R4?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7f6b1bc2ac2c> that the individual’s home is likely in Columbus, OH, and that they commute to work in a city called Washington Court House about 45 minutes away.

Everybody (with Covid) poops: And the virus is shed in their waste. So, sewage tracking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7R5?mbcid=31725987.1875893&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=59f627c33425>, while spotty around the country, remains one of the most reliable and up-to-date ways to track Covid infections in communities—especially as the US starts to shutter other community-level tracking programs.

So, why is one person’s bathroom break so important? Well, for starters, they are likely really sick and might not even know it. And, number two, studying this mystery person might be able to help scientists better understand why long-Covid infections happen and how to treat them.—MM

Good morning on the 79th anniversary of D-Day. A day before the invasion of Normandy, General Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a famous speech in which he told the troops, “The eyes of the world are upon you.”

Less known is an alternate speech Eisenhower wrote in case the invasion was unsuccessful. In what would later become one of the world's most coveted pieces of scrap paper, the general wrote, “My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. The troops, the air, and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.”

Maybe something to think about next time something goes wrong on your watch.

Apple has finally sprung its long-awaited cannonball into the augmented reality space, and it could revolutionize the industry—or flop hard.

To many gasps, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7IB?mbcid=31700007.2865009&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4a249bd3ae3b> the $3,499 Vision Pro yesterday at the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The presentation claimed the mixed-reality headset—meaning it accommodates both AR and VR—will be the “most advanced personal electronics device ever.”.

Apple is positioning the headset to replace desktop computer-cluttered workspaces with an “infinite canvas” of virtual screens that hover in the field of view. Users can navigate with just their eyes, hands (no clunky controllers!), and voice.

The Vision Pro boasts an enormous virtual screen through lenses with “more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.” A new feature called EyeSight will keep users’ eyes visible through the display most of the time.

Disney CEO Bob Iger guest-starred to tease immersive experiences like watching Star Wars content while on one of the franchise’s planets. Users will also be able to play more than 100 Apple Arcade titles on Day One.

Will the Vision Pro live up to the hype?

While some believe the Vision Pro will be the iPhone of mixed-reality headsets, others aren’t so sure, considering how existing competitors have done so far.

As of March, Meta—the current industry big dog—had sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets. While they’re much cheaper and the brand has a head start, less than half of Quests were still being used six months after purchase, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Microsoft’s HoloLens headset (the newer model of which also costs $3,500) has only sold about 300,000 units since its 2016 launch.

So, why might this be different? Short answer: Apple is cool—they’re good at revamping existing markets with reinvented products. But consumers will have to wait until the Vision Pro hits shelves early next year to see if they really want to strap a screen to their faces.—ML

SCOTUS will mull “Trump too small” trademark.

While the phrase stems from a slightly racy joke Sen. Marco Rubio made about Donald Trump’s hands during the 2016 primary, the issue before the court is serious. The government asserts the trademark is not allowed because trademarks involving the names of living individuals are not permitted without their written consent. The trademark seeker claims that applying this rule would make it “virtually impossible” to register a trademark that opines on a public figure.

The government accused Hanssen of trading highly classified information from his counterintelligence roles to Moscow for $1.4 million in cash and diamonds. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 after pleading guilty to espionage. He began spying in 1979, three years after he joined the FBI, and claimed he had planned on it since he was a teenager.

Dogged JDs wanted at the world’s largest crypto exchange: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7II?mbcid=31700007.2865009&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3c09dd9e06e1> Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, yesterday.

The suit comes as US regulators adopt a no-more-crypto-monkey-business attitude after the collapse of former rival exchange FTX.

The agency alleges Binance funneled customer funds to a third-party company controlled by Zhao to inflate trade volumes, misled investors about the platform’s anti-market manipulation safeguards, and operated an illegal securities exchange in the US.

Binance was barred from working with Americans directly due to the riskiness of its investment offerings, so its US-based affiliate Binance.US was supposed to be independent. But the SEC claims it wasn’t really independent at all and that it bypassed regulations allowing American clients to trade on Binance’s international platform.

Binance asserts there was no need to go to court and accused regulators of failing to clearly articulate rules for the crypto industry. But it might have a hard time proving its executives were ignorant of wrongdoing: The SEC claims Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer sent this message to a coworker in 2018: “we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.”

Zoom out: Binance is also facing a Justice Department investigation over alleged money laundering, and a civil lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.—SK

Good morning. For the US Postal Service, your dog protecting its home turf against their mail carriers is no joke. This weekend it kicked off National Dog Bite Awareness Week to…raise awareness around aggressive dogs going after the people who deliver your mail. The USPS said that last year dogs attacked more than 5,300 of its employees while delivering the mail, with Houston, LA, Dallas, and Cleveland recording the most incidents.

Sonic boom from fighter jets rocks DC. People around the nation’s capital were shocked to hear a mysterious “boom” sound <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Fe?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3b4957ed9efc> yesterday at about 3:10 yesterday afternoon. Turns out the source was F-16 fighter jets sent from Joint Base Andrews intercepting a Cessna aircraft that was not responsive. That private plane crashed in central Virginia about 20 minutes after the boom was heard. Authorities do not yet know why the plane was unresponsive or how many people were on board.

Signal error blamed for Indian rail disaster. The devastating crash that killed 275 people and injured hundreds more was caused by an error in the electronic signal system <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ff?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=39869092745a>, officials said. The system mistakenly guided a passenger train to travel along a track that made it collide with a freight train, and derailed cars from that passenger train rolled over to another track, causing another passenger train to derail. India will conduct a full investigation into how this happened, and the stakes are high: About 22 million people ride trains in India per day, according to the AP.

It might not stop there: On Friday, another parent from the same school district issued a complaint about the Book of Mormon, which is the text of Utah’s own Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Last year, the state’s GOP government passed a law that bans “pornographic or indecent” books in schools.

AI: The labor deal asserts that generative AI is not a person (huge) and that it cannot replace guild members’ responsibilities.

Gun safety: The contract bans live ammunition on set following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during the filming of Rust in 2021.

Residuals: Foreign residuals—a type of royalty that’s been eroded in the streaming era—will get a 76% bump for the biggest streaming services.

The Guild and its negotiating leaders framed the contract as a big win <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Fl?mbcid=31689542.97791&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=24dffab5cf91> for directors that gives them “unprecedented gains.” The union members will show whether they agree when they vote on the proposed contract tomorrow.

Big picture: The agreement with the directors resolves just one of three high-stakes labor negotiations going on in Hollywood right now. As you know, more than 11,000 writers have been striking for five weeks, and actors will also vote on whether to authorize a strike by 5pm PT today.

Swift announced on Friday that she’s adding shows in Latin America to her Eras Tour, and in Buenos Aires, where inflation is raging at more than 100%, some standing room only tickets are going for about $153, per Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the cheapest ticket on SeatGeek for Swift’s LA shows in August is more than $1,500. With round-trip plane tickets from LAX to Buenos Aires at ~$800 in November, the math kinda checks out.

As of April, half as many new posts were getting 10+ million views as in February 2022, when the app hit a peak of 9,259 viral videos per week. It could be because the app’s user base grew from 1 billion near the end of 2021 to 1.6 billion this past March, ushering in a slate of new influencers to compete for eyeballs with dominant OGs like Charli D’Amelio. But smaller creators are getting squeezed, too. Average views on lesser-seen TikToks have also declined since December.

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Do SNAP work requirements...work? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dd?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A person holding an empty wallet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dd?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images The ancient adage “those who don’t work, won’t eat” sounds like the inspo behind a new US law.

Older low-income people will now have to get employed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7De?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=063ae20511ed> in order to receive government food assistance as part of the debt ceiling agreement that President Biden signed this week.

The deal raises the age cutoff for work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from 50 to 54. Adults younger than 54 without disabilities and with no dependents must work at least 80 hours a month to get long-term SNAP benefits.

That would appear to be a win for Republicans, who pushed for more work requirements to cut government spending and incentivize people to get jobs. But, according to a surprise finding from the Congressional Budget Office, the deal will actually cause the government to spend more on food aid since the legislation also expands SNAP access for jobless unhoused people, veterans, and young adults who were in foster care.

The wrangling over the work requirements and subsequent questions about just how much the government will save reopened the decadeslong debate over whether a no-free-lunch-for-the-jobless policy actually boosts economic self-reliance. In short, do work requirements work?

The grind-to-eat mindset

The conservative think tank Foundation For Government Accountability claims that doling out help without strings attached “traps people in government dependency.” It recommends adding universal work requirements to poverty aid programs, arguing the measures would boost the economy by spurring folks into job-seeking action and alleviating labor shortages.

“Let’s help people get lifted out of poverty into jobs,” said House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as he promoted work requirements for government aid last month.

But economists say the numbers don’t add up

Though quality data on the subject is hard to come by, many researchers say that having a job as a prerequisite for getting food from Uncle Sam doesn’t necessarily motivate people to start beefing up their resume. Work requirements for SNAP had no effect on employment among recipients, according to a 2021 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Df?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=cac101aa8ff2>. SNAP work requirements reduced the number of people receiving food subsidies by more than 50%.

Work requirements for SNAP add cumbersome paperwork to the application process that can prevent people from accessing benefits, according to social safety net scholar Jason Cook at the University of Utah. His latest research suggests <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Dg?mbcid=31676101.3263933&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=bc40b0dee461> some people do end up working less for a short time after getting on SNAP, but that’s likely because they’re using that time to search for a better job.

Economist Elena Prager, who co-authored the NBER study, told Morning Brew that people aren’t jobless because they are choosing to freeload off SNAP instead. She blames challenges like “homelessness, undocumented disability, or lack of access to transit” for keeping folks out of the workforce. Prager says there’s evidence that subsidizing the income of low-wage workers could be a better way to nudge more people to work.

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Apple Park <#> Apple's Cupertino campus Anadolu Agency/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Tomorrow, Apple is expected to announce its biggest product launch in almost 10 years—a mixed-reality headset—at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.

You may recognize the city of Cupertino from your iPhone’s weather app, but you’re probably not as familiar with Apple Park, the company’s global headquarters since 2017. So, let’s learn a little bit more about one of the most famous office buildings in the world.

Think of Apple Park as you would any other Apple product: sleek and extra at the same time. It was conceived of by co-founder Steve Jobs and meticulously laid out by Apple’s legendary chief designer, Jony Ive, in conjunction with the architectural firm Foster + Partners. Jobs even said the building’s circular shape “resembles the circular dial on an iPod” (but sadly without that clicking sound).

Let’s talk about the shape, because not many offices could be compared to a spaceship. Apple Park’s distinctive ring extends almost one mile in circumference, which is necessary because it’s built for over 12,000 employees to work there (more than the undergrad population of nearby Stanford). And the “walls” are walls in name only—the building is enclosed by towering curved glass pieces four stories high that can slide open when there’s good weather in Cupertino. And there’s typically good weather in Cupertino.

Unsurprisingly, Jobs’s most lasting imprint on the campus is the room that’s named after him: the Steve Jobs Theater. This 1,000-seat auditorium used for events and product launches is covered by the largest carbon-fiber roof in the world, according to its architects, and doesn’t have even one column holding it up.

Oh, and one more thing: Jk, you can move on to the next section.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the best car game to play during a long road trip? Here are our favorite responses.

* “Putting on the Now That’s What I Call Music Vol 1–50 playlist (a playlist of all the songs featured on Now CDs 1–50) on Spotify and having to guess the song and artist.”—Maria from Memphis, TN

* “In the UK, Pub Cricket. You get runs every time you see a pub based on how many legs the pub name has (e.g., ‘The Lion’ is four points). You are out when the pub has no legs (e.g., ‘The Crown’).”—Izzy from the UK

* “On our road trips, we stop at thrift stores. When in the thrift store, you must go to the CD section, close your eyes, and pick one. Then, we listen to it until our final destination.”—Christy from Auburn, CA

* “A conversation made up solely of song titles. Inane, but creatively fun.”—Cathy from CT

* “I have four kids and we’ve played the ‘Useless Superpowers’ game for years in the car. We all take turns coming up with the most unuseful superpower until we stop because everyone is laughing so hard. Our all-time favorite? ‘I can control inchworms!’”—Suzanne from IA

This week’s question

What is the most niche theme for a party you’ve been to or thrown?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I host an annual chili cook-off, and one year, the theme was ‘sleep shirts.’ Everyone who attended had to bring an old shirt they’ve slept in, and the winner of the cook-off was awarded a garbage bag full of those sleep shirts.”

ECONOMY

Labor market just won’t turn the heat down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Er?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Paris Hilton <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Er?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Simple Life/Disney-ABC Domestic Television via Giphy
The US keeps adding jobs like it’s its job, based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that dropped yesterday.

The economy gained <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/1S-?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f51415d065f9> 339,000 payrolled employees in May, more than in each of the preceding three months and way more than the 190,000 Dow Jones predicted (to be fair, expert estimates lowballed 13 of the latest 16 job reports, according to CNBC).

All that growth happened in spite of climbing interest rates, inflation, recent bank failures, and a nerve-racking debt ceiling standoff that threatened to destroy the economy.

Wall Street evidently interpreted the news as a big green “buy” sign. But not all indications pointed to the hot streak continuing forever.

Signs a cooldown might be coming

The unemployment rate inched up last month, wage growth slowed, and workers appear less self-assured that the labor market is their oyster.

The self-employed crowd lost 369,000 people from its ranks in May (a possible culprit in the unemployment increase), a possible sign that folks might be ditching the flexibility of selling [insert homemade artisanal product here] for the security of a traditional employer.

And they’ve become less inclined to tell their boss “See you never!”: Recent data shows quit rates have declined from an all-time high in late 2021, in a wind down of the pandemic job-hopping trend dubbed the Great Resignation.

Someone at the Federal Reserve better have a PhD in Mixed Signals Processing

Powell and friends will have to use the conflicting economic indicators to decide whether to further crank up interest rates at their next meeting this month.

Reversing a two-year-old policy, YouTube said yesterday that it would no longer take down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ew?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=9458c072d47c> content containing false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 US presidential election or other past presidential contests. The company explained that  leaving the policy in place could curtail political speech “without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.” However, it hasn’t given the final word on how it plans to treat the 2024 election, saying it would provide more information on that in the future.

Don’t use Venmo to park your cash, regulator warns. Venmo may be the best way to remind your friend that she still hasn’t settled up for her share of last month’s group dinner, but it’s not much better than stuffing bills under your mattress when it comes to keeping your money somewhere, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau cautioned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ex?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=145e2a4319b6>. The app and others, like CashApp, Apple Pay, and PayPal, aren’t banks, so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation doesn’t provide insurance for funds stored there, the CFPB pointed out. The agency said there are billions of dollars at risk if these apps were to suffer their own SVB-like failure.

Companies are paying up over forever chemicals. Chemical makers Chemours, DuPont de Nemours, and Corteva said yesterday that they agreed to pay <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ey?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4e1c3df8f031> $1.19 billion to resolve claims that they were responsible for contaminating US water systems with PFAS. But that settlement is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to litigation against a slew of companies over these chemicals in the water supply. Thousands of cases over the issue have been consolidated in federal court in South Carolina, and the first major trial against 3M is scheduled to start Monday. But Bloomberg reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7Ez?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f8d927af8f25> 3M is nearing a deal to resolve claims for at least $10 billion instead.

There might be a new player in the telecom field, and it’s not a startup trying to make 30-second, garbled Owl City ringtones a thing again. Amazon is potentially negotiating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EB?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=855f56d68db0> with the major wireless carriers about offering cheap (anywhere from $10 to free) wireless plans for Prime members, Bloomberg reports.

Amazon denied that such a plan was in the works, and T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon said they were not in talks with the company. But the market reacted anyway.

For the big mobile carriers, the news sent their stocks down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EC?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=8d870b34fa44> as Wall Street feared a new low-cost mobile offering could undercut the vice grip they have on the market. Verizon and AT&T both dropped more than 3% yesterday and T-Mobile fell over 7%.

But the smallest player of the group, Dish Network, which declined to comment, saw its shares surge 16%. The provider is currently trying to revamp its image from the people who sold your parents an expensive satellite dish to a big-name wireless competitor. And a deal with Amazon could be the key to making that happen.

Looking ahead…any potential deal is still months away from an official announcement and there's a chance the whole thing will fall through, insiders say. But there’s also a chance that Amazon is gearing up to take over a whole new market.—MM

Tell your neighbor they can come out of their doomsday shelter—that viral story about a drone going Skynet mode on its human operator isn’t true.

The story: On Thursday, based on an aerospace association’s blog <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EH?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=df4928298914>, news sites reported that a US Air Force colonel recently said an AI drone killed its supervisor in a mission simulation. To make matters worse, Twitter did its everybody-panic-right-now thing, and some posts amplifying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EI?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ea704692c8e1> the story left out the word “simulation.”

But…the Air Force clarified that the simulated mission never happened, and news sites quickly updated articles circulating online to say the colonel was speaking hypothetically about a thought experiment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EJ?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=1b52f3556fd7>.

Still, it’s understandable that people were quick to believe the story given recent statements made about AI:

On the same day the false story broke, President Joe Biden said some AI scientists he’s met with “are very worried that AI can actually overtake human thinking and planning” in an address to…the Air Force Academy’s graduating class.

Earlier in the week, Yoshua Bengio, one of AI’s “godfathers,” told the BBC that the military is “one of the worst places where we could put a super-intelligent AI.”

Of course, if the spread of misinformation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7EK?mbcid=31680313.2848494&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c4f6afee4ae1> online is a concern, it looks like AI’s not the only culprit.—ML

El Niño is so back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zQ?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustrated thermal map of the globe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zQ?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas
In terms of historic, Earth-changing potential, there is only one thing arriving this summer that could one-up the Barbie movie: El Niño.

If you don’t remember everything from your eighth-grade environmental science class, El Niño is the climate pattern that warms up water in the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years.

It can simultaneously lead to excessive rainfall and severe drought in different regions, particularly the tropics.

Climate change exacerbates its effects, so experts warn that this year’s El Niño <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zR?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=32c233dcccd9> could cause extreme heat with “far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management, and the environment,” according to the World Meteorological Organization.

It could also lead to trillions in economic losses

New research published in Science estimates that the next El Niño, which has a 90% chance of beginning this year, will cost the global economy $3 trillion through 2029. That astounding economic damage can come from immediate losses and longer-term knock-on effects.

Consider some of the ways El Niño has wreaked havoc in the past:

A Nature study demonstrated a link between El Niño years and civil war in 93 tropical countries. It also found that since 1950, one out of five civil conflicts has been influenced by El Niño. Why? One hypothesis relates violent conflict to declining crop yields. Another is that people are more likely to engage in conflict when they’re hot—a theory you can directly confirm by going to Carowinds in July.

A NASA study found that the 2015–2016 El Niño triggered disease outbreaks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7zS?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=b293e32dd86a> worldwide. Cholera spread in Tanzania due to contaminated water due to flooding, while dengue fever rates spiked in Brazil and Southeast Asia as warm, wet conditions amplified the presence of mosquitoes.

Looking ahead…your summer tan might be more St. Tropez than Saint-Tropez. As El Niño comes on the scene, it “could push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” the World Meteorological Organization said.—CC

The agreement is the latest curveball in an often contentious relationship between Musk and the US military over Starlink—the terminals have been crucial for preserving Ukraine’s communications infrastructure during the war, but Musk tweeted several months ago that he doesn’t want them used to escalate a “conflict that may lead to WW3.”

But Apple looms

Meta’s hardware drop came just days before Apple is set to reveal its first-ever VR headset on Monday. While we don’t know much about the iPhone manufacturer’s swan dive into headgear—besides its reported $3,000 price tag—we do know it’s going to be Apple’s most consequential product launch since the Apple Watch in 2014.

Bottom line: While the hype over the metaverse has cooled significantly since 2021, Meta’s and Apple’s headsets show that tech companies are still investing major resources into creating virtual worlds.—MM

There’s a fight brewing in the dairy aisle: The viral Aubrey Plaza “Wood Milk” ad stands accused of breaking federal law by unfairly going after plant-based beverages.

The April ad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A7?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7faf162c81d1> drew criticism for promoting cow’s milk by satirizing plant-based alternatives through a product named Wood Milk and calling the fictional, eau-de-wood beverage “a slime that’s legal to sell,” nutritionless, and not “real milk.” The campaign was created by MilkPEP, the same group behind the “Got Milk?” commercials of the ’90s and 2000s.

But now, it’s got legal trouble. A public health nonprofit, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, filed a complaint <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A8?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3fd181e9911c> last week asking the USDA to stop the “Wood Milk” campaign for violating two rules meant to prevent agricultural advertising from playing hardball.

The ad breaks a federal statute prohibiting statements that “may be false or misleading or disparaging to another agricultural commodity,” according to the complaint.

MilkPEP’s CEO said the campaign was created in response to a current FDA proposal to allow plant-based beverages to label themselves as “milk.” But trouble is, it uses USDA funding, which is illegal when the goal is to influence legislation.

Battle of the milks: Dairy milk consumption has fallen by 42% over the past five decades, while sales of plant-based alternatives grew 6% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7A9?mbcid=31666214.2853345&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=26ae75a1ce97> last year, per Euromonitor.

Retailers brace for a not-so-happy Pride <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uV?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Target logo with pride sticker peeling off and the word "pride" with question mark added to the end. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uV?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas
Before most brands could even email their BEYOU23 Pride discount codes, companies have already begun facing backlash from anti-LGBTQ groups. Brands that normally roll out campaigns and merchandise for Pride Month every June are trying to navigate this year’s climate of more vocal critics empowered by right-wing celebrities and politicians.

The brands at the center of the controversies

Target: Last week, the retailer pulled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uW?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f6ba26c3015b> items created for its Pride collection by the trans designer Erik Carnell and moved displays to the back of some stores, citing violent threats to store employees. The uproar focused on one of Carnell’s designs that features the phrase “Satan respects pronouns,” which wasn’t part of Target’s collection, just his website.

The North Face: After the outdoor brand announced its Pride campaign with drag queen Pattie Gonia last Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene encouraged her supporters to boycott the brand. Fox News and some conservative twitter users claimed that the line included kids clothing, but there's no record of it on the brand’s site currently. The North Face’s parent company, VF Corporation, has defended the campaign, saying it is “honored and grateful to support partners like Pattie Gonia.”

Other companies that have recently drawn anti-LGBTQ ire include Bud Light, Kohl’s, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Even famously conservative Chick-fil-A has seen blowback for having a DEI exec.

Corporate Pride isn’t all rainbows this year: Calls to boycott companies usually fade pretty quickly, but Bud Light has seen six straight weeks of declining sales since its controversial partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and brands are nervous.

But the beer’s 26% drop in sales for the week ending May 20 (its worst week ever, according to the NY Post) could be attributed to the brand also angering the LGBTQ community and its allies with how it responded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7uX?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=fc94df1cb9c8> to the pushback—something other brands have also done by opting to abandon or alter Pride campaigns at the first sign of trouble.

Looking ahead…most companies are still planning to move forward with Pride plans. Coors Light is the main sponsor for Denver’s Pride Parade. Levi’s and Adidas will also run ads prominently featuring gay and trans models wearing and talking about their products.—MM

Not all celebrity liquor brands are success stories like Ryan Reynolds’s Aviation Gin, and Sean Diddy Combs claims in a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v1?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=3f0ae1fce3c7> against Diageo that his Ciroc vodka and DeLeon tequila brands were set up to fail. The suit seeks billions, asserting that the alcohol giant treated them as inferior “urban” lines while lavishing resources on other brands, like George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila. Diddy alleges his race was a factor in the company’s behavior, but Diageo claims it’s just a “business dispute” that’s all about the Benjamins.

There are places you can reliably find high-profile CEOs: the Juvet Landscape Hotel, Burning Man, and this week…China.

CEOs have been flooding the country, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Laxman Narasimhan of Starbucks, and Elon Musk of Tesla. And they’re not just there because they found a flight deal on Skiplagged: US executives are trying to strengthen relationships in China, a critical market for many American companies, as tensions rise between the two governments.

These visits are reviving conversations about “decoupling,” questioning what would happen if two economies, which are integral to each other’s growth, tried to stand on their own (something that both Musk and Dimon explicitly came out against).

The US-China relationship isn’t exactly simpatico at the moment…and it hasn’t been for a while because of concerns over human rights, Taiwan, and China’s relationship with Russia. While the CEOs were en route, China refused a meeting between the two countries’ defense chiefs, and the US accused a Chinese jet of approaching a US plane last week in an “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver.”

Zoom out: Whatever is happening on the political front, the presence of these hotshots in China reinforces what experts say—that the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 economies rely on each other too much right now to sever ties.—CC

Chatbot set to replace US eating disorder helpline pulled for pushing diets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v6?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tessa the chatbot told people to count their calories and do weekly weigh-ins. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v6?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cameron Abbas / Morning Brew
In this edition of AI that backfires: Today, a chatbot was supposed to officially replace one of the largest eating disorder helplines until it got taken offline earlier this week for encouraging calorie restriction and other unhealthy behaviors it was designed to advise against.

The National Eating Disorder Association Helpline already fired all its human workers, so they have no live support to offer right now. The nonprofit says it was a planned move to make way for the so-called wellness chatbot <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v7?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ccae2828977d> named Tessa, but former staffers claim it’s a union-busting maneuver. In March, the NEDA told its six helpline employees and 200 volunteers that their roles were being replaced by Tessa just four days after it was notified of its duty to recognize its employees’ newly formed union.

But Tessa lacks the human touch the helpline had provided since 1999: One activist <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7v8?mbcid=31654035.2863686&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=282861566858> trying out Tessa said it told her to try to lose one to two pounds per week by having a calorie deficit, cutting down on processed and high-sugar foods, and doing weekly weigh-ins.

What now? Tessa is only offline “temporarily” until it’s rid of the “bug” that triggered dieting advice for some of the 2,500 people who tried it out, NEDA CEO Liz Thompson told the Daily Dot. Meanwhile, the helpline’s sacked union has filed unfair labor practice charges.—ML

Stat: The Denver Nuggets are favored to win this year’s NBA championship, but no matter what the scoreboard says, the team will have one guaranteed winner on the court: its mascot, Rocky.

Good morning. Big news from our Morning Brew Daily podcast: We’re releasing episodes much earlier.

Since we launched the pod in the winter, the top piece of feedback—overwhelmingly—was that people on the East Coast wanted to listen during their commutes in the morning.

So, starting today, the team is waking up when the bars are closing to record episodes to be released at 7am ET, up from 10am currently. That means this morning’s episode will probably be live by the time you’re reading this.

You can catch Morning Brew Daily on Apple Podcasts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Gn?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=0708b416cdd2>, Spotify <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Go?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=6f0bb316170f>, watch on YouTube <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/2Gp?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a4804a7edf54>, or check us out wherever you get your shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5Px?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5acf07380a05>.

Tell the world AI may cause human civilization to collapse without going over Twitter’s character limit.

That’s what a bunch of celebrity AI experts did when they signed a 22-word statement warning about the existential risks of the technology that was published by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety yesterday.

Those 22 ominous words: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”

Many of the signatories comparing AI to the A-bomb are the same folks who were foundational in creating the tech: Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI (which created ChatGPT), and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, as well as superstar AI researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, were among the big names who endorsed the message.

What should we be worried about?

Though intelligent machines could supercharge progress in virtually all human endeavors from drug discovery to space exploration, some experts worry they might also cause humans to go the way of the Hartford Whalers.

The Stanford Existential Risks Initiative and Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk both monitor the threats AI poses to human civilization alongside other potential species-enders like extreme climate change and nuclear winter.

These researchers are concerned about a future in which an AI that outperforms humans in various domains (but doesn’t share their values) is prone to catastrophic accidents or misuse.

Prominent AI doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky argues it’s likely that “literally everyone on Earth will die” if superhuman AI comes on the scene.

But worrying about hypothetical evil bots with a Labrador’s knack for destruction might be premature in 2023. Many AI researchers believe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pD?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4bd3e522a294> the advent of sophisticated, multi-talented AI is at least a few decades away, and there’s no consensus about how dangerous those systems might be.

Some AI engineers say we should focus less on the future existential risks and more on pressing threats like misinformation, copyright violations, privacy concerns, concentration of corporate power, and shoddy legal advice <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7mo?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=407edcf12ec0>.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> Elizabeth Holmes checking into prison Mark Felix/Getty Images
Elizabeth Holmes checks into prison. The Theranos founder arrived at the federal minimum-security women’s prison camp in Bryan, Texas, yesterday to begin serving <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pH?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=a97bede13548> her 11-year sentence for defrauding investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. While at FPC Bryan, which is located about 95 miles northwest of Holmes’s hometown of Houston, she will spend time with up to 650 incarcerated women—among them Jennifer Shah, the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star who is also imprisoned there for fraud.

The war in Ukraine comes to Moscow. Drones struck apartment buildings <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pI?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4dd4a77328d6> in Moscow yesterday in the first attack on residential neighborhoods in Russia’s capital since the war began. Russia claimed the drones were sent by Ukraine, and President Vladimir Putin threatened to retaliate with “tit-for-tat measures.” The bold attack on Moscow, which came after days of Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, shows how Putin may have underestimated Newton’s third law of motion when he invaded Ukraine.

A freeze on repayments has been in place since March 2020 due to Covid, and it’s been extended several times as the pandemic dragged on. This deadline for the resumption of payments is similar to the timeline previously laid out by Biden, but it prevents him from issuing another pause.

The latter two have been thrown out of the club since (as has Nvidia, which closed the day just below the $1t mark).

By elevating Nvidia to such hallowed corporate ground, investors are sending a clear message: AI will generate untold riches, and Nvidia, which produces computer chips that power most cutting-edge AI programs, will capture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7i7?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4052d510fc36> much of the value created.

Started from a Denny’s, now we’re here

Thirty years ago over a Grand Slamwich, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang started a conversation that would lead him to create a computer processing powerhouse that has seemingly rode every tech industry wave over the past few decades.

Huang does things his own way, including his fashion choices. From a formal dinner to the cover of Time magazine, Huang is almost always photographed wearing the antithesis of the tech CEO Patagonia pullover: a leather jacket, which will probably have its own Twitter account soon.

Some think Nvidia’s rise is too fast, too furious. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest argued that Nvidia’s stock is “priced ahead of the curve” in a tweet on Monday. Then again, Wood’s flagship ETF dumped all of its Nvidia shares in January, right before the stock rallied $560 billion.—CC

Now that we've all finished our $12 bottle of Dark Kiss body spray from 2013, expensive perfume is having its moment. The US pricey fragrance category has seen a 60% jump <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7pT?mbcid=31642653.3261071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=459ff69344ea> this year compared to pre-pandemic levels, Sue Nabi, CEO of multinational beauty conglomerate Coty, told Yahoo.

Coty, which owns fragrance brands like Marc Jacobs and Gucci, beat its quarterly estimates earlier this month and reported 9% net revenue growth from a year earlier. The company credited a blooming fragrance market to “Gen Zs, men, [and the] Hispanic community in the US,” Nabi said.

No shocker here, but Gen Z’s interest in finding their signature scent is driven by TikTok, which is allowing them to discover indie perfume brands.

Indie fragrance brand Juliette Has a Gun just closed a new funding round after posting sales of $129 million last year.

Is the boom because we all smell bad? Not necessarily—people just need little treats, even during times of economic uncertainty. In a phenomenon dubbed the “lipstick effect,” beauty brands have historically seen an uptick in sales of small luxuries when shoppers are tightening their belts elsewhere. So, instead of buying a big-ticket item like a car, shoppers are splurging on a $100 bottle of perfume.—MM

Irving beat out the other women daredevils in scrambling down the menacingly steep, 200-yard hill to capture a seven-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese, but not before being knocked unconscious first. The winner of the first men’s race of the day, Matt Crolla, told the AP how he prepares: “I don’t think you can train for it, can you? It’s just being an idiot.”

Racecar drivers have a blinking schedule. Formula One racers can have their eyes shut for 20 meters of driving when they blink, which is probably why they do it so selectively when behind the wheel. Unlike non-racecar driving humans who blink randomly, competitive speed demons use their eyelids <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lv?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=631236f1c841> during the same parts of each lap, researchers have discovered. Data from eye trackers attached to helmets showed that racers tend to avoid blinking while changing speed or rounding corners—they save the moistening of their corneas for straight parts of the track.

Train a dog, save a bear. As humans and bears cross paths more often, a Finnish breed of fluffy puppy is increasingly being used to save grizzlies’ lives from lethal methods of protecting people. The Karelian bear dog is made for this: They’re known for facing large mammals fearlessly and historically had been used as hunting dogs. Now, park managers and others in charge of keeping humans and wildlife safe train the canines to chase bears <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lw?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=82e4afb098f2> off of inhabited land, where they’d probably be killed if they got too close to people. Studies suggest this scare tactic is more effective than using rubber bullets or loud noises. Black bears in Lake Tahoe, California, became more nocturnal and visited urban areas less after getting scared off by a Karelian bear dog.

  TRAVEL

As lounge access has become a common credit card perk, economy travelers are gleefully repping their plastic to revel in the standard spoils of the lounge life: free buffet, open bar, strong wi-fi, and copious outlets. As a result, lounges are becoming common scenes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lA?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=4ed33d470852> of mayhem reminiscent of Black Friday at Walmart, especially during peak travel times.

If you flew anywhere this weekend, you might’ve noticed overcrowding in those fancy waiting rooms or even a line to get into one. It’s possible you also spotted a legacy patron (likely a businessperson with a briefcase and a cigar) wistfully looking into the distance and remembering the times when the lounges were bastions of premium travel exclusivity.

How lounges became for the people

Back in the day, airline lounges resembled snooty gentlemen’s clubs reserved for VIP business travelers and folks willing to pay top dollar to fly first class.

Things began to change in 1985 when American Express introduced the first credit card that came with access to private clubs around the world as a way to lure traveling customers. This paved the way for the democratization of airport lounges a couple decades later as travel cards began to adopt complimentary access as a perk.

The advent of networks like Priority Pass, which began in the 1990s, and Centurion Lounges launched by American Express in 2013 allowed people to access lounges without having to commit to flying with a specific airline. These networks offer subscription plans, and some lounges allow people to enter on a pay-per-visit basis.

Many savvy travelers find a $99 annual charge and a $35 entry fee for Priority Pass to be financially prudent given how eye-poppingly high airport food prices tend to be. And options for getting in abound: Today, Nerdwallet lists 19 different cards available in the US that open lounge doors, one even coming with a no annual fee intro offer.

Meanwhile, the number of lounges has swelled to 3,000 around the globe, many of them operated not by airlines but by the credit card companies themselves. Demand for the pleasant preboarding hangout spots has far outstripped supply. And the flight delays and cancellations that have been plaguing aviation for the past couple years mean many folks are spending longer waiting around…and taking up lounge space.

But there’s a counterrevolution happening

Airlines still rely on first-class passengers for much of their revenue. As travel continues to recover from the Covid slump, these businesses need to make sure that prized customers have a superb experience not just on the plane but when they’re waiting to board—and trying to sip a preflight martini while being swarmed by sweaty plebes isn’t going to cut it.

So, companies are taking pains to make lounge air rarefied again:

* Delta announced last fall that only frequent fliers would be able to purchase Sky Club lounge privileges.

* Lounge operators are also limiting the number of hours passengers can spend in them, and beginning to charge for any guests who want to tag along.

For now…though lounges are becoming more exclusive again, travel execs are saying that this summer might be the busiest air travel season on record, so don’t expect the lounges at your local airport to stop resembling sardine cans any time soon.—SK

Robot revolution? Not quite. You can breathe a sign of relief—AI isn’t replacing your job just yet. Instead, MIT researchers are hopeful we can work collaboratively with ChatGPT, DALL-E, and more.

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Monaco and Indianapolis <#> Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc drives during the warm-up lap prior to the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Monaco street circuit in Monaco, on May 23, 2021 For the record this is in Monaco, not Indianapolis. Valery Hache/AFP via Getty Images On the surface, Monaco and Indianapolis do not have a lot in common. But when you dig deeper…okay, they still don’t have a lot in common.

So, what links this Midwestern capital with a tiny country on the French Riviera? And why are we discussing both in the same section?

Open-wheel racing is the answer

Today, Indianapolis and Monaco will host two of the most famous auto races on the calendar: The Indy 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix. Let’s “pit” the two races against each other across several categories.

Party scene: While the Indy 500 is known to have epic tailgates, Monaco has the edge because it’s synonymous with high society. A-list celebs and DJs throw exclusive parties on yachts docked at the marina, plus expensive Champagne > warm light beer.

Size: Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the largest sports facility <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lM?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2983a525c846> on the planet, with a capacity of nearly 400,000 people across the property. Meanwhile, Monaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world. No contest.

Layout: The two track layouts could not be more different. At the Indy 500, cars will zoom around a sprawling 2.5-mile oval for 200 laps. In Monaco, they’ll snake through the winding, historic streets of Monte Carlo. Although the twisty Monaco track leads to notoriously boring races, it wins for the scenic backdrop along the Mediterranean.

Speed: Both IndyCars and Formula One cars can hit ludicrous speeds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7lN?mbcid=31609759.3255170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=d4c100b12d1d>. The top recorded speed for an IndyCar is 236 mph, while the fastest recorded speed for an F1 car is 231.4 mph. However, F1 cars have better acceleration. This one’s a tie.—NF

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week we asked: What is the best day of a three-day weekend: Saturday, Sunday, or Monday? Here are our favorite responses.

* “Monday, for sure. There’s nothing like setting your alarms like usual, just for the joy of waking up, smiling impishly to yourself, turning it off, and rolling over until who knows when!”—Alex from Minnesota

* “How does Friday not get any love? It’s got tThe anticipation of the long weekend ahead mixed with the excitement of the half-empty office because colleagues are either taking the day off or just leaving early anyway.”—Anonymous

* “As a full-time retail worker, very rarely do I get three days in a row off (unless I request it). So, I would say Monday, because getting regular pay on top of holiday pay makes for a happy paycheck!”—Anna from Raleigh, NC

* “Sunday. Summer = BBQ (over indirect heat, not a gas grill!), which takes hours (all day for a brisket). Start the pit, trim the brisket, drink a bloody mary (with Tito’s vodka, of course). Put the meat on the smoker, wife gets up, mimosas. Spritz the brisket and add ribs to the smoker, pop a beer. Spritz the brisket and ribs, have a beer. Wrap the ribs, have a beer. Wrap the brisket, have a beer. BBQ for dinner on Sunday, leftover BBQ on Monday...and all day Monday to relax and enjoy a cold beverage or 2.”—Mark from Missouri City, TX

This week’s question

With a busy summer travel season expected ahead of us, we want to know: What is the best car game to play during a long road trip?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “My friends play this game where someone comes up with a music category, such as ‘If your life was a movie, this song would play at the final credits,’ or ‘First dance at your wedding.’ Everyone in the car queues up a song that fits the category and we listen to all of them, all the way through.

Markets: While we’ve turned our attention to weddings, the best parties you can attend alongside your college roommate’s grandma, investors have remained focused on the negotiations for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a June 1 default.

TRENDS

More barns, less merch: How weddings are changing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jI?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Barn wedding setup <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jI?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Getty Images
Weddings reflect society. From the first sip of wine at cocktail hour to the final chorus of “Country Roads,” weddings are a showcase of our values, fashion sensibilities, food tastes, interest in religion, economic climate, and much more.

As American culture shifts, so do weddings. To understand how weddings have evolved in recent years, we turned to The Knot, a wedding site that conducted a large-scale survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jJ?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=236fe7a90c29> of couples who planned weddings in 2022.

Here’s a look at what’s trending up and trending down at weddings (promise it’s not as dramatic as this introduction).

Trending up

1. Beyond Diamonds: Lab-grown meat may be slow to take off, but lab-grown diamonds are now firmly in the mainstream. The Knot found that 36% of center stones for wedding rings were grown in a lab, double the share in 2020.

What’s behind the trend? Without complex viewing equipment, lab-grown diamonds look identical to mined diamonds, plus they don’t carry any of the ethical baggage of diamonds mined from the earth. They’re much cheaper <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jK?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7f4317e34a41>, too: A 1 carat lab-grown diamond went for $1,430 earlier this year, while a similarly sized mined diamond retailed for $5,635, the WSJ reported.

2. A venue that’s a nearby barn: Almost 60% of couples chose a wedding site that was within 30 miles of where they live, while only about 20% of couples chose a destination wedding, The Knot said. Meanwhile, for the first time, barns/farms tied with banquet halls as the most popular wedding venues.

3. Signature cocktails: Forty percent of couples had a “signature cocktail” at their wedding, no doubt with names like Mai Gai or Bloody Marry Me that will make your face pucker as much as the liquor does. The share of weddings with signature cocktails has increased 17 percentage points over the last five years, The Knot said.

1. Custom merch: Couples are beginning to realize that no one wants a koozie with their wedding date on it. With custom merch headed straight to the trash can after guests return home, the ritual of handing out wedding favors has fallen by 21 percentage points in five years.

2. Wedding hashtags: #ThankGod. Born out of the need to organize wedding photos on Instagram in the early 2010s, the cringey wedding hashtag is dying a slow, punny death. Only 32% of couples created a wedding hashtag last year, down from 55% in  2017.

3. Affordability: While 38% of couples said their wedding budget/planning was impacted by the economy in 2021, that share jumped to 54% in Q4 last year as inflation spiked and made an already expensive event even more pricey. The couples surveyed by The Knot spent an average of $30,000 on their weddings last year, up $2,000 over 2021.

Other fun facts:

Ed Sheeran’s song “Perfect” was the most popular song for first dances for the sixth year in a row in 2022.

The average guest count for a wedding last year was 117.

Location matters: The average cost of a wedding in the NYC metro area was $60,000, but the average cost of a wedding in Cleveland was less than half that, at $27,000.—NF

Here in the states: Same-sex couples, married or not, now represent nearly 1% of the US’ 127 million households, according to the 2020 census. Five years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, census takers found that wedded same-sex couples accounted for 0.5% of households and unmarried same-sex partners for 0.4%.

It costs to be friends with someone in love: People are spending more money on bachelor and bachelorette parties than ever before.

In 2023, the average cost of a party was $10,800, according to the party-planning app Bach <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jR?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2b9d9bb1c557>, up from $7,700 in 2021. That puts the cost per person at ~$1,200 for a typical nine-person party.

Why? It’s a combination of longer-lasting parties and jam-packed itineraries on top of higher prices. According to Bach:

More people are opting to start their party on Thursdays instead of Fridays, adding an extra day of costs for accommodation and activities.

Boat parties and party bus tours are being booked 5x more than last year.

In a blow to the patriarchy...a 2022 survey by Savings.com <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7jS?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=84b11995496b> found that bachelor party attendees shelled out more on average for every spending category, including travel, lodging, and activities, than people on a bachelorette trip. The discrepancy is likely due to bachelor parties being smaller (with fewer people to split costs) and typically featuring activities with a higher price tag, like golf and sports events.

In the same survey, 52% of people said they took on credit card debt to attend a bach party. Between drinks (~$100), hotels (~$200), and flights (~$500), it really adds up. Then again, watching your soon-to-married-friend get drunk on a Pontoon Saloon? Priceless.—CC

If you’re dying to watch someone’s drunk inlaws do the Cupid Shuffle this year, listen up: Instead of taking a platonic bestie, a mutual, or even just someone they meet at a bar, people are increasingly turning to TikTok to find a date for their friend or family member’s special day.

How it works: “In need of a +1” posts typically fall somewhere between a Survivor audition tape and a supercut of someone’s chillest moments (e.g., driving a boat, dancing at a formal function, having a dog.) Viewers whose interest is piqued by the post compete for the role of hot stranger’s date via DM or a link-in-bio survey form. The poster then sifts through a college admissions committee’s worth of applications.

Tens of thousands of people (mostly 18- to 34-year-olds) watch videos tagged with #plusone or #weddingdateapplication each day, on average, according to TikTok data.

The hashtags have garnered about 5 million views since February and 35 million since the summer of 2020.

Vegas weddings are still king…for now <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kb?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Little Vegas Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kb?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Barry Lewis/Getty Images
In September, hundreds of couples will participate in a production that’s so incredibly Vegas: The fake-tanned Dennis Bono will host <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kc?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=2c66c68cb822> a mass vow renewal event at Caesars Palace to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the London Daily Herald calling the city the “Wedding Capital of the World.”

Las Vegas, which boasts over 50 wedding chapels, has been known for its campy, quick ceremonies since the city loosened marriage restrictions in the early 20th century.

In 2021, Nevada (powered by Las Vegas) had the highest rate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7kd?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=7651e3b6ff97> of matrimony with 26.2 new marriages per 1,000 people.

About 4% of US weddings happened in Vegas in 2021, according to Axios’s analysis of CDC data.

A Vegas wedding timeline for the rich and famous

Celebs have always supplied a steady stream of marriages for Sin City. Celebrities made Vegas weddings a thing in the ’60s, when the likes of Judy Garland, Betty White, and Frank Sinatra chose it for their second, third, or whatever number marriage they were on. But Las Vegas’s matrimonial reputation was sealed once Elvis and Priscilla Presley wed at the Aladdin Hotel in 1967.

In the mid-2000s, Vegas weddings became more associated with short-lived partnerships, micro-marriages if you will. Think Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon or Britney Spears’s infamous 55-hour marriage to Jason Alexander. Still, couples like JLo and Ben Affleck, Kourney Kardashian and Travis Barker, and Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner all opted for the “traditional” Vegas wedding within the last few years.

But it’s not all roses and fake Elvises. Despite bouncing back from pandemic lows, Vegas weddings aren’t occurring at the volume they used to. In 2004, Clark County issued some 128,000 marriage licenses, but last year it handed out just 80,000.—MM

And they lived happily ever after…but not without the help of spreadsheets, productivity tools, and G-Cal invites. For an increasing number of couples, software designed to be used at work is key to a successful marriage at home.

Many spouses are using workplace productivity tools <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k3?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=c469d3c23523> to organize their relationship in what Bustle calls the “HR-ification Of Marriage,” reflecting the fact that making a marriage work can be a full-time job. In one recent popular video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k4?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=816d9137178b> on TikTok, a wife shares how she and her husband schedule a weekly admin meeting.

So, if you’re attending a wedding this summer, here’s a gift idea: a Google Docs relationship management template.

For the entrepreneurial couple selling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k5?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=217258d7be71> these templates (at a fraction of the hourly rate of even a subpar divorce lawyer), the tools are a way to feel like they’re on the same page. The anonymous duo behind the MD Meets Techie <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k6?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5a1b8d0ef20a> brand describes how productivity software Notion helps them stay on top of plans, discuss relationship values, and keep each other accountable in working toward personal goals. On a less administratively minded note, they find their shared relationship management work to be “a reminder of what we’ve experienced together as a couple.”

But many spouses are opting for spreadsheets. Whether it’s planning a cross-country move <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k7?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=e481dc121f06> with the database tool Airtable or using Google Sheets to track <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7k3?mbcid=31612469.3256210&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=f990c95c87a9> household chores, sometimes marital bliss is about adequate accounting.

For others, it’s all about proper scheduling. “If a social commitment for us or any kind event for our son doesn't make it onto G-Cal, it doesn’t happen,” says our editor Abigail Rubenstein of her nine-years-strong marriage.—SK

Good morning. If you thought you were getting ahead of the Memorial Day travel rush by flying out today…we regret to inform you that everyone else had the same idea. Today is expected to be the busiest day for air travel across the holiday weekend, with 51,194 expected flights, per the FAA.

That means opportunities to power up at the airport will be scarce, so remember to juice your laptop beforehand and maybe throw some extra cash in your carry-on to bribe the Keeper of the Outlet Hole (kid with a Nintendo Switch).

Stock spotlight: Nvidia shot up in after-hours trading after revealing that it had surpassed revenue expectations thanks to soaring demand for its chips, which are notably needed for AI. The company has added more than $220 billion to its market cap this year—that’s the value of more than one whole McDonald’s Corp.

The bird is no Fox, DeSantis disaster shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dG?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> DeSantis officially announced his 2024 bid in a Twitter Space conversation with Elon Musk. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dG?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
It was supposed to be a triumphant moment for both Ron DeSantis and Twitter CEO Elon Musk when the Florida governor officially kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign last night—not with a televised appearance, but with a Twitter Spaces event featuring the entrepreneur. Instead, it called to mind that time Musk shattered a Tesla Cybertruck’s windows onstage during a demonstration meant to show their strength.

The audio-only event was marred by repeated technical glitches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dH?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e226b41efbf> because Twitter’s servers couldn’t handle the more than 500,000 attendees listening in. At one point, the original webcast was ended and a new one was started (with fewer listeners making it in), but tech issues persisted even after that, making the world’s second- richest person look about as competent as Roman Roy.

And while half-a-million listeners sounds like a lot, it’s pretty paltry compared to the millions of viewers Fox News averages daily—plus, Fox has video!—though given how the event turned out, it may be better for DeSantis that only 250,000 people ultimately tuned in to the restarted event.

Not ready for prime time

Before the debacle, some were ready to proclaim Musk the heir <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7d3?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=5e518846164a> to Rupert Murdoch’s conservative media throne. It made sense: While right-wingers have recently slammed Fox for becoming too liberal for their liking, Twitter has been beefing up its conservative media bona fides:

The Daily Wire, home to polarizing figures like Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh, says it will bring its podcast videos to Twitter beginning next week.

After being dumped by Fox, Tucker Carlson announced he’ll be taking his show to Twitter.

Musk also reinstated the accounts of Fox News fan favorites Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

But the server meltdown that caused the glitches proved that Twitter’s not ready to take on Fox and friends just yet.

Bottom line: Musk is working to Make Twitter Profitable Again, but the DeSantis fiasco highlighted the site’s weaknesses.—ML, AR

The star, who began her singing career in the 1950s and remained hugely popular even as music transitioned into its MTV era in the ’80s and beyond, overcame a difficult past, including an abusive marriage to guitarist Ike Turner with whom she performed before leaving him and becoming a major solo artist.

US credit rating called into question.

It said it had put the nation’s triple-A credit rating on “rating watch negative,” meaning it’s poised for a downgrade if lawmakers can’t work things out. Even negotiations that drag on too long before a deal is reached could trigger a downgrade: That’s what happened in 2011, when S&P dinged the US’ credit over default fears. S&P still hasn’t returned the nation’s score to its highest rating.

A criminal investigation into the botched law enforcement response to the mass shooting remains ongoing, according to the Associated Press.

No one has mastered the art of the comeback quite like Abercrombie & Fitch.

The clothing retailer reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7da?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=15b5f29ac93a> impressive first quarter earnings yesterday, posting a surprise profit of $16.6 million (compared to a $16.5 million loss for the same time last year) and seeing same-store sales grow by 3%. In response, its stock jumped 31% yesterday.

The brand has come a long way: By the time former CEO Mike Jeffries was ousted from the company in 2014, Abercrombie had settled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7db?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=ef895e553dec> a $50 million discrimination lawsuit, fielded sexual misconduct allegations against one of its go-to campaign photographers, and made a whole bunch of racist T-shirts. But the retail villain of the 2000s has spent almost a decade rehabbing its image.

Whatever they put in that Fierce cologne is working. The new Abercrombie, led by Fran Horowitz since 2017, is absolutely crushing it with its larger size selection and casual logo-free tops. Even as other retailers whiffed on earnings reports amid grim economic outlook, the company now expects its full-year net sales to grow 2–4% instead of its previously forecast 1–3%.

Looking ahead in fashion…watch the cargo pants space. Horowitz said the “non-denim bottom trend” is blowing up.—MM

Whatever old sunblock you have buried in the bottom of your beach bag, it may be time for an upgrade. A new report by consumer advocacy group EWG found that 75% of sunscreens <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dg?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=eb761ed235a8>on the shelf contain harmful ingredients.

Despite the FDA warning about 12 potentially unsafe ingredients in sunscreen back in 2019, not much has changed on the legal side since the agency says it still needs more data before it makes any decisions. The most concerning chemical, oxybenzone, is known for hormone disruption and a host of other issues, but remains legal for manufacturers to use.

Due to consumer pressure, only 6% of sunscreens contain oxybenzone today, compared to 60% in 2019, per the EWG study. Still, many of the other ingredients the FDA flagged are still widely used, including octocrylene, which becomes a carcinogen when it breaks down.

Get used to looking like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Mineral sunscreens (think zinc) are widely recommended as the safest option to avoid toxic chemicals, or check out EWG’s list of recommended safe sunscreens <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dh?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=095e9042eb10>.—CC

Stat: Asian Americans make up just 7% of the US population, but luckily for your taste buds, their cuisines are overrepresented in the restaurant business <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/7dl?cid=31588413.97850&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f&mblid=93bad598c4d4>—12% of the nation’s restaurants serve Asian food of some kind and 73% of all US counties have at least one, per Pew Research. Of those, 39% feature Chinese food, with the next most popular options being Japanese food (28%) and Thai food (11%). Thailand’s presence in the top three, despite the relatively small size of the Thai American population, is partly thanks to the Thai government supporting restaurants abroad as a form of diplomacy. Your move, India. (Please! We need more dosa joints.)
