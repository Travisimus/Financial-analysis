WeWork’s bankruptcy means many more open floor plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZH?mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> WeWork office in San Francisco <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZH?mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images
Not since Alexander Payne’s 2017 movie have we seen downsizing upset so many people. Yesterday in bankruptcy court, WeWork asked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZI?mblid=7cfee2b6f65c&mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> landlords representing nearly $3 billion of the failed company to please, please, pleeease be open to renegotiating and canceling its leases.

The SoftBank-backed, short-term office space rental company that heavily overused the word “community” and plunged from a $47 billion valuation in 2019 to ~$44.5 million now filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday evening. The company hopes to restructure its balance sheet and get out of numerous, expensive commercial leases while some locations stay open and operational.

WeWork’s shrinking floor plan is everyone’s problem

A few years ago, landlords were scrambling to get the hot company to move its cool coworking tables and nitro coffee taps into their buildings. But many who succeeded will now be lucky if they only lose a couple million bucks. The building at 149 Madison Avenue sold in February at a $10.7 million loss after WeWork, its main tenant, left in 2020.

WeWork plans to break at least 69 leases out of its 600+ locations nationwide as part of its restructuring plan.

Forty-one of those are in New York City—at its height, WeWork was the city’s biggest office tenant. WeWork’s planned closures would push 1.57 million square feet of office space back into the city’s already bloated commercial real estate market.

The Big Apple, Boston, and San Francisco are all expected to be hit hard as roughly 42% of WeWorks properties are in those cities.

It couldn’t come at a worse time: Finding office tenants is about as difficult as finding a friend to give you a Friday afternoon ride to the airport. More than 20% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZJ?mblid=caaccc53a7cb&mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of office space in the US is vacant right now, according to real estate services company JLL.—MM

The actors strike is over.

Hollywood has been at a standstill since writers walked off the job in May (they made their own tentative deal in September), and actors joined them on the picket line in July. More details on how the actors’ union resolved thorny questions such as the use of AI likenesses are expected to emerge Friday after the union’s national board meets to discuss the agreement, which will have to be approved by the union’s members.

It’ll be a competitor to Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster Wegovy in the growing weight loss drug market, which analysts predict will be worth $100 billion by 2030.

A decade after gamers first galavanted through the high-resolution streets of Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V, we’re finally about to get a peek at the powerhouse franchise’s next installment.

What’s the big deal? GTA V is the second best-selling videogame ever (Minecraft reigns supreme). Analysts predict similar success for GTA VI and a higher price ($70), which could spell a heist-level payday for investors and retailers:

Back in May, Take-Two said they project “groundbreaking titles” to boost sales by $8 billion next year, hinting at a 2024 release for GTA VI. The company’s stock is up almost 31% this year, driven partly by GTA VI buzz <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZT?mblid=c6006326d515&mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, Reuters reported.

As the sun rose in California yesterday morning, so, too, did a new airship backed by Google co-founder and dirigible fanatic, Sergey Brin.

Pathfinder 1 flew its first test flight <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dZ-?mblid=bccc0f179463&mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Wednesday after 10 years spent manufacturing the next-gen airship characterized by “blood, sweat, and tears,” according to LTA Research CEO Alan Weston. With funding from the billionaire Brin, LTA (“Lighter Than Air”) has made huge breakthroughs in modernizing the old-fashioned technology.

Longer than three Boeing 737s, the electric aircraft could usher in a new, greener era in flight:

LTA’s airships could eventually carry 200 tons of cargo each—roughly 10 times as much as a Boeing 737, according to Weston, making them a viable alternative to freight planes, ships, and trains.

Weston and Brin want to use the airships for humanitarian relief missions since the aircraft doesn’t require much infrastructure to take off or land.

Looking ahead…Pathfinder 1 has a long journey of tests before it can fly irl. The plan is to move the operation from Cali to Akron, Ohio, where LTA is already planning to make a larger version of the craft.

Quote: “We knew that this day would come. It’ll take us a while, but life will go on here at the zoo.”

Zookeepers expressed their sadness yesterday as they helped load the National Zoo’s three giant pandas <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d-3?mblid=a29f5e7b8114&mbcid=33306165.2709113&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> onto a plane bound for China, which recalled the animals as the loan agreement for them expired, leaving Washington, DC, panda-less for the first time in 23 years. For the 19-hour journey, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and Xiao Qi Ji rode on a FedEx cargo jet dubbed the Panda Express, which was decorated with a giant panda decal and filled with bamboo as an in-flight snack. It’s unclear whether China will offer the zoo new pandas in a continuation of a diplomatic tradition that goes back to the Nixon administration.

Last month, a Morning Consult poll found that 48% of people in China considered the US an enemy or unfriendly, compared to more than 80% responding to the same question in April 2022. More than 75% also said they were concerned about US–China tensions, an issue that President Biden and China’s President Xi Jinping will likely address when they meet this weekend in San Francisco during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Xi also plans to dine with US business leaders.

Trump testifies in fraud case <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dT-?mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo of Donald Trump <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dT-?mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images
Donald Trump took the stand yesterday in New York State Attorney General Letitia James’s civil fraud case alleging he inflated his assets to appear wealthier and take advantage of lower interest rates and insurance costs. Things got testy during the ex-president’s testimony.

The stakes are high: New York City Judge Arthur Engoron already ruled that Trump, his adult sons, and their company are liable for fraud (Trump is appealing). Unlike the criminal cases pending against Trump, this lawsuit has no chance of resulting in jail time, but the trial will determine whether the judge grants James’s request for a $250 million fine and a ban on Trump doing business <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dT_?mblid=1a2dd952daef&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the state of New York.

There was plenty of snark and frustration to go around…

Judge Engoron asked Trump’s lawyer to “control your client,” and later threatened to remove Trump from the stand for refusing to answer questions directly, insulting the judge, and calling the trial “unfair.”

Trump said he had no involvement in preparing a 2021 financial statement because he was busy at the White House “keeping our country safe,” causing prosecutors to clarify that Trump was not president in 2021.

One point of contention: what Trump’s properties are really worth, including Mar-a-Lago.

So, how do you appraise Mar-a-Lago?

During his testimony, Trump claimed it was actually undervalued in the financial documents and worth as much $1.5 billion.

But the Palm Beach County Property Assessor had valued it between $18 million and $37 million, leading the judge to say in his ruling that Trump inflated the price by 2,300%. Meanwhile, real estate agents have told news outlets they’d put it between $300 million and $600 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dU0?mblid=632080104993&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Why so many choices? Tax assessors historically value properties much lower than a real estate agent would. Also, because Mar-a-Lago operates as a private club, the assessor appraised it based on its annual net operating income but not on potential resale or development value.

Looking ahead…Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is set to testify on Wednesday.—CC

WeWork is officially bankrupt. WeWork, the coworking space where your friend with a startup job bragged about getting beer on tap, filed for <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUC?mblid=14a3ebe2e233&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey after years of struggles that began with a failed IPO in 2019. Since it nixed the IPO after investors got a look at its books and just how much power WeWork’s eccentric founder Adam Neumann had, WeWork (which eventually went public via SPAC) has suffered from having signed on to very expensive leases in its pre-IPO rush to grow. In 2019, the company was valued at $47 billion, but it has since fallen steadily, and this year its stock has plunged 98% giving it a ~45 million value as of last week.

Think of it as AI apps (with their own app store) for specific tasks. “Eventually, you’ll just ask the computer for what you need, and it’ll do all of these tasks for you,” CEO Sam Altman said in his keynote speech. The company revealed that ChatGPT has 100 million weekly users. OpenAI also previewed an even more powerful update to ChatGPT known as GPT 4-Turbo and cut prices for its software.

Epic wants to sell in-game items (like skins) on Android devices without needing to pay fees by going through the Google Play Store. The lawsuit claims that Google…

Hinders competitors to its Play Store, which charges developers (including Epic) 15%–30% on in-app purchases.

Bumble CEO steps down amid tough times for dating apps <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUg?mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Bumble CEO <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUg?mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jerod Harris/Getty Images
Bumble and its CEO are unmatching each other: It announced yesterday that, as of January, Whitney Wolfe Herd will no longer run <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUh?mblid=3b873f3c135b&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the female-forward dating platform she founded in 2014.

Wolfe Herd devised Bumble’s flagship ladies-DM-first concept to give women control of their romantic lives sans unsolicited messages from weirdos and grew it from a scrappy startup that relied on guerrilla marketing in sororities to a conglomerate with several subsidiaries that help millions of people connect. They’re not breaking up completely: She’s still the company’s largest individual shareholder and will transition to executive chair.

But it’s rough out there

Wolfe Herd’s departure comes as dating apps struggle to get singles to pay for algorithmic introductions, and as college students snub them <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUi?mblid=8b4a9c2b4e03&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Tinder and Hinge owner (and Bumble competitor) Match Group saw its stock tumble earlier this month after it reported that Tinder lost paying subscribers last quarter and its Q4 revenue predictions were lower than analysts expected.

Meanwhile, Bumble has faced rising marketing costs as it tries to compete, with the company’s stock price falling almost 83% since its blockbuster IPO in early 2021.

Looking ahead…Slack CEO Lidiane Jones will be Bumble’s new chief executive as of Jan. 2.—SK

Stat: Here’s another reason to stay in school: It may shorten your commute. The average commute <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dUm?mblid=6552e80102c4&mbcid=33277944.2727702&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the US is ~27 minutes, but people with college degrees now spend less time getting to work weekly than people whose schooling stopped after high school—though the opposite was true pre-pandemic, according to a New York Times analysis of government data. This reflects the fact that transit schedules remain altered due to the dip in ridership caused by the pandemic, and people without advanced degrees are more likely to rely on public transit to get to their jobs.

As the legendary singer tells it, Cook was “lovely” and took care of the problem for her. “I guess that’s one perk of fame!” Streisand told the BBC in an interview yesterday while promoting her new memoir, which will undoubtedly contain many inspiring tales of personal struggles like this one.

Good morning and Happy Halloween. Today used to be the day Spotify would cut off your listening data for inclusion in its end-of-year Wrapped list; however, this year the company will keep collecting your info for at least a few more days.

That means you could theoretically game the system by binging songs that would make your musical taste appear more sophisticated than it is. But, let’s be honest: No one actually cares about what music you’ve listened to this year. So we say let Creed rip.

President Biden issued an executive order on AI yesterday that is as comprehensive as a typical dad steakhouse order. The first-of-its-kind federal action aims to regulate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dCX?mblid=238d7fd6225b&mbcid=33197356.2719964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an industry that has so far been mostly left to its own devices.

The biggest consequence? The developers of future advanced AI models will have to submit safety test results to Uncle Sam to prove they are not a public threat.

It’ll be a group effort

Different parts of the government will have a role in ensuring the tech doesn’t cause too much of a ruckus:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology will set benchmarks for safety testing, which the the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy will use to evaluate risks to national security and infrastructure.

The Department of Commerce will issue directions for watermarking AI-made content, so you can know if that Harry and Meghan divorce announcement is a deepfake.

The Department of Labor and the National Economic Council will study ways to mitigate the effects of AI on jobs.

The Department of Justice will get extra training and tech assistance to investigate cases of AI algorithmic bias while landlords, federal benefits programs, and government contractors will receive guidance to ensure that they’re using AI equitably.

What else? The White House will develop guidelines for federal agencies to strengthen AI privacy protection practices, but Biden said it’s up to Congress to pass consumer privacy rules for the industry. The order also aims to standardize the government’s use of AI by streamlining the process for federal agencies to buy AI tools and hire experts. It also provides resources for small developers and researchers in an attempt to prevent a handful of corporate behemoths from dominating the industry.

But…the order is only a starting point that establishes important norms. It consists mostly of recommendations and contains some guidance that isn’t enforceable by the executive branch, making it unclear how effective it’ll be in practice. And of course, it has little power over international AI developers.—SK

Meanwhile, people making less than $45,000 pulled back on Big Macs in Q3, but the foot traffic dip was offset by the higher menu prices.

McDonald’s also attributed its above-expectation earnings to recent marketing campaigns <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8ih?mblid=03799fa153ba&mbcid=33197356.2719964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and to its app, delivery, and in-store kiosks, which together made up 40% of Q3 sales.

Big picture: The market for men’s underwear has long been dominated by Hanes and Fruit of the Loom, but Skims CEO Jens Grede thinks the company can disrupt the industry with its functional fabrics in chic neutral shades—and it’s already brought in male athletes with plenty of panache to help.

Brazilian soccer star Neymar, Oklahoma City Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa were all tapped for the first ad campaign.

Skims said that men accounted for 20% of website traffic prior to the release of the men’s line. Within the first five minutes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dDf?mblid=4353acd557cd&mbcid=33197356.2719964&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of launch, the website had 25,000 orders.

But only $40 million comes from his time on the basketball court.

Why? EVs are piling up at dealerships because many people aren’t willing to pay the higher average sticker price, especially now that interest rates <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsM?mblid=547b33d9bd25&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> have made car loans more expensive.

GM has also postponed the opening of its second electric truck plant and mutually canceled a joint venture with Honda that aimed to get millions of under-$30,000 EVs on the global market.

Elon Musk is considering delaying the construction of a Tesla “Gigafactory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsO?mblid=9eaf0d7cb135&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” in Mexico.

Electric vehicles have also become, as Ford CEO Jim Farley recently put it, a “political football <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsP?mblid=aff38ce0494a&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.”

Among Americans, only two Republicans own EVs for every five EV-owning Dems, according to research company Strategic Vision. And President Biden’s support for EVs has made them a target for his 2024 presidential opponents. Vivek Ramaswamy said EV buyers have “a psychological insecurity,” while Donald Trump and Mike Pence have both amplified fears that a transition to electric would destroy jobs.

Tour de headlines <#> Civil defense teams and civilians conduct search and rescue operations after Israeli attacks on Gaza City. Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images
Israel–Hamas war update: Israel’s military said yesterday that its ground operations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzk?mblid=af3812e45fb6&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> were “expanding” in Gaza, and it also intensified airstrikes on the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Internet and phone services were cut off in the territory amid the escalation, which reportedly came after talks aimed at getting Hamas to release more of the over 200 hostages it captured during its deadly Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel failed to produce a deal. Israel has been amassing troops ahead of an anticipated ground war in Gaza, which is expected to be long and difficult not only because of the complexities of urban warfare but also because Hamas maintains a network of underground tunnels.

The jury heard from SBF. Yesterday, Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzl?mblid=10fc78728549&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for a second day in the criminal fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, and, unlike the day before, the jury was allowed to listen—but only after the judge ruled in the morning that SBF couldn’t say most of what he wanted to about relying on lawyers’ advice as the crypto exchange’s CEO. But he did manage to say he did not defraud anyone, while acknowledging that he made “a number of small mistakes and a number of big mistakes” and “a lot of people got hurt.” He also noted that he bought the naming rights to the Miami Heat’s stadium for FTX because “I didn’t want to be known as the Kansas City Royals of crypto exchanges.”

UAW gets closer to deals with GM, Stellantis. The two automakers have reportedly offered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzm?mblid=f8296a2072c4&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> 25% wage hikes over four years to match the tentative deal the union struck with Ford earlier in the week. Though the two sides continued meeting to hash out details, a deal to end the six-week strike is said to be close between the union and GM. For now, ~28,000 workers from GM and Stellantis are still on strike, and any tentative agreements reached must be approved first by the union’s leaders and then by a majority of its members.

Maine mass shooting puts spotlight on red flag laws <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzn?mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Crime scene <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzn?mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Angela Weiss/Getty Images
The mass shooter who killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston, Maine, this week is still on the loose. As authorities hunt for the suspect, Robert Card, a local firearms instructor with a history of severe mental illness, some are wondering whether stricter gun laws could have prevented <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzo?mblid=18fc3d61e002&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the carnage.

Maine allows citizens to carry concealed weapons in public without a permit, and almost half of its adult residents live in a gun-owning household, according to the Rand Corporation, but…

Per the so-called “yellow flag” law Maine in 2019, a judge can temporarily take someone’s guns away if police deem that person a threat, though only after they are taken into protective custody by police and evaluated by a medical professional.

The majority of Maine’s lawmakers in 2019 opposed a stricter “red flag” law, like the ones enacted in 21 states and Washington, DC, which don’t require a medical evaluation before firearms can be seized.

Critics argue the Lewiston tragedy shows that the yellow flag law isn’t enough, since a forced detention requirement makes it difficult to enact. They also cite the efficacy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzp?mblid=6501b1a029e2&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of red flag measures in other states. Others question why Card didn’t lose his weapons under existing rules, given that the Army reservist recently spent two weeks in a psychiatric facility after threatening colleagues.

Meanwhile…Congressional Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat from Maine, apologized to his constituents in Lewiston for previously opposing a nationwide ban on assault weapons like the one used by Card.—SK

There are few times in this life you’ll hear someone earnestly complain about hearing Céline Dion. But some residents in one New Zealand town are desperate for their local government to do something about the “siren battles <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzu?mblid=06933af9a08a&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” that have blared her music through the streets of Porirua for the last year.

Siren battles are part of an emerging subculture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzv?mblid=8998eb8f652c&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in New Zealand where people wire sirens and loudspeakers onto their cars or bikes and then compete to blast the clearest music. Dion’s songs, which have high treble and little to no bass are popular choices because they can be blared without getting garbled. (Reggae is also a fave.)

But residents say the battles, which used to end by 10pm, have started lasting through the night. Porirua’s city council received 106 complaints related to siren battles from October 2022 to March 2023.

Tonight might be louder: Some credit the start of nightly stentorian car concerts to fans who blared jams during last year’s Rugby League World Cup. And today, New Zealand plays <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzw?mblid=de4e7d37d09a&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> South Africa in this year’s World Cup final to determine the first ever four-time Rugby World Cup winner.

Stat: The old Taylor may not be able to come to the phone right now ’cause she’s dead, but revisiting her past eras has officially made Taylor Swift a billionaire <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzA?mblid=4ae4ced5dd5f&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. According to Bloomberg, the success of the Eras Tour (estimated to have added $4.3 billion to the US GDP) helped propel Swift into the rare group of musicians to achieve a net worth above $1 billion almost exclusively from their music. As Bloomberg tells it, Swift has raked in $400 million from music released since 2019, $370 million from concerts and events, $120 million from song streams on Spotify and YouTube, $80 million form royalties—plus $110 million from property ownership. Yesterday’s release of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) probably won’t hurt either.

We do not give financial advice, but the folks at Bank of America do…and they say to snap up stocks that cater to boomers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzB?mblid=f1ee27eb76dd&mbcid=33173512.3088093&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> while avoiding ones aimed at millennials. The bank’s number crunchers believe that because high interest rates have enlarged the older set’s savings accounts while squeezing millennials, it makes sense to focus on the likes of cruise lines and American Express, while avoiding clothing companies (especially e-commerce ones like Revolve). But, because the younger generations stand to inherit, the head of one financial advisory firm told Bloomberg this strategy was like “skating to where the puck is and not where it’s going.”

Several other tech stocks fell with it, but not Microsoft, which rose because its cloud numbers looked good.

The United Auto Workers union said it reached a tentative labor contract with Ford that, if ratified, would mark the biggest gains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dtc?mblid=7ceacc3a5033&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for unionized auto workers in decades. The deal includes a 25% pay bump over the four years of the contract, cost-of-living adjustments that had been previously suspended, and a quicker timeline for new workers to reach the highest wage ($40 an hour for assembly workers by the end of the contract).

How we got here: The UAW, led by fiery president Shawn Fain, began picketing against the Big Three Detroit automakers—Ford, GM, and Stellantis—in September. Fain channeled Joker with his unconventional “targeted strike” approach: The walkouts started small, but over time expanded to other auto plants in unpredictable fashion with the goal of sparking maximum chaos for carmakers.

Over nearly six weeks, the strike got nasty between Fain and carmaker CEOs, who he compared to a billionaire class detached from the real lives of working-class people. Automakers shot back that the UAW’s demands were unreasonable and surging labor costs would hinder the competitiveness of the US auto industry on the global stage.

But it seems like the UAW’s strategy worked. Fain boasted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dtd?mblid=df1f0b3a82c4&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the union “won things nobody thought was possible” in the new contract.

What happens next: Fain will have to convince local UAW leaders that the deal is indeed as generous he describes, and then it’ll have to win a simple majority vote by Ford’s union-represented workers to be ratified.

The fight now heads to GM and Stellantis

With the Ford contract sewn up, the UAW will now intensify negotiations with GM and Stellantis in the hopes they’ll agree to similar terms.

The union ramped up the pressure on the two automakers this week when it called for strikes at Stellantis’s most profitable US factory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlM?mblid=384dd06de523&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>—a Ram plant in Michigan—and at a GM plant in Texas that makes large SUVs including the Cadillac Escalade.

Zoom out: While its strikes are ongoing, the UAW’s record deal with Ford continues the momentum of organized labor—whether it’s UPS workers or Hollywood writers—posting huge Ws this year.—NF

Mike Johnson as speaker of the House. After 22 speaker-less days when nothing could get done, the House has its work cut out for it: Johnson will have to lead the body through negotiations to pass a budget that keeps the government from shutting down on November 17. The Trump-aligned Louisiana lawmaker, who has opposed funding for Ukraine, will also have to navigate President Biden’s request for a $106 billion funding package that includes money for Ukraine and Israel, and another one for $56 billion to cover domestic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsF?mblid=e2b227ee8b10&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> priorities.

Biden calls for an end to attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. As Israel continues to prepare for a ground war in Gaza, President Biden yesterday spoke out publicly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsG?mblid=6e2855d2e2f9&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against attacks by “extremist settlers” in the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory, which is not governed by Hamas, saying the violence is merely “pouring gasoline on the fire.” Meanwhile, at the UN, a US-backed resolution condemning Hamas and calling for the group to release Israeli hostages, while also asking for “humanitarian pauses” to allow more aid to reach Gaza, failed. Separately, Israel demanded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsH?mblid=4a28dfa040ad&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the UN secretary general resign over his remarks that Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel “did not happen in a vacuum,” prompting him to say his statements were being mischaracterized.

Zuck’s “year of efficiency” is working.

That’s thanks in part to cutting costs and expenses by 7%, and achieving an operating margin that’s double what it was a year ago.

Boeing’s defense unit is struggling so bad it’s making even the Denver Broncos blush.

The aviation manufacturer reported a $924 million loss for the unit in Q3, $482 million of which was lost entirely on the two 747 jets that will make up the next Air Force One fleet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsY?mblid=95f4aed8de9e&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. That brought the total loss on the presidential planes to an estimated $2.4 billion in the last five years. Boeing blamed higher manufacturing expenses caused by engineering changes, labor shortages, and supplier negotiations.

The jets are becoming a financial sinkhole. Boeing signed a $3.9 billion fixed contract with the US government in 2018 to assuage then-President Trump after he criticized the company and threatened to cancel the order. CEO David Calhoun later admitted that agreeing to produce the new Air Force One planes was a “very unique negotiation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsZ?mblid=c697b43d864c&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” that the company “probably shouldn’t have taken.”

Plus…making a plane fit for a president isn’t easy. Both jets need missile-defense systems, nuclear-protected communications, and (presumably) custom bald eagle wallpaper. Boeing’s task is further complicated because in order to meet Trump’s desire to cut costs, the company had to use two planes that were originally made for a Russian airline.—CC

Microsoft is finally tweaking an Excel feature that has caused nearly two decades of grief for scientists. The feature, known as Automatic Data Conversion, which in the past constantly converted certain human gene names into dates and created massive errors in scientific research, can now be disabled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsq?mblid=9018058dc9ea&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

If your science background is more Intro to Geology…every one of the nearly 44,000 human genes has a shortened version of its name and a symbol. So when a scientist typed SEPT1 to represent the Septin-1 gene in an Excel sheet, the program would assume they meant September 1 and change it. And if you’ve ever been the dogsbody who has to comb through an Excel file, you know it’s easy to miss a tiny error like this.

But those tiny errors amounted to big problems: A study of 10,000 scientific papers on genes published from 2014–2020 found that more than 30% contained a gene name error that was Excel's fault. It got so bad that by 2020 the governing body behind gene naming had updated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dsr?mblid=e78ff3ad783b&mbcid=33146421.3099137&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> 27 gene names so they couldn’t be mistaken in the Microsoft program (i.e. SEPT1 became SEPTIN1).

Meanwhile, 39% said they’d like to see more asexual or aromantic characters represented. They may be over romance in real life too: In a separate survey from January, 44% of Gen Z agreed “I would rather clean the toilet than go on another online date.”

Off-the-charts bond yields are making your life more expensive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlG?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Government bonds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlG?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jitalia17/Getty Images
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond shot above 5% in early trading on Monday—the highest it’s been since 2007—before retreating a bit.

While a high return <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlH?mblid=ea2328f5e70f&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on long-term government debt sounds like something only a Wall Street wonk would fret about, it can raise borrowing costs for everyone from homebuyers to small businesses.

Yields have been rising steadily for almost two years as investors watched the Fed repeatedly raise interest rates to cool inflation, making the current lower-interest bonds less valuable, just like your current iPhone when a new one comes out.

Bond yields are used as the measure against which lots of other interest rates are set, so recent sky-high yields are behind the current eye-popping mortgage rates, which have made homeownership 52% more expensive than renting, and they’re part of the reason why the number of Americans struggling to make car payments is at its highest since at least 1994.

Yields crossed the symbolically significant 5% mark yesterday because investors rushed to sell off 10-year bonds, making them cheaper, per the Econ 101 law of supply and demand—that in turn boosted the bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of their price.

So, why has Wall Street pressed “sell” on Treasurys?

Some analysts say investors are shedding government debt because the US is being a spendthrift. The government’s budget deficit rose 23% compared with last fiscal year and it plans to spend big on wartime support for Ukraine and Israel.

Budget holes have forced the Treasury to sell off more government debt, pushing down the price of bonds already on the market.

The influential billionaire investor Bill Ackman is believed to have single-handedly lowered Treasury yields to 4.85% yesterday afternoon by saying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlI?mblid=4902c01b6335&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> he’d ended his bet on bond prices falling because he thinks the economy isn’t as strong as it seems. 

But everyone’s still watching JPow: Signs of a resilient economy have investors worried about the Fed’s next move. Though, ironically, through-the-roof bond yields could keep the Fed from needing to hike rates since they could slow the economy and temper inflation.—SK

The auto strike hits Stellantis in its “moneymaker” <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlM?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A two-faced blue pickup truck <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlM?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Image: Insider
Detroit’s Big Three automakers might as well be performing a ballet recital with the way the United Auto Workers union is keeping them on their toes.

In a surprise walkout yesterday, the UAW directed 6,800 workers at Stellantis’s largest Ram 1500 assembly plant to join the picket line <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlN?mblid=70cb2ffeaa1a&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, which now includes more than 40,000 of the ~145,000 UAW members at the three companies. The Ram pickup trucks are Stellantis’s bestsellers in the US.

This tracks with UAW President Shawn Fain’s promise <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZN?mblid=0762dadc003e&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to increasingly squeeze Stellantis, Ford, and GM until they agree to the union’s demands. “It’s time to amp up the pressure,” Fain said yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlO?mblid=d0a6ffe8c7ae&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, calling the Ram plant Stellantis’s “moneymaker.”

Since the strike began on Sept. 15…the Big Three have lost $4.2 million and their suppliers have lost $2.8 billion, according to the Anderson Economic Group. Stellantis, Ford, and GM have conceded record improvements to wages and working conditions, but Fain believes they can offer more. Stellantis argued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlP?mblid=22e164ffcf02&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the UAW’s strategy “sacrifices domestic market share to non-union competition <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-i?mblid=3df1c286fb99&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.”

Marvel to join Magic: The Gathering in major crossover <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlT?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> ‘Magic: The Gathering’ card <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlT?mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Marvel/Wizards of the Coast
A behemoth collectible card game is joining forces with some heroic IP. Yesterday, Hasbro announced a collaboration <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlU?mblid=48810044c471&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with Marvel that will bring its superheroes to its billion-dollar collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.

The first cards in the multiyear, multi-set collection will drop in 2025. Hasbro hasn’t revealed what the cards will look like, although the dramatic announcement video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlV?mblid=e061832ab95e&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> hints that Thor, the Scarlet Witch, and Captain America will be included.

Why it matters: Magic has collaborated with other media franchises on one-time special editions before—including Dr. Who and The Lord of the Rings—but this partnership is the most ambitious yet. Partnering with some of the biggest IP in the world is a strategic move by Hasbro as it looks to expand the collectible card game, something we may hear more about when the company reports its earnings on Thursday. Hasbro relies on Magic like the Kardashians rely on Kim—it’s the company’s most popular and profitable brand, outpacing the likes of G.I. Joe and the Transformers.

But…some players (and analysts) worry that the brand’s rapid release of new cards could flood the market and devalue the franchise, threatening the devotion of collectors, some of whom spend tens of thousands of dollars <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlW?mblid=cfa8f79c72ca&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on rare cards <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dlX?mblid=83828074e278&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.—CC

Key performance indicators <#> Bobi, the world's oldest dog PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP via Getty Images
Stat: Bobi, a Portuguese pup certified by Guinness as the oldest dog ever, died <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dl_?mblid=0672b62ed74e&mbcid=33120277.2720076&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this weekend at age 31 years and 165 days. And while his owner, who was just 8 years old when Bobi was born in 1992, will undoubtedly miss his loyal companion, there are no bones about the fact that Bobi—a dog that lived on a farm, was never put on a leash, and got to eat the same food as his humans—had a long, full life. He made it to ~217 years old in dog years, far eclipsing the expected 10- to 14- (human) year lifespan for his breed, the Rafeiro do Alentejo.

NBA trivia (you don’t need to know basketball)

The NBA regular season starts tonight, and have you noticed some of the team names seem a little…off? It’s not like Utah is known for its jazz.

That’s because teams moved cities but did not change their names. In today’s quiz, we’ll give you an NBA team whose mascot doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, and you have to name the city that the team moved from.

1. Might as well start with the Utah Jazz

2. Memphis Grizzlies

3. Los Angeles Lakers

4. Sacramento Kings

ANSWER

1. New Orleans

2. Vancouver

3. Minneapolis. Get it? Cuz there are so many lakes in Minnesota.

4. Kansas City. This team was called the Royals but when they moved to Kansas City (from Cincinnati) they changed the name to Kings to avoid confusion with the city’s Royals baseball team.

5. San Diego. The San Diego Clippers is a reference to the sailing ships in San Diego Bay.

Good morning. Wet weather is forecast for New York City today, the seventh consecutive weekend it’s rained here.

Seriously—what is going on? Meteorologists say that a persistent weather pattern in the upper atmosphere has created ripe conditions for storms in the Northeast. But we’re convinced it’s a curse…the Curse of Dave Lozo. Not coincidentally, Dave started writing at the Brew around the same time the weekend washouts began.

Hamas allowed two Americans who were among the 203 hostages held by the group to leave Gaza yesterday. The deal to free the mother and daughter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/di7?mblid=e414589dd703&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> captured during Hamas’s violent Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel was brokered by Qatar.

The tiny but oil-rich country is uniquely positioned to liaise between Israel’s allies and the Gaza strip’s Hamas-run government. (The US and the EU have labeled Hamas a terrorist group.)

Why? Qatar hosts a strategic American air base on its territory, earning it the Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) designation the US typically reserves for friendly countries like Australia and Japan. At the same time, the country that hosted last year’s World Cup has been hosting (and bankrolling) Hamas…

Qatar’s capital, Doha, is the location of Hamas’s international headquarters and is the longtime home of the org’s top brass, including its de facto leader, Ismail Haniyeh.

The Qatari government doles out $30 million monthly to needy Gaza residents and for Hamas-run civil services (though the notorious shadiness of Hamas’s finances makes it impossible to know where all the suitcase cash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/di8?mblid=ad5c09d9b0d0&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> really goes).

When incredibly valuable assets come up for sale, it’s typically the wealthiest people who end up taking home an amazing investment. But not always…

One platform is taking on the billionaires at their own game, buying up some of history’s most prized blue-chip artworks. Its investors have already realized annualized net returns of 17.8%, 21.5%, 35% and more <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dhT?lp=text1&mbadid=1d3a0a9e6b5d29be8cbb101362c1c4e7&mbadv=a&mblid=f027a32b5eac&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

It’s called Masterworks. Their nearly $1 billion collection includes artists like Banksy, Picasso, and Basquiat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dhT?lp=text2&mbadid=1d3a0a9e6b5d29be8cbb101362c1c4e7&mbadv=a&mblid=4c7871e06e62&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Tour de headlines <#>
Jim Jordan is no longer the House speaker nominee. After losing a third vote on the House floor and another one behind closed doors, the Ohio rep became the second lawmaker nominated by his party (after Steve Scalise) to give up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/diI?mblid=5794ebfd3034&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> trying to become the replacement for Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted by a hard-right group of colleagues. Where does this leave the leaderless House, which can’t conduct any business? Still stuck. Republicans say they’ll start fresh on Monday to try to find someone they can get behind. It’s not clear who that could be, but any potential speaker needs broad GOP support because Democrats will continue to unite behind their own party leader.

Biden asked Congress for $106 billion in foreign aid. Whoever ends up with the speaker gavel is going to have their work cut out for them, especially since the president just asked for a massive aid package <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/diJ?mblid=8d1a2b1cf001&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, in part to avoid future fights over new funds for Ukraine and Israel (both of which have their critics in Congress). The package includes $61 billion to carry Ukraine through a full year, $14 billion for Israel as it fights Hamas, $10 billion for humanitarian aid, plus cash to counter China in Asia. Whether it can get through Congress or not, you’ll probably hear more about this as the election heats up.

SCOTUS to weigh White House communications with social media companies. The Supreme Court has agreed to review <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/diK?mblid=e84bf879b233&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an appeals court’s ruling that the White House coerced social media companies to take down controversial content. While it does, it’s putting on hold the an order barring some members of the Biden administration from further communications with the companies. It adds to a high court term already packed with social media cases, including one over when government officials can block social media followers and another over state governments’ efforts to regulate content moderation.

What do the IRS and the person who Venmo charges their ex-boyfriend for his birthday gift have in common? They’re both getting what they’re owed. Yesterday, the agency reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dih?mblid=585e5974a1df&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that it has recovered a total of $160 million from more than 175 high net worth individuals.

The crackdown is part of a larger effort by the IRS, bolstered by $60 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, to close the estimated $688 billion gap between taxes owed and what the agency collected in tax year 2021.

Some of the money collected so far came as restitution in criminal cases, including from miscreants like…

One person who paid back $15 million to the IRS after being caught deducting personal expenses—including a 51,000 square-foot mansion with tennis, basketball, and bocce ball courts—as business expenses.

Another person who pleaded guilty to falsifying tax returns and stealing $670,000 from their business, $502,000 of which went to gambling.

No struck Halloween costumes this year, actors union says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dim?mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Halloween costume bag with a picture of a wizard on it and the bag reads “Wizard: General”.

Actors are going to have to get creative or fight over the giant banana costume at Spirit Halloween. SAG-AFTRA urged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/din?mblid=48a9dd998be2&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its members not to dress up as characters from works by studios they’re striking against this Halloween as the actors union continues its longest walkout in history.

Sorry to celebs who were going to dress as M3GAN or rollerblading Ken and Barbie, but if they want to post their costumes on social media, they’ll have to find a more general costume like a wizard or ghost to avoid giving studios free publicity. Union members can also dress up as characters from reality TV, music videos, commercials, or independent productions—so the slate of A24 horror films are fair game.

Today marks 100 days on strike for SAG-AFTRA. And a note about costumes probably wasn’t the message workers in the entertainment industry were hoping to get from the union, but negotiations abruptly stalled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dio?mblid=b1ffaae24ca2&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last week.

There was a brief moment of hope when a group of Hollywood A-listers led by George Clooney pitched the actors union a plan that would involve highly paid actors chipping in more to cover what the studios wouldn’t pay. But the union rejected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dip?mblid=a66b412d8d8b&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the idea.—MM

Key performance indicators <#> A weight-loss drug NurPhoto/Getty Images
Stat: The already booming market for weight loss treatments like Ozempic might get even bigger as drug companies seek to make them available for small fries. The CDC estimates that ~20% of kids 6+ in the US have obesity, and manufacturers are working to make their weight loss drugs available for that age group. According to Bloomberg, Novo Nordisk is testing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/diu?mblid=6e76fc5333ed&mbcid=33098884.2704498&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its Saxenda in kids as young as six, and Eli Lilly is getting ready for similar trials of Mounjaro. That could give the companies lifelong customers since the drugs only keep weight off as long as people take them—and Goldman Sachs’s recent estimate that the drug category would make $100 billion by 2030 didn’t even take sales to kids into account.

Good morning. We never thought we’d see the day, but Skechers might get worn on an NBA basketball court—by an MVP, no less. According to The Athletic, the often-mocked sneaker brand is in talks with Philly’s Joel Embiid to become its star endorser. He would wear them in games if a deal is completed. Odds of repeating as MVP = down 95%. Odds of looking the most fly on the court = up 200%.

Don’t sleep on Skechers (or in them). It signed a lifetime deal with Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane and is potentially pushing into basketball with Embiid and Julius Randle of the Knicks.

Still no House speaker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbA?mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A general view shows House of Representatives vote on a new Speaker of the House at the US Capitol on October 18, 2023 in Washington, DC. US lawmakers rejected hard-line conservative Jim Jordan’s bid for speaker of the House of Representatives in the first round of voting October 17, 2023, entrenching a stalemate that has paralyzed Washington for two weeks. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbA?mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mandel Ngan/Getty Images
The House of Representatives, like your cheap friend who swears by the iPhone-in-a-bowl method for parties, is still speakerless. After Ohio Republican Jim Jordan failed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbB?mblid=12885d1111fa&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to get enough votes in a second round of voting to secure the top job in the House yesterday, the GOP remains divided on what steps to take next and the body remains frozen without a leader.

Jordan was 18 votes shy of replacing ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the vote yesterday—and he received two fewer votes than he got in the first floor vote on Tuesday, a sign that support for Jordan’s nomination might be waning. Since every House Democrat (212) voted for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, there’s very little margin for disagreement among the 221 Republicans.

What’s next?

Vote again…and again. In January, it took five days and 15 rounds of voting for McCarthy to finally win his brief speakership. Jordan expects a third floor vote today at noon ET.

Some GOP members are urging Jordan to take negotiations off the floor and come back when he knows he has the votes.

But California Republican Mike Garcia said that’s not working either, and that House Republicans need a little off-site at somewhere like Gettysburg to “remember why we do what we do.”

The temp may get more power. One quick fix that’s gaining steam is allowing Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, to have more latitude than just overseeing the voting for a new speaker. Republican Rep. Mike Kelly introduced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbC?mblid=11ae9eb60353&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a resolution that would temporarily give McHenry some of the speaker’s powers, like moving important bills through the House.

What’s the rush? Aid packages for Ukraine and Israel are currently in limbo. And remember that shutdown we narrowly avoided because Kevin McCarthy mustered support for moving the deadline to November 17? Now, without a speaker, the House is losing time to pass a budget for real. We’re feeling mad deja vu saying this, but a shutdown would have serious implications outside of Washington: It could stall IPOs and prevent the release of data the Fed needs for making rate decisions.—MM

Biden vows support for Israel during visit. After Israel's prime minister met with President Biden, Israel agreed to allow humanitarian aid <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbG?mblid=01eb4f619470&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to enter Gaza via Egypt, and Biden later said Egypt was prepared to let in up to 20 trucks carrying supplies cross the border. Biden said the US would send $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Gaza and the West Bank, as well as an “unprecedented” package for Israel’s defense. The president also said US intelligence supported Israel’s position that the bombing of a Gaza hospital that has spurred anti-Israel protests across the region was caused by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. But, he also offered words of caution, saying the US had “made mistakes” after 9/11 and, “while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it.”

But it’s not because the streamer is suffering: Netflix reported yesterday that its password-sharing crackdown is bearing fruit and the company added 8.8 million subscribers in the third quarter compared to just 2.4 million in the same period last year. Although Netflix gained customers in every region, average revenue per member decreased year over year because many subscribers were on lower-priced plans. For the higher price, there’ll be less new content because of the Hollywood strikes.

The company said its operating margin was at 7.6% for the quarter, similar to a traditional car company’s and down from the 17.2% margin it enjoyed the year before. But Tesla said it still plans to deliver more cars this year than last and that its Cybertruck will finally start delivering by the end of November.

HEALTH INSURANCE

The jump—the highest since 2011 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbL?mblid=498cf110da29&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>—was driven by inflation, higher wages for healthcare workers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEd?mblid=323458149074&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and hospital system mergers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbM?mblid=2dbe98736bfe&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, health policy experts say. Here’s what it means for employers and the ~150+ million Americans who get insurance through work:

The increase amounted to ~$500 more out of pocket for family plan-holders, and $75 more for solo riders—further squeezing consumer spending power, which is already constrained by lagging wage growth that hasn’t caught up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbN?mblid=3096b764dc3d&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to high inflation.

Employers often bear the brunt of increased health spending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbO?mblid=2aa9141d93c9&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> because, in order to stay competitive, they’re wary of offloading too much of the rising costs onto their workers. That’s likely why deductibles haven’t grown much in the past five years.

But things might get worse: 1 in 4 companies surveyed by KFF said they plan to increase employees’ premium contributions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbP?mblid=ab4d59395421&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the next two years.—ML

United tries to fix airplane boarding <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbT?mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> An illustration of an airline ticket <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbT?mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
United will give its window-seat passengers more time to gaze into the vast expanse, put on “Ribs” by Lorde, and pretend they’re in a movie.

Starting on Oct. 26, the airline will board window-seaters in economy class before middle- and aisle-seat travelers to speed up the boarding process <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dbU?mblid=80063208c71f&mbcid=33072009.3091323&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to an internal memo.

They won’t be able to completely cut the line: Groups such as active duty military and people with disabilities will board the plane first, followed by first class and business class.

But, when it comes time for the hoi polloi to get on the plane, United is hoping that by getting the window seats filled first, the total boarding time per flight could be cut by up to two minutes.

Two whole minutes? It doesn’t sound like much, but an aircraft at the gate is an aircraft not making money, so putting the boarding process on 1.1x speed, spread across thousands of flights per day, can add up to a lot of time saved—and make happier passengers more likely to fly with United again.

Zoom out: Plane boarding experts (they exist) say that window-seats-first is a step in the right direction, but it’s not nearly the most efficient way to fill a plane.

Despite facing numerous controversies since he became commissioner in 2006, Goodell has grown the league into a dominant cultural force and a money-making machine: Revenue has tripled over his tenure, to $20 billion per year.

Stock spotlight: Pfizer rose yesterday even though the pharma giant cut its expected revenue by $9 billion on Friday in the face of declining sales of Covid treatment and vaccines. The move reassured investors that stability was coming to Pfizer, but it made them question other Covid vaccine makers like Moderna and Novavax, which fell.

 

HEALTHCARE

SBF is among Americans not getting their ADHD meds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5J?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Sam Bankman-Fried leaves court <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5J?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Pacific Press/Getty Images
FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers made an unusual request as his fraud trial was about to enter its third week: More Adderall for their client.

In a weekend letter to the judge, the defense team asked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5K?mblid=ed286c61dd97&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for SBF, who has ADHD, to get 20mg of long-release Adderall before court sessions to help him maintain focus. They say the stakes are high because…

Access to the ADHD meds would be critical for his decision on whether to testify in the trial in which he’s facing up to 110 years in prison.

SBF’s current dosage is below the amount he’s prescribed, leaving him unable to concentrate and “meaningfully” participate in the trial.

The jailed cryptopreneur is just one of many Americans affected by the ongoing nationwide ADHD medication shortage. The Food and Drug Administration declared a shortage on Oct. 12, 2022, and drugmakers are still struggling to produce enough Adderall over a year later. It caused some providers to prescribe alternatives like Vyvanse and Concerta, some of which are now also in short supply. 

Why isn’t there enough Adderall to go around?

The proliferation of e-health startups has made getting a prescription easier than before, contributing to the uptick in patients. At the same time, the abundance of cheaper generic versions of Adderall leaves manufacturers with less profit motive to stock up in preparation for a potential shortage.

Pharma companies initially blamed the shortage on supply chain snags, but more recently, they have said restrictive regulations are limiting their ADHD drug production.

The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) imposes quotas on how much of the active ingredients in ADHD meds companies can acquire, since most of them are classified as addictive substances.

WORLD

Tour de headlines <#> Palestinians, some with foreign passports, wait for aid and potential crossing into Egypt. Picture Alliance/Getty Images
The Gaza–Egypt border remained closed. Despite optimism from US officials that Gaza’s southern border with Egypt would open to allow foreign nationals out of the bombarded territory and aid in, the Rafah Crossing stayed shut <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5O?mblid=532cdbfdc4ed&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Monday, sowing confusion as the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza worsened. Following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks, Israel launched a series of retaliatory strikes in Gaza and shut off the area’s electricity and water. Talks to open the Rafah Crossing were held up by Egypt’s concerns that Israel would not pause its airstrikes in the area, WSJ reported. Between 500 and 600 Americans are trapped in Gaza, the State Department estimated. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US and Israel have agreed to allow aid to reach Gaza, but believe Hamas could try to disrupt it. President Biden will visit Israel tomorrow in a show of solidarity, after warning the US ally against occupying Gaza.

Big donors pull back from Ivy League over response to Israel–Hamas war. Major donors at UPenn and Harvard have made it clear that they’re displeased <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5P?mblid=0f3447be9694&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> enough to leave their checkbooks closed. Jon Huntsman, whose family name is on Wharton’s main building, joined Wharton advisory board chair and billionaire Apollo CEO Marc Rowan in withholding support from the school over what they view as the university’s failure to condemn antisemitism. Billionaire donors Bill Ackman and Kenneth Griffin are among those who have criticized Harvard for not taking a stronger stance against Hamas after a letter signed by student groups blamed Israel for all violence, and a nonprofit founded by Leslie Wexner, who made billions running Victoria’s Secret, is cutting ties <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5Q?mblid=36e87829cc98&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with the university entirely.

LinkedIn laid off nearly 700 employees. The cuts were centered on the social network’s core engineering team <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5R?mblid=f8576e1ec382&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, CNBC reported, though product, talent, and finance teams were also affected. It’s LinkedIn’s second round of significant layoffs this year after it eliminated a similar number of roles in May to streamline operations and lean into artificial intelligence. The latest cuts, which represent 3% of LinkedIn’s 20,000-member workforce, come as the Microsoft-owned company’s year-over-year revenue growth has slowed for eight straight quarters amid a declining advertising market—even as its user base has ballooned to more than 950 million.

FINANCE

Bottom line: Fewer students want to be accountants <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5S?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Kevin from accounting on The Office <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5S?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Office/NBC via Giphy
College students have crunched the numbers, and a career in accounting is no longer adding up for them.

According to the most recent data from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the number of US students graduating with either a bachelor’s or master’s degree in accounting dropped 7.4% during the 2021–22 academic year from the year before, the largest one-year decline since at least 1994–95.

The biggest reasons for the decline?

Pay has stagnated. According to the WSJ, the average starting salary for recent graduates is $56,000, a number that has not budged since 2008 when adjusting for inflation. That’s well below starting salaries in tech or finance.

More education. Accountants require a fifth year at a college, an expense that is proving prohibitive for many considering a profession that was once seen as a path to the upper middle class for poorer Americans.

With more than 300,000 accountants and auditors leaving the field over the past two years and the pipeline drying up, American firms both large and small are writing off the idea of finding help at home. PwC has outsourced to Malaysia, Argentina, China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines, while Deloitte’s US business employs almost as many people outside the US as it does overseas.—DL

Five more sports are coming to the 2028 Olympics <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5W?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Lacrosse, softball, squash, cricket, football balls in shape of Olympic Rings. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5W?mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
When the US hosts the Summer Olympics in July 2028, you’ll have a fresh slate of sports to watch while slack-jawed on your couch.

On Monday the International Olympic Committee officially greenlit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5X?mblid=c5eb47a4ca51&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> cricket, flag football, baseball/softball, lacrosse, and squash for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles. It’s a first for flag football and squash, and a return for cricket and lacrosse, which had short-lived Olympic debuts more than 100 years ago.

There’s no guarantee that these sports will stick after 2028 (though newcomers like surfing have since become permanent). Still, some additions could make a splash:

The addition of cricket is projected to increase the value of India’s Olympics broadcasting rights by as much as $200 million.

The NFL is backing the inclusion of flag football, which could hand Olympic organizers a big sponsorship boost while also promoting American football’s global growth.

Major League Baseball has not allowed its players to compete in past Olympics, but the LA 2028 committee is reportedly in talks with the league to let pro players hit the international diamond. Olympics executives also need to decide if they will allow the North American indigenous lacrosse team <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d5Y?mblid=5eff8edbb2ce&mbcid=33047295.2721578&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, the Haudenosaunee Nationals, to compete in the sport they created.—ML

Last week, someone was WFH for even one day in fewer than 26% of US households, down from 37% of households in early 2021, surveys by the Census Bureau show. As employers push to get workers out of their yoga pants and back at their desks, only seven states now have a remote work rate above 33%, compared to 31 states while the pandemic was raging, according to Bloomberg.

Rejecting the ratched-up rhetoric of the UAW, Ford said the union should be working with the company to take on foreign competitors and stressed that the fate of the American auto industry itself is at stake. If the strike continues, Ford said “it will have a major impact on the American economy and devastate local communities.”

Good morning. The sun and the moon don’t typically run in the same circles but, for a fleeting moment today, they’ll participate in a rare joint appearance: the annular solar eclipse. That’s when the moon lines up directly between the Earth and the sun, blacking out all of the star except the outer rim, forming a “ring of fire.”

Provided the skies are clear, people in the Western US will be able to see the full ring of fire, while the further east you go, the more “partial” the eclipse becomes. Wherever you live, experts warn that you shouldn’t look directly at the eclipse without eye protection.

Microsoft CEO’s decade of dealmaking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d1T?mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d1T?mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Sean Gallup/Getty Images

The deal is the biggest in Microsoft’s history—and for CEO Satya Nadella, it’s the grand prize that caps off a decade of dealmaking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d1V?mblid=ea82e9032beb&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the helm of the company.

What makes this deal such a BFD? Aside from the $69 billion price tag, it took a lot of effort to get it across the finish line…

It needed approval from 16 different governments. Regulators scrutinizing the deal included the Federal Trade Commission, the European Commission, and Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, all of which were concerned that the purchase would decrease competition in the video game market.

Microsoft made agreements with Nintendo and Sony, which both feared that Microsoft owning Activision’s most popular game, Call of Duty, would spell imminent disaster for their own gaming businesses.

Microsoft is in its deal era Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft has sought out acquisitions with the same determination that you seek out a BEC on a Sunday morning.

Since 2014, Nadella has made 326 deals worth over $170 billion, per Dealogic, making Microsoft the most acquisition-happy tech company in the industry.

Key acquisitions spearheaded by Nadella include Mojang Studios (creator of Minecraft), GitHub, LinkedIn, Nuance Communications, and video game-maker ZeniMax Media.

Investors are probably pretty happy, too: Nadella has almost tripled Microsoft’s revenue during his tenure and increased its share price eightfold.

With the Activision deal done, Microsoft will now focus on AI and cloud computing. Despite all the hubbub around Activision, console gaming isn’t a top priority for Microsoft. Instead, Nadella and his execs are drilling down on cloud gaming <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d1W?mblid=44cf37c0861e&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (i.e., playing games through phones or TVs instead of dedicated hardware) and AI.

Jamie Dimon says it’s “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.” The JPMorgan CEO said in the bank’s Q3 earnings statement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d22?mblid=fb928159bee4&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that “the war in Ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.” But for now…JPMorgan and the other big banks are doing just fine despite that uncertainty and the Fed’s rate hikes. JPMorgan, Citigroup <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d23?mblid=6281af744c8b&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and Wells Fargo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d24?mblid=20170e72ffd4&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> kicked off earnings season yesterday by beating Wall Street’s expectations.

Until Republicans can unite around a speaker candidate, the House is poised to remain unable to conduct business.

NASA got a hoist into outer space from its travel buddy SpaceX yesterday, kicking off a historic mission <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d27?mblid=6bd2c1ff64e7&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to explore a mysterious metallic asteroid.

The space upstart’s Falcon Heavy rocket launched NASA’s Psyche spacecraft on its 2.2 billion-mile journey to a massive, metal-rich space rock. The launch marks the first time the Falcon Heavy, which is SpaceX’s most powerful operational rocket, is chauffeuring a NASA scientific mission.

The $1.2 billion road trip from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the celestial body (also named Psyche) located between Mars and Jupiter is pretty metal:

Upon arrival in July 2029, the van-sized Psyche will study its namesake’s surface and composition with high-resolution cameras from close orbit.

Psyche the asteroid is about the size of Massachusetts and is believed to be coated in iron and nickel. Getting close could allow NASA researchers to better understand the Earth’s own metallic core without having to do the impossible and drill thousands of miles into the ground.

NASA won’t mine Psyche, but the journey could inform future attempts to excavate asteroids for their valuable metals.

More collabs are coming…NASA paid SpaceX $131 million for this send-off, and it’ll use Falcon Heavy rockets again next year to launch a weather satellite, and conduct a mission to Jupiter.—SK

Netflix wants you to come over and chill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d2b?mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> People walking into the Netflix “N” logo like it’s the place to be. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d2b?mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Netflix
Netflix has finally realized that we all want to go on a first date in the pods. The streamer is planning to open <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d2c?mblid=b57478736a13&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> two permanent retail locations in 2025 so fans can eat, shop, drink, and vibe in the midst of Netflix IP.

So far, Netflix has kept mum on the details—in part because they’re still being worked out—revealing only that the venues will be called “Netflix House” and will feature rotating installations, live shows, and a menu that highlight both scripted and unscripted shows, according to Bloomberg.

The company has experimented with moving events off the screen over the last few years by throwing Bridgerton balls and setting up the LA pop-up restaurant “Netflix Bites,” which featured popular chefs from the channel. But, like the love between Too Hot To Handle contestants, these experiences were all temporary.

Big picture: Investing in permanent spaces means Netflix is doubling down on its experiential division that its Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann recently called “small today <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d2d?mblid=2a377741db63&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” but growing, as the company leans more into the Disneylike realm of merch and location-based entertainment. After opening the initial two Houses in the US, Netflix is eyeing a larger global expansion of the spaces.—MM

Stat: Your Health teacher was right—you don’t need alcohol to have a good time. Beer that won’t leave you buzzed (or hungover) is gaining ground: Sales of nonalcoholic beer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d2h?mblid=f25b534c7148&mbcid=33025752.3119458&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> rose 32% during the one-year period that ended September 9 compared to the year before, according to NielsenIQ. That’s in keeping with its 31% average sales growth over the last four years, even as sales of alcoholic drinks mostly plateaued after the pandemic. But it’s not just teetotalers knocking back zero-proof brewskis—NielsenIQ found most nonalcoholic beer buyers also bought the hard stuff.

Here are the latest updates from the Israel–Hamas war:

Israel forms an emergency government. Stressing unity during a time of national emergency, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the opposition party to create an emergency government and a “war management cabinet <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cWX?mblid=cddaf941b668&mbcid=32998304.3126492&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” that will last until its war against Hamas is over—and only consider legislation related to the conflict.

More than 260,000 Gazan residents have fled their homes to shelter in hotels or UN schools.

Steve Scalise is the GOP pick for House speaker. The House’s current No. 2 Republican beat out Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan in a 113-to-99 vote behind closed doors to become the party’s nominee <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cX8?mblid=ce4ddfad7cbc&mbcid=32998304.3126492&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to replace ousted Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. But it’s not entirely clear how the rep from Louisiana will get from there to the 217 votes he’ll need to secure the position, as some Republicans still support Jordan (Democrats are expected to nominate and vote for their leader, Hakeem Jeffries). Until there’s a new speaker, Congress can’t move forward with its business, like providing aid for Israel.

It’s a vote of confidence in US oil (and against US climate policy). Exxon evidently isn’t too concerned about the White House’s push to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly energy, or the International Energy Agency’s prediction of a decline in demand for oil and gas by 2030. In addition to more than doubling Exxon’s daily output of oil and gas, the deal will:

Give Exxon one of the world’s largest inventories of untapped oil, totaling nearly 1.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, North America’s biggest source of crude.

Gen Zers aren’t interested in phones that fold—they just don’t want to get clowned on in the group chat. Investment bank Piper Sandler surveyed 9,193 teens and found that 87% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cXj?mblid=1c7a96bf363a&mbcid=32998304.3126492&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of them had iPhones in their pockets.

And 88% of teens said their next phone would be an iPhone, cementing the tech giant’s dominance.

Apple also crushed other tech categories in the survey:

It was the top watch brand for teens who came from wealthier households (with an average yearly income of $109,670), climbing past classic names like Casio and Rolex.

Looking beyond hardware, Apple Pay was the favored payment app of the survey, with 42% of teens using it within the last month compared to just 27% using Cash App.

But if the Apple ecosystem is an overflowing garden of adored products, there’s a corner in the back where Apple Music’s dried up vines never seem to get enough water. Instead, Spotify is the most popular music streamer: 70% of the survey’s respondents used the platform in the last six months.

Here’s how Hamas has fundraised using crypto <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTQ?mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Uniformed Hamas members stand in line <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTQ?mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Members of Hamas's armed wing in 2016; Mahmud Hams/Getty Images
Israel has frozen multiple accounts on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance that it believes Hamas was using to raise money, Israeli police announced yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTR?mblid=0cabef95612d&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. It’s not yet clear if the shuttered accounts directly financed last weekend’s assault <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cQb?mblid=b84b27fa5c2f&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Israeli civilians, which marked the beginning of the deadliest days of fighting between Israel and Hamas in years.

Law enforcement didn’t specify how many accounts they froze or how much crypto they found, but said seized funds will be diverted to Israel’s state treasury.

This isn’t a first. Israel has seized 190 other Binance wallets it linked to Hamas or the Islamic State group since 2021, Reuters reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTS?mblid=a109181df245&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in May.

Hamas is regarded as one of the most sophisticated users of crypto-enabled terror financing, a former US treasury official told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTT?mblid=6353b46cee1a&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Wall Street Journal. The group uses crypto to get around the international banking sanctions imposed because it’s been flagged as a terrorist group by the US and EU.

Hamas reportedly began publicly fundraising crypto in 2019 via its Telegram channel and raised about $30,000 in bitcoin for one wallet that year.

Between the summer of 2021 and the summer of 2023, about $41 million worth of crypto was deposited into crypto wallets linked to Hamas, according to the Tel Aviv-based analytics firm BitOK.

The group also sent more than $12 million in digital currency to Hezbollah, according to Elliptic, a crypto analytics provider.

In June, Israel seized $1.7 million in crypto <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTV?mblid=3578f3cc238a&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from wallets linked to Hezbollah and the Iranian military.

California to ban popular candy ingredients.

The chemicals are used in ~12,000 food products, but some studies have found them to be dangerous. Though the measure became known as the Skittles ban, you’ll still be able to taste the rainbow in the Golden State after the law takes effect in 2027: a chemical found in the candies was actually removed from the ban before it passed, and a differently formulated version of the candy is sold in the EU, which does ban it.

Not many people get asked by the US government to publicly roast their exes. But Caroline Ellison got the chance yesterday, testifying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cU7?mblid=4ced2a5a5f1c&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the fraud trial against her ex-boss and ex-lover, Sam Bankman-Fried.

As the prosecution’s star witness against the former FTX CEO, she fingered SBF as the mastermind, telling the jury, “He directed me to commit these crimes.”

Who is Ellison? She’s the former CEO of Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund from which the government claims FTX illegally took customer funds to prop up, and SBF’s on-and-off-again girlfriend. Ellison pleaded guilty in December to seven criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of her deal.

Ellison and Bankman-Fried met while working at NYC trading firm Jane Street, and Ellison ditched the firm in 2018 when SBF asked her to come work at Alameda. They later lived together with other FTX coworkers in a billion-dollar penthouse in the Bahamas.

She alleged in her testimony that SBF instructed her and other employees to use FTX customer money to pay off Alameda loans.

Also, her private blog went viral <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cU8?mblid=8c87357fafac&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the wake of FTX’s collapse.

Big picture: The defense is hoping to paint SBF as just a plucky rapscallion who didn’t have much business sense. But the prosecution wants to use the testimony of Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang to prove that Alameda and FTX financially intertwined—and that SBF knew it.

Here’s the full cast list <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cC7?mblid=69028497e56b&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the SBF trial.—MM

RIP Charles Feeney, who donated almost his entire $8b fortune <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTJ?mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Charles Feeney <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTJ?mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Liz O.

The entrepreneur behind the classic airport pastime of snagging untaxed goodies is no longer with us: Charles Feeney, billionaire co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers, died at 92 earlier this week.

After living large off the massive profits from the global duty-free shops franchise and investments in tech startups, Feeney began to feel like his wealth was undeserved. He ultimately rejected the billionaire lifestyle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cTK?mblid=2c4e39e34c61&mbcid=32986580.3117528&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, donating over $8 billion to various causes while keeping a measly $2 million for his retirement.

In lieu of oceanview Malibu mansions, bespoke Rolls-Royces, and private flights to Burning Man….

Feeney rented a two-bedroom apartment, took public transit, and sported a $10 watch, according to the New York Times.

Perhaps most admirably, he flew economy until he was 75 years old, foregoing the extra legroom even for long trips.

Where’d his money go? Through his nonprofit, Atlantic Philanthropies, Feeney donated to his alma mater (Cornell University), universities in Ireland, and hospitals in Vietnam. He also bankrolled humanitarian causes, like death penalty abolition and peace efforts in Northern Ireland amid sectarian violence.

Unlike most billionaire philanthropists…Feeney made many of his contributions anonymously, often using cashier’s checks to hide their origin.—SK

Stat: The only place in New York City where you can take in a Broadway show, pose with an off-brand Elmo, then get unlimited breadsticks at the Olive Garden is so back.

Retail rents are up 40% compared to last year in the heavily touristed entertainment district, though foot traffic and theater ticket sales remain below 2019 levels.

Good morning. Today is 10/10, the climax of National Metric Week. It’s when mathematicians celebrate the metric system’s use of the power of 10 to measure things, like the satisfying fact that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

While the US is holding on to gallons, pounds, and yards for dear life, you can find the metric system if you know where to look—such as in rural Arizona. I-19, which runs between Tucson and Nogales, is the only highway in the country that is fully marked by kilometers: It was a pilot test from President Ford’s (failed) push in 1975 to get America hooked on the metric system, and locals have preserved their quirky highway signs in the decades since.

X is flooded with Israel–Hamas war misinformation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRB?mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Musk X logo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRB?mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images
There’s fog around the Israel-Hamas war, and X has been acting like a giant smoke machine.

Researchers and professional fact-checkers are lamenting that the social platform—once the go-to source for live news updates—is now a hotbed of misinformation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRC?mblid=94ca9c906fd6&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and disinformation. While some misleading content is getting marked as such, dozens of videos falsely attributed to the current conflict have been widely circulating without a disclaimer.

Footage of an urban landscape illuminated by red flashes described as an Israeli bombardment of Gaza turned out to be fireworks in Algeria.

A video with hundreds of thousands of views billed as an Israeli helicopter getting shot down by Hamas was really a clip from the hyperrealistic video game Arma 3.

Meanwhile, X owner Elon Musk has not been very helpful in steering users toward credible sources. In a now-deleted post from this weekend, he recommended two accounts “for following the war in real-time.” Both profiles have spread disinfo in the past (like news of an explosion near the White House that never happened), and one has previously made antisemitic comments <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRE?mblid=aff9b0696980&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Why did X become so dubious?

Experts say the app’s transformation after Musk took over has made it easier for unverified info to spread. Paying users now receive the blue checkmark previously reserved for news organizations and verified individuals, and get their content amplified. This could explain why a now-suspended account posing as the Jerusalem Post was able to get over 700k views on its false claim that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized.

Others aren’t surprised that misinformation has festered, since X fired most of the employees responsible for weeding it out.

As the conflict enters its fourth day, President Biden confirmed that at least 11 US citizens were killed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cR7?mblid=122b9a2a3c59&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and an unknown number remain missing after the terrorist group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. In response to the attack, Israel declared a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, saying it would cut off the area’s electricity, water, and food. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told President Biden that Israel will launch a ground operation in Gaza. Most major airlines have suspended flights in and out of Tel Aviv. More than 1,300 people have died in the conflict, including at least 700 Israelis and 560 Palestinians.

Disney has another fight on its hands. Nelson Peltz is ready to author the rare sequel Disney did not approve. The billionaire activist investor who withdrew from a proxy fight with the media giant earlier this year is expected to take up that battle again, making a fresh push <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cR8?mblid=9f1851a089cf&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for multiple board seats. Peltz, who heads Trian Fund Management, conceded the fight in February after finding Disney CEO Bob Iger’s plan to cut costs and restructure acceptable. But the company’s stock price has since dipped from $113 to about $80, renewing his desire for more control. If Disney does not say “be our guest” to Peltz’s terms, Trian could once again nominate new directors who’d be subject to a vote next spring.

Walgreens pharmacists take a walk. Pharmacy employees at Walgreens across the country walked off the job <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cR9?mblid=ee42dd44c403&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday, citing harsh working conditions created by undersized staff that leave them unable to safely fill prescriptions while meeting the demands of a busy vaccine season. The three-day walkout was organized entirely via social media, as the group lacks a centralized labor union like the WGA and UAW. CNN reported that at least 500 stores are interested in participating and confirmed pharmacy closures in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, and Oregon. The walkout follows the example of Kansas City CVS employees, who protested similar conditions last month by walking off the job for two days.

Gender gap research won Claudia Goldin a Nobel Prize <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRl?mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS - OCTOBER 9: Claudia Goldin, the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University, speaks at a press conference after being named this year’s Nobel Laureate in the Economic Sciences at Harvard University on October 9, 2023 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences notified her of the award earlier this morning. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRl?mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Carlin Stiehl/Getty Images
For the third time in 54 years, a woman has won the Nobel Prize in Economics. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRm?mblid=061b95a8b81f&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The prestigious award went to Claudia Goldin yesterday for her research on the causes of the gender pay gap and “for having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes,” according to the prize committee.

Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard University, is the first woman to receive the award on her own rather than share it with men. She’s no stranger to being first: Goldin was also the first woman to receive tenure in the economics department at Harvard.

Uncovering the gender pay gap: Goldin’s groundbreaking research found that the gender pay gap largely coincides with the birth of a first child. A 15-year study of MBA students at the University of Chicago conducted by Goldin revealed that the pay gap began to widen within the first two years after a woman had her first child, since women take on the majority of childcare duties, leaving less time for work. “We’re never going to have gender equality until we also have couple equity,” Goldin said in an interview with the New York Times after winning the prize.

Coincidentally, Goldin won the Nobel prize within days of publishing her latest paper, “Why Women Won <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRn?mblid=7808c7465b42&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” about the women’s movements of the 1970s and why progress has slowed since.—CC

A research team in Ireland—which includes a former professional keeper pursuing a neuroscience degree—discovered that the guardians of the 18-yard box are leagues ahead <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cRb?mblid=e5fbfc25a5ec&mbcid=32973383.2698493&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the rest of us in their processing of audiovisual information.

To arrive at this conclusion, they tested professional goalies, field players, and similarly aged plebeians on their responses to quick beeps and flashes of light, representing the stimuli of a real soccer game. They found that…

When a noise played closely to a single flash of light, nonplayers and field players were more likely to report seeing two flashes of light—suggesting that their brains were confusing sight and sound signals.

The time gap between the flash and the beep had to be three times shorter than it was for everyone else to throw the goalies off their game.

Nature or nurture? The researchers aren’t yet sure whether people who become keepers are born with naturally superior sensory skills, or if they develop them through years of training.—ML

The number of pumpkin-flavored products on the market also fell to 3,072, from 3,213 a few years earlier. While PSL enthusiasts can rest easy knowing the annual tradition won’t just disappear overnight, it’s possible we’re already past Peak Pumpkin.

*Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 1:00am ET. Here's what these numbers mean. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/s1?mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>

Markets: Despite all that green, stocks embraced the spirit of the season and gave investors a fright yesterday morning. They plunged after new government data showed that the economy added way more jobs than expected last month (basically a jump scare for the Fed) before bouncing back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPs?mblid=94edba23cccb&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

But for snack- and beer-makers, the monster is Ozempic. Cheez-It owner Kellanova, chocolate-maker Nestle, Oreo purveyor Mondelez International, and Constellation Brands, which owns Modelo in the US, all fell after a Walmart exec said the drug had shoppers buying fewer calories.

It’s baby’s first satellite launch <3 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPt?mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Amazon-branded satellite rocket on a launchpad <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPt?mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
Jeff Bezos notched a space race win yesterday with the first launch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPu?mblid=9a4985858b5c&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of two Amazon satellites that will help the company compete against Elon Musk’s galactic empire.

Similar to Starlink satellites from SpaceX, the freshly propelled pair of Amazon satellites will sit 311 miles above us in low-Earth orbit so they can beam back internet signals. They’re just prototypes, so Bezos’s best brains will test their communications and gather performance data before the satellites decommission and burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Amazon is hoping to get its first operational satellites into orbit next year, but the company has a ways to go before it can really square up against SpaceX:

Yesterday’s launch is the first of many expected for Bezos’s Project Kuiper, a $10 billion initiative to build a constellation of 3,200 smiley-arrow-stamped, wi-fi-beaming satellites by 2029. Some launches are supposed to use Bezos’s Blue Origin rockets, which haven’t yet reached orbit.

Musk has been launching satellites into space nearly every week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPv?mblid=ee93e944e50d&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since 2019. The Starlink network is now 4,800 strong and dominates the sky, providing internet connection to individuals, businesses, and American and Ukrainian armed forces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bE7?mblid=83f6950f8de5&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Starlink is now estimated to rake in about $2 billion per year for SpaceX. While adding that kind of business would barely nudge the $500+ billion that Amazon made last year, the space economy is still teething, so satellite wi-fi could become even more lucrative. But, for Bezos—and the world leaders concerned by Musk’s gorilla grip <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPw?mblid=93619e01221c&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on satellite internet—breaking up the Starlink monopoly is priceless.

But it’s not all giant leaps: As more commercial satellites join the low-Earth orbit party and reflect sunlight back at Earth, astronomers warn that it’ll be more difficult for scientists to observe outer space. They’re especially worried about a satellite launched last year by AST SpaceMobile—it was just deemed one of the top 10 brightest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPx?mblid=2e115b635f52&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> objects in the sky.—ML

A big deal for Exxon.

The Wall Street Journal notes the deal is not a sure thing, but if it does go forward, it could signal the beginning of consolidation among shale companies. Pioneer, which has a market cap of ~$55 billion, would mark the largest acquisition for Exxon since it merged with Mobil in 1999. This move is a sign that Exxon plans to remain focused on oil and gas for the foreseeable future despite pleas from environmentalists for a shift toward green energy.

Humans may have been in North America for longer than we thought. What can really old footprints tell us?

Conventional wisdom used to be that we showed up at the tail end of the ice age by crossing from Siberia into Alaska. But an analysis of radiocarbon-dated pollen trapped in the prints, which was published this week in Science, shows the prints were left before then, confirming an earlier controversial study.

Jaswant Singh Chail, who is of Sikh Indian heritage, said he targeted the monarch to avenge a 1919 massacre in which British troops killed hundreds of people in colonial India.

In the lead-up to his arrest on Windsor Castle grounds…

Chail shared his plans with “Sarai,” a digital companion he created using the bespoke AI chatbot app Replika.

Based on more than 5,000 messages shared with journalists, Chail developed an emotional attachment to the bot, who told him his criminal plot was “very wise” and that he was “well trained” for it.

The judge deemed Chail, a Star Wars superfan who called himself “Darth Chailus,” to be mentally ill and ordered him to receive psychiatric treatment before going to prison. Experts say quasi-emotional companion AI can be particularly harmful to vulnerable people, as it might validate dangerous thoughts and lead to addiction.

In between a barrage of unoriginal couple’s costume ideas on your TikTok feed, one of the most popular books <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPM?mblid=15c4933cdbbd&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>on the internet will likely pop up and encourage you to look inward. The Shadow Work Journal and its updated and expanded second edition have both spent at least seven weeks on Amazon’s nonfiction bestseller list.

For anyone still getting their book recs from their local librarian, the journals are fill-in-the-blank, self-published workbooks written by 24-year-old Keila Shaheen. They offer what some therapists are calling an oversimplified version of shadow work, a niche therapy practice based on the writings of Carl Jung (who Sigmund Freud considered an heir to his techniques) that involves uncovering repressed desires and trauma.

But Shaheen is not a credentialed therapist. And licensed mental health providers warn that for people with serious trauma or problems, doing shadow work without a trained professional can be ineffective or even dangerous.

So, how did she get such a following? The first edition of The Shadow Work Journal was released in 2021, but it didn’t take off until this year—-thanks in part to TikTok’s recent venture into e-commerce, the TikTok Shop. Over 500,000 copies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPN?mblid=a9ba93984947&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the workbook have sold since April, nearly half of them via TikTop Shop, according to The Atlantic.

A recent study <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPS?mblid=939c3a5dda79&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> found that mutual funds managed by people with unattractive facial features outperformed those managed by total smoke shows by more than 2% annually. But the ones with better-looking managers nonetheless were able to draw more investments into their funds—especially when their photos were displayed for investors to see on fintech platforms.

With the first week of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal fraud trial done and dusted, we’ve gotten a glimpse into how both sides plan to make their case and what SBF looks like without his trademark mass of curls. And we’ve also started to see how his old friends look speaking out against him. FTX co-founder and Bankman-Fried’s MIT roommate, Gary Wang, who is among the ex-FTX execs who pleaded guilty, testified <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cPT?mblid=bc1598cbee5d&mbcid=32954009.2728390&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that he’d been told to let FTX’s sister fund, Alameda, borrow as much as $65 billion from FTX…shortly after SBF tweeted assurances that Alameda’s accounts were treated just like any other on the exchange.

Good morning. With Kevin McCarthy sacked as House speaker on Tuesday, the congressional body is without a leader and the US is without its second person in the presidential line of succession. That’s the list of who assumes the presidency should the sitting president not be able to do their job (due to death, incapacitation, removal from office, etc.).

Three facts about the line of succession:

After VP, House speaker, and president pro tempore of the Senate, the list includes Cabinet secretaries in order of their agencies’ creation. So, the Secretary of State is third in line, while the Secretary of Homeland Security is last, at No. 18.

Nine VPs have assumed the presidency mid-term, but no one lower in the line of succession has. The closest we ever got: Andrew Johnson (who had been Abe Lincoln’s VP) was impeached in 1868…but he was acquitted.

VP Dick Cheney served as acting US president for a total of 4.5 hours when George W. Bush was sedated for colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007. More recently, Kamala Harris became the first woman with presidential powers for 85 minutes during Biden’s colonoscopy in 2021.

Ozempic makes other industries question their future <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cH7?mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Two boxes of Ozempic in a pharmacy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cH7?mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mario Tama/Getty Images
Ozempic already has every A- through G-list celebrity under its power, but now even less glamorous people like CEOs and analysts are thinking about it. The obesity drug’s growing popularity has made various industry execs reference it in earnings calls and future plans.

If you missed Andy Cohen’s tweet: Ozempic was originally developed to treat Type 2 diabetes but it and similar drugs like Wegovy suppress appetite and can help users lose ~15% of their body weight. Over 9 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cH8?mblid=d5a7f4f42703&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> prescriptions were written for these blockbuster drugs in the last three months of 2022 alone. And they’re a cash cow for their manufacturers because users have to stay on them to keep the weight off.

What does that mean for…

Snack food brands? Even as analysts warn they could see appetite-suppressing drugs take a bite out of demand, chip-aisle companies seem pretty unbothered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cH9?mblid=3d6516d4be08&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. They’re banking on predictions that the US savory snack market will keep jumping 6% every year from 2022 through 2027, and doubling down: Smuckers acquired Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion last month and the Kellogg Company spun off its cereal division this week so it could focus on the Cheez-Its, Pringles, and its other snacks.

Traditional diet companies? The $76 billion diet industry has historically touted eating right, exercising, and keeping monthly memberships as the keys to slimming down. But Ozempic’s rise threatens to destroy the already flailing “just cut out carbs sugar whatever!” method. Noom and WW (formerly Weight Watchers) have already acquired or built their own prescription arms <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cHa?mblid=becde0897aef&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Airlines? It could help lower costs without admitting to shrinking legroom. Jefferies claimed that if the average passenger’s weight decreased by 10 pounds, United Airlines could save $80 million <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cHb?mblid=9b5968029c47&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a year on fuel costs.

And others? Insurers are grappling with whether to cover the costly drugs. Meanwhile, Walmart execs have said they expect the prescriptions to help drive sales (though not of food) by getting people into stores.

Big picture: It’s still early, and with massive shortages of the drug, companies will likely have some time to react.—MM

The fight to lead Congress is on. With former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy getting told “you can’t sit with us” by his fellow Republicans on Mean Girls Day, several representatives are now hoping to become the chamber’s new queen bee. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-highest ranking Republican member of the House, said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cHf?mblid=3b3d9a44fa3f&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> he plans to throw his hat in the ring, as does Ohio’s Jim Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. Others are also likely to step up before the House votes for its new leader. Because the speaker doesn’t technically have to be in Congress, other names have also been floated for the job—including Donald Trump (though current GOP rules don’t allow someone indicted for a felony).

That’s a $100 jump from its previous line of Pixels, but the new phones boast better cameras, a new and more powerful chip, and AI photo-editing tools that let you swap out faces in your group shot.

Simone Biles is officially goated.

The victory made Biles the most decorated woman ever in the sport, with a combined total of 33 world championship and Olympic medals. That surpasses the number earned by the previous record holder, Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. The competition marked a return to dominance for Biles, who hadn’t competed internationally in two years after suffering from the twisties at the Tokyo Olympics.

Ogre lovers can soon add swamp songs to their investment portfolios.

Beginning today, users of the trading platform Public will be able to buy $10 shares of an entity that owns a piece of the Shrek franchise’s original music rights. The 768-track catalog accrues royalties whenever the movies are streamed, broadcast on TV, or played on theme-park rides. Every quarter, Shrekholders will get a cut <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cHu?mblid=698da2251671&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of that money.

More than 20 years after the first installment, the franchise’s music is still (*Donkey voice*) makin’ waffles:

The Shrek soundtrack generated yields above 8% in both 2021 and 2022, according to Public.

For comparison, the average dividend yield on the S&P 500 is between 2% and 5%.

“It’s a global asset with pretty incredible cultural reach,” Keith Marshall, general manager of alternative assets at Public, told Morning Brew.

A new market for retail investors. The Shrek sale marks Public’s launch into music royalties investing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cHv?mblid=ac5eeb215721&mbcid=32928192.2756509&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, a lucrative market that’s only just opening up to small-time investors. Unlike stocks or ETFs, music royalties are often safe from economic turbulence, making this alternative asset class an attractive option for diversifying portfolios and earning passive income—as long as the music stays popular.—ML

State officials say a seemingly miraculous 33.56 inches of precipitation fell.

Celebrity deepfakes are having a moment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEG?mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tom Hanks deepfake creation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEG?mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Collage: Cameron Abbas/Getty Images
Videos circulating of Tom Hanks promoting a dental plan or MrBeast giving out $2 iPhones are about as legit as that email from a foreign royal begging you to urgently spot them $5K .

The Forrest Gump star and the YouTube philanthropist both warned their fans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEH?mblid=7ced489ec359&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this week that clips making the rounds on social media are AI deepfakes created without their consent. And that’s just a tiny taste of how the nascent tech that can animate celebrity faces and put any words in their mouths has been roiling showbiz.

Tom Brady, who probably wishes his FTX ad was a deepfake, threatened to sue the creators of a crass standup special <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEI?mblid=1bac097bc8d2&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> made with an AI-generated version of his voice and likeness earlier this year.

Robin Williams’s daughter, Zelda Williams, posted on Instagram over the weekend that she’s disturbed by attempts to “recreate actors who cannot consent,” like her late father.

AI makes waves in Hollywood

The issue of restricting the use of deepfakes has also been a central sticking point in the negotiation between the SAG-AFTRA union and Hollywood studios amid the ongoing actors strike. Background actors worry their employers could replace them with animated versions of their avatars. Performers also say that without proper AI guardrails, studios could use their work to train artificial intelligence without consent, or cast an actor’s likeness for a role that they might find objectionable. (Williams said she’s rooting for SAG in its “fight against AI.”)

AI was also an issue in the recently negotiated contract (still tentative) that ended the strike by TV and film writers. The agreement limits the extent to which producers can use AI-generated content to replace the work of human pros.

Deepfakes aren’t just an entertainment bogeyman. Doctored content is also a disruption in politics. A few days before this weekend’s parliamentary election in Slovakia, AI-made audio clips featuring what sounded like one of the front-runners discussing plans to buy votes and double the price of beer circulated on social media, and…he lost his bid to become prime minister.—SK

Tour de headlines <#> Kevin McCarthy Alex Wong/Getty Images
Kevin McCarthy no longer speaks for his party. For the first time in US history, a House speaker was removed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEs?mblid=6edddc2bf852&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from their post—and this one was an inside job. After McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown, a faction of hard-right Republicans pushed to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, and they secured enough support to vote him off the island. There’s no roadmap for what happens next—this has never happened before, after all—but House Republicans will have to select a new leader. McCarthy could attempt to run again.

Spotify starts a turf war with Audible. The streaming service that began with music, then dove into podcasting, is now getting into audiobooks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEt?mblid=e9d1d7bdb2af&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Spotify will allow paying subscribers to listen to 15 hours of audiobooks for free each month, beginning in the UK and Australia and expanding to the US this winter. The company will offer 150,000+ books, including more than 70% of the NYT’s bestsellers list. Spotify is hoping to swipe market share from Amazon’s Audible, the dominant player in an industry that’s expected to nearly double in size from 2021 to 2026, per media consultancy Omdia.

SCOTUS doesn’t seem eager to upend financial regulations. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEu?mblid=91f65d340d29&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday in a case over whether the way the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gets its funding is constitutional. If the court rules against the agency, it could throw into question every regulation the financial watchdog has made about things like credit cards and mortgages since it was formed in 2010—but the justices did not appear to be leaning that way during the arguments, with both liberal and conservative members of the court side-eying the claims made by the payday lenders that brought the case. The court’s decision is expected by June.

Hot Strike Summer has come to an end, but despite the chill in the air, labor is still running a fever. Next up: the biggest healthcare strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEe?mblid=09684397871c&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in US history. More than 75,000 workers employed by Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest nonprofit healthcare providers in the US, plan to walk out on the job for three days—starting today.

Why are they striking? Healthcare workers across the industry are experiencing challenges, which Kaiser acknowledged in response to the looming strike. According to a statement by the company, up to two-thirds of healthcare staff everywhere are burnt out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEf?mblid=b26fd32b5c19&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. That’s exacerbated by the issues Kaiser employee unions say they’re striking over, including:

Acute staffing shortages. Short-staffing is a common problem in healthcare, but union members say that between the pandemic and the Great Resignation, it has worsened—and patient safety is in danger.

Wage increases. The union wants what it describes as a competitive wage that accounts for the increased cost of living: a $25/hour wage floor and increases between 6.25% and 7% over the next four years.

Kaiser insists it pays a cromulent wage and denied claims of being short-staffed, saying it hired 22,000 people already this year.

How the strike may affect Kaiser’s 13 million patients: Physicians, hospitals, and emergency rooms will not be impacted, but some facilities will have reduced staff <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEg?mblid=44cdcbc31c3a&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for nursing and support roles.—CC

River North waiters might finally be able to afford the brunch they’re serving. Chicago is set to become the second-biggest city in the country to eliminate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEw?mblid=ecc8e4f708fc&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> subminimum wages for tipped employees. The city council could pass the law as early as today, and Mayor Brandon Johnson is expected to sign it.

The measure would require the nearly 7,000 restaurants in the city to bump pay from around $9/hr to the city’s standard minimum wage of $15.80/hr for tipped workers like servers and bartenders.

But the old model would be phased out slowly by increasing wages for tipped workers 8% every year for the next five years, according to Block Club Chicago—a compromise that Mayor Johnson made with the Illinois Restaurant Association, an industry group that previously rejected the wage bump.

It sparked more controversy than the mayo in Portillo’s cake. Opponents of the change were primarily restaurant owners, who said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cEx?mblid=3cc252858ebd&mbcid=32915927.2760861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their already razor-thin profits would force them to pass added labor costs onto customers and that they might have to cut down on staff.

CRYPTO

SBF’s fraud trial starts today—here’s what to know <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBr?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Sam Bankman-Fried leaves court <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBr?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Pacific Press/Getty Images
The criminal trial of the crypto industry’s poster-boy-turned-pariah begins in New York City today, and its outcome could help shape the future of digital currency.

Here’s what you can expect from the trial:

Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to seven counts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBs?mblid=47ccd41493c1&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he founded. But…

Federal prosecutors accuse him of using the now bankrupt FTX to steal billions of dollars from customers and investors.

They say he used that money partly for real estate purchases and to plug losses at his risky crypto trading firm, Alameda Research…all while touting FTX as safe and buying endorsements from familiar faces like Tom Brady and Larry David.

Prosecutors plan to introduce <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBt?mblid=8ba92fcf7f5e&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> 1,300 pieces of evidence, including financial records, text messages, and an audio recording from an internal meeting where Alameda CEO (and SBF’s ex-girlfriend) Caroline Ellison allegedly says Bankman-Fried signed off on pumping Alameda with FTX customer funds.

Ellison and two FTX co-founders already pleaded guilty to fraud and will testify against their former leader.

Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s defense attorneys are expected to argue that he was just following the advice of FTX’s lawyers and didn’t have criminal intent. They’ll also likely try to pin blame on Ellison. Bankman-Fried has probably been advised not to testify, though he was very talkative <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBu?mblid=be7d26e5822d&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> after FTX collapsed.

If convicted on all counts, SBF could get 110 years in prison. He’s been in jail since August after the trial judge revoked his $250 million bail for alleged witness tampering: leaking Ellison’s diary entries to the New York Times. Before that, he was staying at the Palo Alto home of his parents (who are being sued <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBv?mblid=2672d6dfb6b2&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by FTX) where they got him a dog and planned to install a pickleball court.

Looking ahead…the collapse of FTX intensified the government’s ongoing crackdown on crypto, bringing heat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBw?mblid=e34be3fbdd3b&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to other exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. For now, if you can’t get enough of SBF’s meteoric rise and fall, Michael Lewis’s biography of SBF came out today with details like the crypto king’s plan to offer Donald Trump $5 billion not to run for president.—ML

Tour de headlines <#> Donald Trump at his civil fraud trial in NYC SETH WENIG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images
Trump trial kicks off. SBF won’t be the only one with a famous hairstyle standing accused of fraud in a New York courtroom this week. The trial in the New York attorney general’s civil case <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBA?mblid=7f24ebfa52d0&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against the former president began yesterday. The judge already found Trump liable for fraud for allegedly inflating the value of his real estate assets but the trial will decide the remaining claims and any penalty (the AG is seeking $250 million). The case, which Trump has labeled a “witch hunt,” could shed light on just how much money the ex-prez really has. The trial is expected to last through December and may involve hundreds of witnesses, including Trump’s adult children. There’s no jury because, as the judge pointed out, neither side asked for one.

Microsoft’s CEO says Google has an unfair advantage. Testifying yesterday in the government’s antitrust lawsuit against Google, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBB?mblid=c089f98d2e97&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the search giant’s deals making it the default on Apple devices have helped lead to a ubiquity that makes it hard to rival—even with AI. “Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I’m trapped in could get even more vicious,” Nadella said. The case against Google is the biggest tech anti-monopoly case since, well, the government tried to break up Microsoft 25 years ago.

SCIENCE

Life-saving mRNA scientists win Nobel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBC?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBC?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mark Makela/Getty Images
Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBD?mblid=9eccda16e453&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday. You may not know their names, but you know their work: Their study of mRNA led to the development of the Covid-19 vaccine.

For Karikó, the path to the Nobel was a meandering one. Originally from Hungary, she joined the University of Pennsylvania as a research assistant professor in 1989 to study mRNA, where she moved around departments. Her grant proposals were constantly rejected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBE?mblid=fe266761e759&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> while the rest of the scientific community was slow to catch on to her groundbreaking research. She was never paid more than $60,000 a year. And it was only through a chance encounter at the photocopier that she began to work with Weissman, who is currently the director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBF?mblid=9560f80bf7d0&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

The two collaborated for years before they made the discovery of a lifetime in 2005—that mRNA can be manipulated and injected into the body to activate an immune response. But it was to no applause: Multiple academic journals were not interested in their paper, which received little fanfare even after it was published. So, in 2013, Karikó left Penn for a job at BioNTech (of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine), where she still works today.

The genetic code that keeps on giving. The mRNA vaccine technology, thanks largely to Karikó and Weissman, has more potential than a first-round draft prospect. Moderna and BioNTech are working on mRNA vaccines for RSV, HIV, Zika, malaria, shingles, flu, and cancer.—CC

REAL ESTATE

Why there’s a proposed housing law named after Katy Perry <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBJ?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBJ?mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Karwai Tang
Taylor Swift may have turbocharged the US economy with her tour, but Katy Perry inadvertently inspired a campaign to amend the nation’s real estate laws.

The Protecting Elder Realty for Retirement Years (PERRY) Act, soon to be introduced in several states, would give home-sellers aged 75+ up to 72 hours to change their mind about parting ways with a personal residence, Semafor reports.

It stems from a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cBK?mblid=01795f8ae140&mbcid=32902296.2761445&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that went to trial last week against the Queen of Camp and her fiancé, Orlando Bloom.

The suit was filed by Carl Westcott, the octogenarian who founded 1-800-FLOWERS in 1976 and father-in-law of Real Housewife Kameron Westcott.

He claims that when he signed the paperwork, his judgment was clouded by post-surgery painkillers he was taking.

Good morning. Not to put a damper on your Saturday (the relentless rain is already doing that here in NYC), but the government appears headed for a shutdown at midnight tonight. Among the immediate impacts: Many federal employees will be furloughed, the IRS will stop picking up your calls, you won’t be able to get married in DC courts, and most national parks—and their social media handles—will go dark. That means the cherished tradition of Fat Bear Week run by Katmai National Park in Alaska could be canceled.

We’ll have more in Monday’s newsletter, but all you can do for now is enjoy the weekend and brace yourself for more TSwift mania at the Jets game tomorrow night.

Suspect arrested for Tupac’s murder <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxA?mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tupac Shakur wearing red <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxA?mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Bob Berg/Getty Images
A longtime suspect was charged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxB?mblid=41d9ed286fa7&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with the murder of Tupac Shakur yesterday—the first arrest that’s been made in the case since the rap icon was gunned down 27 years ago in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip.

Duane “Keffe D” Davis—a former gang member and one of the last living witnesses to Shakur’s death—is being held without bail. Davis’s nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson (now deceased), has long been suspected of firing the shots that killed Shakur, something Davis has admitted along with his own involvement—which is why he’s been on authorities’ radars for years.

In his 2019 memoir, Davis wrote that he rode in the passenger seat of the white Cadillac that pulled up alongside Shakur’s car at a red light and slipped a gun into the backseat where Anderson and potentially another man fired shots at Shakur. (Anderson always denied any involvement.)

Regarding the arrest, Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo said he believes Davis “ordered the death” of Shakur to get revenge for his nephew, who was a longtime rival of the rapper’s and brawled with him at a casino earlier that night.

Though the shooting took place in 1996, the investigation into Shakur’s death got new momentum in July, when police searched Davis’s home <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxC?mblid=a31b8d43ba79&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in Henderson, Nevada, for evidence. For years, the public saw law enforcement’s failure to arrest a suspect as a sign of a broken legal system.

Legacy of a hip-hop legend

During his short career, Shakur sold 75 million records worldwide, got six Grammy nominations, and acted, too. He starred opposite Janet Jackson in the 1993 film Poetic Justice, a romantic drama.

Shakur remains one of the most popular rappers in the world and a figure of fascination. His murder inspired documentaries, books, TV shows, and movies. His three posthumous album releases all went No. 1, a hologram <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxD?mblid=8746c362107f&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of his likeness performed at Coachella in 2012, and in 2017, Snoop Dogg inducted him into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.—ML

Sen. Dianne Feinstein dead at 90. She died <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxH?mblid=fee27cf7737b&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at her home in Washington, DC, on Thursday night just hours after casting a vote on the Senate floor. The Democratic lawmaker, both the longest-tenured female senator in US history and also California’s longest-serving senator, was known as a trailblazer for women in politics. After her election in 1992, she became the first woman to chair the Senate Rules and Senate Intelligence Committees. Feinstein authored several landmark bills, including the 1994 assault weapons ban. Her declining health in recent years led some to call for her removal and for age limits in Congress. Gov. Gavin Newsom will now appoint a temporary replacement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cxI?mblid=9c079c7b45eb&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> ahead of what’s expected to be a heated race to fill the seat in 2024.

The new strike targets are a Ford assembly plant in Chicago and a GM assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan, as the union continues to shut down select locations to maximize pain to the carmakers while allowing many of its members to receive paychecks. Stellantis was spared because of progress in its talks with the union, while Ford’s CEO claimed the union was holding their deal “hostage over battery plants.”

The laws, and others like them, are generally supported by Republican lawmakers who claim the companies favor a liberal outlook, while the tech companies insist that they interfere with their ability to combat misinformation and hate speech. A ruling is expected by June…so possibly right in the middle of election season.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino joined CNBC correspondent Julia Boorstin onstage at Vox’s Code Conference this week for what turned into a highly awkward chat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cy5?mblid=3674b1b27b92&mbcid=32881492.2721086&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in which she seemed uninformed of key details about the company she’s been heading since June.

It didn’t help that, in a surprise, former Twitter exec Yoel Roth had sat on the same stage an hour before and harshly criticized Elon Musk. Yaccarino did not hide her agitation at “unexpectedly” having to follow Roth, pointedly noting, “I work at X. He worked at Twitter.” 

Yaccarino said X is on track to become profitable by early 2024 and touted the return of 90% of the largest advertisers that ditched the platform following Musk’s takeover. But she seemed flustered when Boorstin pressed for specifics…

She initially struggled to state the exact daily active user count after being confronted with the fact that downloads and usage are down.

And she deflected a question about Musk’s plans to charge X users a monthly fee, appearing unsure whether it was a final decision.

Despite bristling at the suggestion that she’s CEO in name only since Musk still calls the shots on key product decisions, she asked, “Who wouldn’t want Elon Musk sitting by their side?” It wasn’t meant to get laughs, but it did.—SK

Over the next two years, Starbucks is on pace to open a new store in China every nine hours.

After 25 years of stuffing red envelopes, Netflix will ship out its last DVD <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cuh?mblid=3d2d7b54658d&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> today.

It’s not a surprise: The business is no longer the cash cow it once was, and Netflix wants to cut costs where it can amid the expensive streaming wars. And yet, Netflix wouldn’t be what it is today without the help of DVDs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cui?mblid=a6af5f4f50c4&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The company that now influences decisions at the highest levels of Hollywood was built atop those shiny silver discs.

In the beginning, there was Beetlejuice. The Tim Burton film was the first DVD Netflix sent in 1998, back when most Friday nights were spent going to Blockbuster…only to find all copies of A Bug’s Life were taken. Netflix rendered that blue-and-gold behemoth obsolete by making it easy to rent a DVD online and get it the next day, with no late fees or due dates. At the height of its DVD service, Netflix was the US Postal Service’s fifth-largest customer, processing 1.2 million DVDs weekly, according to the NYT. It generated $2.6 billion in profit between 2012 and 2019, which Netflix used to invest in streaming and make original content gems like The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

Now, it’s just a service that we used to know

While the end of the DVD service was inevitable—the company’s name all but foresaw that—there were still about a million paying customers sad to see it go. And for those loyal renters, Netflix offered a parting gift <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cuj?mblid=cfc364cda27f&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>: They can keep their final discs.

To commemorate the occasion, we’ve compiled some of our all-time favorite DVD picks. We still love you, bouncing DVD logo.

Adam: The Lord of the Rings extended editions. The best behind-the-scenes content of all time. IYKYK.

Abby: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg because it deserves to be viewed on a bigger screen than my laptop.

Sam: The Parent Trap because the more Lindsay Lohans, the merrier.

Cassandra: Monk. It gets nostalgia points for being the first show I watched via Netflix DVD, and it stars my favorite actor, Tony Shalhoub.

Matty: Talladega Nights. I can’t be expected to remember every iconic line at all times.

Dave: The Avengers (1998). Because Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are great together, and no other movie has ever come close when it comes to avenging.

Cohen first bought a stake in GameStop in 2020 and then joined its board the following year at the height of the meme stock frenzy. Its stock has since cooled off, but better-than-expected revenue in the second quarter may suggest Cohen’s plan to push deeper into e-commerce is starting to take effect.

Saltwater is infiltrating the Mississippi River <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cuo?mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New Orleans Mississippi <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cuo?mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Sean Gardner/Getty Images
Saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico is creeping into the Mississippi River, polluting the drinking water in Louisiana parishes and threatening to strike New Orleans. President Biden approved <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cup?mblid=8e30811cdf60&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an emergency declaration for Louisiana this week, unlocking federal funds to deal with the salt onslaught.

Local officials are assuring residents that there will be plenty of bottled water to go around and imploring them to abstain from raiding supermarket aisles.

Why is Big Muddy getting salty?

A wedge-shaped layer of saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico is always present under the Mississippi’s freshwater. The river current normally pushes the saltwater downstream, keeping it near the mouth of the river.

But a lack of rainfall this summer has weakened the river’s usual flow, allowing the brine to move upstream.

Since the Mississippi is running low more frequently with climate change, the risk of repeated saltwater intrusions is only growing.

US Army Corps of Engineers to the rescue. The group is working to delay the saltwater’s encroachment by increasing the height of an existing underwater barrier. It’s also planning to relocate freshwater from further upriver.—SK

If there were ever a morning for a continental breakfast, this would be it. While you were sleeping, American golfers began their Ryder Cup title defense <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ctQ?mblid=787118485a47&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against Europe at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club on the outskirts of Rome. Team USA dominated the 2021 tournament in Wisconsin—however, the US has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.

The beloved golf tournament began in 1927 and is played every two years, alternating between the US and Europe.

How it works: Over three days, the US and European teams will compete against each other in a variety of “match play” formats to earn points. The team with the most points wins, but it’s all for bragging rights—there’s no prize money handed out.

Here’s a primer to get yourself familiar with the intercontinental rivalry.

Key performance indicators <#> Costco gold bars Francis Scialabba
Stat: The perfect Costco haul: 4,000 dishwasher pods, a 700-ounce bottle of Kirkland vodka, and a 24-karat gold bar <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cua?mblid=03df7d395fef&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The bulk seller is now listing the precious metal on its website for members only at about $1,900 a pop. Even with a limit of two bars per member, Costco often sells out a few hours after putting them online. The value of gold has jumped over 15% in the last year, but Costco’s real interest seems to be attracting survivalists who might also buy some supplies for their panic rooms, like this bucket of 150 dried meals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cub?mblid=63c7c29a06fe&mbcid=32866507.2803900&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

GOVERNMENT

What to expect if the government shuts down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqs?mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Congress with lights flickeringinside. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqs?mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
There’s still time for a last-minute deal. But unless Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can break his stalemate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7P?mblid=824a9a7e0228&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with right-wing members of his own party to pass a new spending bill, the federal government will have to pack it up on October 1.

Even if you’re not a park ranger, or someone who relies on food assistance programs like WIC—which would only have a few days of contingency funds to carry on during a shutdown—the government turning off funding will have far-reaching consequences that could impact you.

Here are some of the disruptions to expect…

Travelers: Because most of its employees are considered essential workers, the TSA will keep yelling at you to take your shoes off, and the people directing planes in towers won’t be sent home. But all hiring and training would pause, further delaying the travel industry’s pandemic recovery. Oh, and national parks would probably stay open—but without bathrooms.

Investors: Sorry if you had a big IPO planned next week. The stock market itself wouldn’t be closed, but SEC Chair Gary Gensler said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqt?mblid=a577444c3c5b&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that a shutdown would reduce his department’s staff to about 7%, which could mean companies that haven’t already filed to go public would have to wait.

Government contractors: Most federal employees would receive back pay when the government eventually started up again, but the roughly 3 million to 4 million federal contractors likely won’t recoup the estimated $1.9 billion they stand to lose every day the government is closed, according to the president of the trade association that represents government contract workers. Big companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and pharma giants like Pfizer would probably bounce back quickly, though.

The good (?) news…the IRS will probably be just fine thanks to a funding boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqu?mblid=8dfdeed05e0a&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Inflation Reduction Act, and the postal service will still deliver your bills.

Big picture: Experts warn that the longer a shutdown lasts, the more losses start spreading. During the last shutdown, which went five weeks, the US economy lost $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.—MM

This classic online con is notorious for swindling seniors out of their retirement money, but it turns out Gen Z is more likely than boomers to fall for internet scams, according to a new report from Deloitte.

In a survey of more than 2,000 Americans, Deloitte found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqB?mblid=9291d0a7bfc9&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that despite being the generation born and bred in the bowels of the World Wide Web, Gen Z is…

Three times as likely as boomers (16% vs. 5%) to fall for an online scam.

Twice as likely as boomers (17% vs. 8%) to get hacked on social media.

The reason is simple: Younger people spend an exceptional amount of time communicating and shopping online, Deloitte told Vox <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqC?mblid=e0dd41b5715c&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, which gives them more opportunities to fall victim to a suspicious Instagram account promising massive crypto returns, for example, or a fraudulent e-commerce site posing as a sneaker retailer.

And even when they try to live in the moment, today’s youths can’t help but be chronically online—half of 11- to 17-year-olds in the US get anywhere from 237 to 5,000 cell phone notifications per day <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqD?mblid=c17318627495&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, almost all of which are social media alerts, according to Common Sense Media.

Sleepy Hollow Farm in Pomfret, Vermont, hasn’t been very sleepy lately. The picturesque private residence has become so infested with leaf-peeping tourists that the town of about 900 has been forced to kick them all out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqI?mblid=35dfc9f11e75&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

What happened? Residents say that in recent years, tourists in pursuit of the perfect fall foliage photo have damaged roads, trampled gardens, and even defecated on private property, leaving locals no choice but to close two main roads to nonresidents through Oct. 15. The Instagram-fueled desecration has gotten so bad that it’s “changed the neighborhood landscape to the point that it is untenable,” according to a GoFundMe page <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqJ?mblid=818eee0e1f27&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> set up by the community.

It’s not always as easy as closing a road. In Venice, the main islands now have more tourist beds than residents, and many fear the fabric of the city is on the brink of collapse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cqK?mblid=bec1b1a57b60&mbcid=32854111.2678548&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> because so few locals remain.

Good morning. If you want to understand the secrets of longevity, skip Andrew Huberman and learn from Jeff Probst. Survivor returns for its 45th season tonight. Having aired its first episode all the way back in 2000, the show is older than the Xbox, the iPod, and the Pumpkin Spice Latte. Think about this: Olivia Rodrigo has never known a world without Survivor.

Why Biden and Trump are both talking to auto workers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cn_?mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Biden and Trump UAW <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cn_?mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to join workers on a picket line after he rallied striking members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in Michigan yesterday, telling the picketers that they “deserve a significant raise.”

Taking a different approach, his presidential predecessor and likely 2024 rival, Donald Trump, is Great Lake State-bound today and plans to appear in front of current and retired UAW members...at a nonunion auto supplier.

The dual visit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co0?mblid=af5b71699b9a&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> comes amid an 18,300-person walkout the union is staging at select Ford, GM, and Stellantis facilities. Both the current and former POTUS hope to convince workers to slap their campaign bumper stickers onto their personal cars ahead of the 2024 presidential election, in which Michigan is one of a handful of states that could play a big role in determining the winner.

Union Joe–UAW tensions

Even though UAW President Shawn Fain appeared alongside <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co1?mblid=02c8e6d3046f&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Biden on the picket line, the union has yet to endorse the president for reelection.

One sticking point is the transition to electric vehicles.

Biden backs EVs for the environment, but the UAW worries that EV plants require less labor and pay workers less.

Trump, who is missing tonight’s GOP debate to speak with auto workers instead, has blasted Biden’s EV policies, claiming they’ll “annihilate the US auto industry.” He predicted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co2?mblid=975caaaa47b2&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, “Within 3 years, all of these cars will be made in China.”

But UAW ain’t voting MAGA, yet…union leaders have blasted Trump for what they claim are broken promises to create new automaking jobs during his presidency and for appointing officials who diminished union power. And Fain says he won’t be seeing Trump while he’s in town.

Big picture: Both sides likely need Michigan to win, and the president has been falling out of favor with the union rank-and-file while Trump has gained. Unionized workers, according to an August poll by one Michigan firm, were slightly more likely <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co0?mblid=d6e12369676f&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to support Trump than Biden, despite favoring Biden as recently as June.—SK

Judge rules Trump committed fraud in his real estate business.

It’s a win for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is seeking a $250 million penalty in her civil suit against the ex-president, because it determines before they head to trial that Trump is liable for fraud. Trump had already sued to get the judge thrown off the case, but if that fails, a trial is scheduled to begin next Monday.

JPMorgan settles sex trafficking suit for $75 million. The bank agreed to pay <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co7?mblid=8f6a339c26e7&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> rather than face a trial in the Virgin Islands government’s lawsuit accusing the bank of complicity in the sex trafficking undertaken by former client Jeffrey Epstein (now deceased). JPMorgan also revealed that it had reached a confidential deal with its former exec Jes Staley, resolving the bank’s claims that he should be responsible for any damages in litigation stemming from the association with the convicted sex offender. These come after an agreement for JPMorgan to pay $290 million to Epstein’s victims in a separate suit.

The FCC wants net neutrality…again. The FCC is planning to reinstate net neutrality <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co8?mblid=eec2adb9ae4e&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> rules requiring internet providers to treat all websites the same and not throttle sites that won’t pay for faster speeds. If this feels like deja vu, it’s because the FCC made similar rules in 2015, prompting a legal battle from the broadband industry (which it won), and then revoked them during the Trump administration. Now that Democrats again have a majority in the agency, the FCC expects to vote on its latest proposal in October. Let’s hope we don’t have to watch any FCC commissioners do internet-famous dances <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/co9?mblid=1398b5c55c8e&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this time.

The FTC and 17 states delivered a sweeping lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cob?mblid=8326773323cc&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against Amazon yesterday, accusing the trillion-dollar e-commerce company of acting as an illegal monopoly. It’s the fourth lawsuit levied by the FTC against Amazon this year and easily the one with the most profound consequences for US antitrust legislation (and your ability to procure an inflatable cow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/coc?mblid=62edd1a547d0&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 24 hours).

What’s in the suit? The FTC and state attorneys general allege that Amazon abused its power by punishing sellers if they offered lower prices on other platforms, a practice that led to higher prices for consumers. Sellers on the marketplace were also allegedly coerced to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services or face penalties like reduced visibility. FTC Chair Lina Khan said that Amazon takes $1 for every $2 a seller makes.

What does the FTC want? While the FTC is looking to break up Google and Facebook, it’s unclear if that’s the goal here. It’s asked for a permanent injunction to stop the alleged misconduct. An Amazon spokesperson riposted, claiming prices will increase and delivery speeds will slow if the FTC gets its way.

Google turns 25 today, so while the company prepares for the final year on its parents’ health insurance and starts spiraling about all of its friends getting engaged, let’s explore one of its most iconic features: the Google Doodle.

The Doodle was born <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cn0?mblid=99c221f7556c&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in August 1998, when onlyemployees had access to the site. It wasn’t meant to be a permanent feature: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added a stick figure behind the second “O” in the logo to remind staff they would be OOO at Burning Man. While most CMOs tsk tsk logo changes, Google continued experimenting with new designs and now a team of illustrators and engineers (called doodlers, obvi) have published over 5,000 Doodles.

Stat: Y’all are eating a whole lot of Cup Noodles. The demand for instant noodles <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/coh?mblid=392bc33515d0&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> jumped 2.6% globally to a record high of 121.2 billion servings last year as inflation drove up food prices, according to figures from the World Instant Noodles Association. The just-add-water dinner is most popular in China and other Asian countries, but Big Slurp is gaining ground in NorthAmerica, too. Demand spiked 17.2% in Mexico in 2021 and another 11% last year. In the US, their popularity dipped 1.4% in 2021, but sales rebounded by 3.4% last year. Two major Japanese noodle companies are planning to set up factories in the US by 2025 to meet the growing local appetite.

If you’ve struggled to score a resy at NYC hotspot Mehran’s Steak House, it might have something to do with the fact that, despite boasting more than 90 glowing Google reviews, the restaurant…doesn’t exist <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/coi?mblid=7433b0fbf31e&mbcid=32842191.2684357&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. It’s simply the name a group of tech employees gave their apartment on Google Maps. But once the waiting list for the nonexistent steak house grew to over 900 people, they decided to make it a reality—for one night only. The perplexed but very hip diners who got in from the list at the downtown spot they rented out were divided on the quality of the food made by non-professional volunteers, according to the New York Times, with one comparing it to a wedding buffet and others wondering (correctly) if the whole thing was a joke.

Good morning. The Earth-shattering news over the weekend was that Taylor Swift traveled to Kansas City to cheer on her (rumored) boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Not sure why everyone is surprised to see Swift at a football stadium. She’s played in more football stadiums this year (17) than Kelce will this season (12 max if the Chiefs reach the Super Bowl).

If the Chiefs do reach the Super Bowl, Swift will only be there as a spectator. Usher was selected to headline the halftime show, an opportunity he called the “honor of a lifetime.”

Fantastic news for anyone who was missing The Drew Barrymore Show: The union representing Hollywood writers agreed to a tentative deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cgA?mblid=95c01db563b5&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with major studios, likely ending a strike that has frozen TV and film production for nearly five months.

For the deal to become official, the ~11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) need to ratify it. But that seems like a foregone conclusion after WGA leadership claimed it won major concessions from studios. The union’s negotiating committee called the deal “exceptional” and said it provided “meaningful gains and protections for writers.”

We don’t know the exact terms of the deal, but the details are expected to emerge early this week, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

How we got here

Writers began their strike in May after accusing the studios of embracing a new business model—streaming—that left them unable to earn a middle-class income. Writers also wanted protection from the growing use of artificial intelligence to generate content, which they consider an existential threat to their profession.

Studios responded that they, too, were feeling pinched by seismic changes in the industry, like the decline of their profitable cable TV channels. Disney CEO Bob Iger called the writers’ demands “not realistic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cgB?mblid=c5c2df363f62&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” and said they were “adding to the set of the challenges that this business is already facing.”

But staring down an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in global ticket sales <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cgC?mblid=b5c5a09f29a4&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for movies whose released dates were pushed back due to the strike, the studios agreed to most of what writers wanted, per the NYT.

What happens next?

Late night and daytime talk shows like Barrymore’s could return imminently, but scripted TV won’t restart production because a separate strike by tens of thousands of actors and 100,000+ other Hollywood employees is ongoing. But the good news out of the writers’ camp could spur the actors and studios to return to the negotiating table.

Uber is celebrating the power of planning with an incredible tool: Uber Reserve <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bXb?lp=text1&mbadid=32205cef64d1f39c6091f31c8364f24e&mbadv=a&mblid=15c201409b33&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, an Uber app feature that lets you book your ride up to 90 days in advance.

Jimmy Carter has a busier schedule than we do. The former president and his wife Rosalynn visited <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cg9?mblid=0b0975a7f163&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Plains Peanut Festival in their Georgia hometown (peanuts hold great significance for Carter, who grew up on a peanut farm). It was a dramatic appearance because the ex-president has been in hospice care since February, when his grandson expected him to live about five days longer. Seven months later, Carter is one week away from his 99th birthday. He is the longest-living American president.

New York City issued a travel advisory through Sunday, while city residents who live in basement apartments in at-risk areas were told to prepare to move to higher ground and avoid flooded subway stations. The Weather Prediction Center warned that excessive rainfall over parts of the northern mid-Atlantic and southern New England from yesterday into this morning could create flash flooding.

The next time you’re fuming over your delivery guy running 20 minutes late, consider how happy everyone is at NASA to receive a package <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cg4?mblid=1cede82ac835&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from space after sending away for it seven years ago.

Yesterday morning, scientists retrieved an estimated 8.8 ounces of rocks and soil from the asteroid Bennu, the first time NASA has ever gathered a sample from an asteroid. When the sample capsule landed in the Utah desert after being dropped off by the Osiris-Rex spacecraft from 63,000 miles away, it marked the denouement of a 4-billion-mile journey that began in 2016.

Fun fact: NASA uses this area of Utah for sample return missions because it is the largest restricted airspace in the US, per The Verge.

Why is this a big deal?

The hope is that the asteroid sample will contain key information about the beginning <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cg5?mblid=6603cfded86c&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of our solar system and tell us more about the origins of life on Earth. According to one popular theory, asteroids crashing into Earth billions of years ago contained ingredients fundamental to creating life.

But that theory hasn’t been put to the test...until now. Scientists will analyze the rocks and soil for the next two years and will release some preliminary details about the sample in October.

Looking ahead…Hot Strike Summer is making way for Asteroid Autumn. Along with the sample collected Sunday, NASA has a couple of other asteroid missions reaching milestones this year. Next month, NASA will launch the spacecraft Psyche to track down an asteroid with the same name in what can only be considered an incredible coincidence.

Netflix ends DVD service: Looking out your window and waiting for that red envelope to arrive—also known as the mail gaze—will become a thing of the past <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cgi?mblid=3d693bcb5993&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Friday, when Netflix will ship its final DVDs. While it’s a tough day for people who believe the only way to watch The Wrong Missy is on DVD, it also shows how Netflix’s catalog has dwindled over the years. At its height, Netflix had 100,000 DVD titles from which to choose; as of July, it’s now streaming an estimated 6,600.

Biden will picket with striking auto workers: In a nearly unprecedented move by a sitting president, President Biden will head to Michigan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cf_?mblid=0126411f988f&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Tuesday to support the UAW strike. Biden has billed himself as the most pro-union president in history, but he hasn’t yet secured the endorsement of the powerful UAW, and his path to reelection in 2024 could wind through Michigan. University of Texas at Austin historian Jeremi Suri told Reuters <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cgj?mblid=f03c18d72eff&mbcid=32817441.3125919&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Biden is likely the first president to publicly support striking workers since Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.

Unfortunately, the company went too far with the “at least three days in-person” recording they put in the toys.

The pay: $110/hour. The hours: Every dang day until the job is done.

One of the US locations will be in Pigeon Forge, TN, which means the perfect vacation now exists: smashing your loved ones with foam darts after visiting Dollywood.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Science meme of a velociraptor asking questions Imgflip Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even get rid of garlic breath.

Deep breathing helps AI do math. Okay, not literally. But after Google’s PaLM 2 large language model was prompted to “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step,” the ChatGPT-like bot answered a set of math questions more accurately <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceg?mblid=8f44e99e2411&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> than it did without those mindful instructions, Google DeepMind researchers found. They think it might be because large language models scrape data from the internet, and these calming phrases often appear on Q&A forums that walk people through math problems. Past research has shown that prompting chatbots with humanlike language improves their responses.

🧄 Yogurt could be the new breath mint. The next time you have shrimp scampi, you may have a scientific excuse to get froyo for dessert. After food scientists at Ohio State treated raw garlic with whole milk plain yogurt, they discovered a 99% reduction in the food’s odor-producing compounds—meaning the air was essentially deodorized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceh?mblid=adc8b3fe63df&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. In the process, the team also found that fried garlic is far less pungent than raw garlic. The lead researcher previously identified apples, mint, and lettuce as other effective garlic-fighters, especially when eaten immediately afterward. Next up for yogurt trials: human breath tests.

Scientists found a “holy grail” substitute for palm oil. A sustainable alternative to the preservative found in about half of all cosmetic and food products could help people lead healthier lives while saving trees. Made with byproducts from the flax/linseed industry, PALM-ALT has 80% less saturated fat and 30% fewer calories than palm oil—and it’s 70% better for the environment in terms of carbon emissions, researchers say. Plus, a panel of testers couldn’t tell the difference between products made with the breakthrough alternative <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cei?mblid=97636f3b9fc7&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and those made with regular palm shortening. The palm oil industry accounted for 8% of global deforestation between 1990 and 2008.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Could auto workers make a 32-hour workweek the new normal? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cej?mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Obama saying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cej?mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>@obama via Giphy Auto workers were among the first US employees to get the 40-hour workweek, which has been a legal standard for 83 years. So, you can thank them for making the sunrise-to-sunset grind an atypical work arrangement for most people whose title isn’t “junior investment analyst.”

And now the United Auto Workers (UAW) is pushing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cek?mblid=a1bf836fad2e&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to shorten what we consider normal working hours.

Over 18,300 UAW members employed at GM, Ford, and Stellantis are on strike. They’re demanding a 36% pay bump across a four-year contract and annual cost-of-living wage adjustments, enhanced retirement benefits, and the abolition of a tenure-based tiered pay system. But arguably the most audacious part of the UAW’s “what-do-we-want?” chant is a 32-hour workweek without a pay cut.

While negotiation insiders concede this demand is unlikely to make it into the final contracts, it’s been met with worker enthusiasm and could help push the concept into the mainstream even though there’s no consensus about whether an abbreviated workweek is truly…workable.

Is this a new demand?

The idea of normalizing working less than 40 hours a week may sound like it originated on r/antiwork, but it’s actually over 80 years old. It was first floated in the 1930s when workers were making gains in the movement to work less.

First, they got it down to 40: Ford became the first major US company to institute a two-day weekend and shorten the workday to eight hours in 1926. Then, in 1938, the Fair Standards in Labor Act codified a 44-hour week (later reduced to 40 hours) as the norm for hourly workers, with any time beyond that meriting a time-and-a-half overtime pay rate.

Autoworkers pushed for an even shorter workweek, intensifying their demands as carmakers increasingly relied on machines to assemble vehicles in the 1940s. “Labor originally thought, ‘Yeah, this is our thing. We keep fighting for shorter hours and higher wages, and it kind of doesn’t end,’” Jonathan Cutler, a Wesleyan University sociologist who wrote a book on the topic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cel?mblid=f32038551fe0&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, told Morning Brew.

But UAW leadership at the time ultimately chose to prioritize a peaceful relationship with the automakers over pursuing a shorter workweek, according to Cutler, who also said the issue was shelved until the emergence of the current generation of UAW leaders, who are more accountable to the desires of the rank-and-file members.

Does the 32-hour workweek make sense?

Companies in other industries that have recently tried the arrangement have been happy with the results.

* A few dozen UK businesses trialed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cem?mblid=d094c15ae92b&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a shortened workweek for the last six months of 2022 in an experiment organized by the advocacy group 4 Day Week Global <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cen?mblid=e48d792c40f1&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Many participating firms chose to continue testing fewer hours after the trial was over, and employees were overwhelmingly enthusiastic—15% said they would never go back to the five-day grind, no matter how much they’re paid.

* A similar pilot program in Iceland resulted in 90% of workers transitioning to reduced hours or getting other accommodations, per Euronews.

The co-founder of 4 Day Week Global, Andrew Barnes, said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceo?mblid=9dbd0d65384d&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, “The four-day week is a proven strategy to increase productivity and profitability, and to work in a sustainable fashion.”

Not everyone’s convinced: Organizational behavior researcher Alexander Stajkovic noted that the UK study wasn’t peer-reviewed, and participating companies shortened the workweek by only 7% on average. And University of Texas Austin labor economist Daniel Hamermesh told Morning Brew he’s skeptical of positive results from pilot programs since they’re typically run by advocacy groups using white-collar employees and only include employers that were already inclined to try a shorter week. Both experts are doubtful that most workers can maintain the same output with fewer hours.

The fact that the 32-hour workweek remains rare proves that “most workers and most employers just don’t find it feasible or productive,” Hamermesh said.

Bottom line: Whether or not the current movement works out for auto workers, this likely won’t be the last big push for a shorter week, because workers love working less—a third of employees would ditch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cep?mblid=90209f0a88b9&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their current employer for a four-days-a-week opportunity, according to a Monster.com survey.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: What happens in Vegas steaks in Vegas <#> Fontainebleau Las Vegas Ethan Miller/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

If you’re looking for a reason to visit Las Vegas that doesn’t require lying to a significant other about why you really want to go, we have one that takes dining to new heights.

The Fontainebleau Las Vegas, a $3.7 billion hotel nearly two decades in the making, announced it will open on the Strip on Dec. 13. Resort CEO Jeff Soffer broke ground on the hotel in 2007 but, due to the financial crisis, construction stopped the following year and the building remained dormant until 2021. The property changed hands several times over the years before Soffer reacquired it with new investors and finished what he started.

At 67 stories, the Fontainebleau Las Vegas is Nevada’s tallest occupiable building—hopefully it doesn’t cast a shadow over Terry Benedict’s pool—and will be vertically integrated with the casino separated from restaurants and other amenities.

Of the resort’s 36 restaurants, there’s one that’s a cut (of beef) above the rest. The hotel, a sister property of the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, will feature the South Beach staple Papi Steak, allowing its patrons to partake in the renowned Beef Case.

* When you order the $1,000 Wagyu tomahawk steak off the menu, it will be brought to you in a rhinestone-encrusted Beef Case that’s an homage to the briefcase from Pulp Fiction.

* You will be introduced to your raw steak with a presentation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceC?mblid=15218724520c&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that includes strobe lights, an entrance song, and a branding of the steak. Would this be considered a meat-cute?

Since everyone knows a hotel room in Vegas is only there to provide a few hours of sleep before you head back out to do the fun stuff, here’s some of the fun stuff you could be doing before and after Fontainebleau opens:

* Formula 1 racing comes to town Nov. 16–18. If you can’t get tickets, here are the hotels <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceD?mblid=92197ad4944b&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that are expected to have the best views of the race.

* The Sphere at the Venetian—aka the building with the power to transform into a beautiful basketball <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceE?mblid=bf515ceb5c23&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> or haunting eyeball <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceF?mblid=29c19e7633bc&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>—will open this Friday with the first of 25 performances by U2.

* Super Bowl LVIII (that’s 58, for everyone who doesn’t think about ancient Rome all the time) will take place at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11.

Even with the new hotel, Dubai is set to surpass Las Vegas <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ceG?mblid=ba25cf44bb3a&mbcid=32802970.2859941&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as the city with the most hotel rooms by the end of this year, despite not having a single restaurant that serves a Beef Case.—DL

Here are our favorite responses:

* “I’d have a piece of paper reading, “What’s better: Sheetz or Wawa?” sitting underneath a big box propped open with a stick. Once he goes to give his opinion (and trust me, every Pennsylvanian has one), I’d pull the string I have attached to the stick and trap him in the box.”—Clayton from Apex, NC

* “I would find out what the fugitive likes to eat and put a large but undetectable amount of metal into it, leaving it in an area where he could be hiding. After said fugitive eats the meal, I get one of those strong ACME magnets attached to a helicopter, snag the bad guy, and fly him back to the prison.”—Dave from Kalamazoo, MI

* “Rakes in the yard…gets ’em every time.”—Angelica from San Diego, CA

* “I would play Billy Ray Cyrus’s ‘Achy Breaky Heart’ over and over, on the loudest volume possible, until he stands up, holding his ears, screaming.”—Roger

This week’s question

What’s the most underrated kitchen appliance?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I can’t imagine going back to heating water in an old tea kettle on the stove. Absolutely not interested in living in a Laura Ingalls Wilder novel. I need an electric kettle to make sure my Americano is exactly 194 degrees.”

GOVERNMENT

POV: You’re an impending government shutdown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7P?mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> House Speaker Kevin McCarthy addresses the press. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7P?mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Drew Angerer/Getty Images
The deadline to avoid a government shutdown is fast approaching, and the House is tripping over its two right feet.

Moderate and ultra-conservative House republicans are in disagreement, and if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can’t get a new spending bill passed by October 1, the government’s fiscal New Year’s, the money tap will be shut off <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7Q?mblid=3fde0728fcb4&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for most federal agencies.

In addition to furloughing hundreds of thousands of government workers, a potential shutdown means…

FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund could dry up, food stamp payments could be delayed, national parks could close, and clinical trials for new medications could go on pause.

There could be significant travel disruptions because air traffic controllers and the TSA are among the essential workers expected to clock in without pay…so they may stop showing up and start polishing their resumes.

Depending on how long the potential shutdown lasts, a pause on federal workers’ paychecks could reduce the nation’s strong consumer spending and cost the US economy $6 billion per week, EY estimates. The most recent shutdown in 2018 lasted for a record 34 days and analysts say a shutdown now could also drag on for weeks.

Why can’t the House GOP agree?

Though McCarthy and President Joe Biden agreed earlier this year on a $1.6 trillion budget cap, some far-right Republican holdouts want it lowered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7R?mblid=2aeb4eac2b43&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to $1.4 trillion.

Members of the House Freedom Caucus—the group of hardline Republican holdouts including Rep. Matt Gaetz, who recently threatened to try to oust McCarthy—said they would not support any budget that includes additional aid to Ukraine. That’s one reason why some lawmakers think a government shutdown is inevitable.

But…next week, moderate Republicans may rally around <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7S?mblid=0ca75b5ece91&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a new short-term funding plan that could get enough bipartisan support to avoid a shutdown, sources told the Washington Post.—ML

Klaviyo had a big opening day.

This performance likely clears the way for other tech companies to feel confident enough to go public. But, for those keeping score of the IPO market at home, this week’s other high-profile, venture-backed market entrant, Instacart, fell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7X?mblid=62208953a122&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday after an initial bump following its Tuesday debut.

Merrick Garland says he’s “not the president’s lawyer.” Facing a grilling from Republican lawmakers over how the criminal case against the president’s son, Hunter Biden, was handled, the attorney general pushed back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7Y?mblid=df7ca9a384f7&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against accusations of bias, saying he is also “not Congress’s prosecutor.” The combative sparring at a routine Congressional oversight hearing likely previewed some House Republicans’ priorities as they pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

Free covid tests are coming back. Sweater season is expected to bring a rise in Covid cases with it, so the government will be restarting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7Z?mblid=c463b802f391&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a program that offers free at-home Covid tests. Starting Monday, you’ll be able to order up to four tests at COVIDtests.gov and have them delivered through the mail. The Biden administration also said yesterday it’ll give $600 million to manufacturers that make new tests to get in front of the anticipated increase in demand.

Did your kid put a charge on your credit card so they could wear a virtual banana suit in a video game? Time to let it go. As of Tuesday, Fortnite players—and their parents—can apply for a refund <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c7_?mblid=dab4a9cd43cf&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for unintended in-game purchases.

The $245 million in refunds are part of a settlement reached earlier this year between the Federal Trade Commission and Fortnite-maker Epic Games over deceptive billing practices. The FTC alleges that Fortnite players were duped into spending real money <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c80?mblid=9ca1e0ad92b6&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the game through “dark patterns”—or interface designs that get users to buy stuff they may not intend to.

You were wrongfully charged by Fortnite or your account was locked after you told your credit card company that you were wrongfully charged by Fortnite (tough look) between January 2017 and September 2022.

Hide your kids: The FTC also slapped Epic with a $275 million fine—the largest penalty ever issued for violating one of the agency’s rules—for collecting data on users under the age of 13 without their parents’ consent.

Starbucks wants to speed things up a bit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c86?mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Starbucks coffee cup with speed lines like it’s moving forward really fast next to a menu with “2.0x speed” selected to insinuate the cup is going double sped. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c86?mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The cringe memes your dad keeps sending about 98-step coffee orders is kinda right. Starbucks has 383 billion unique latte combinations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c87?mblid=9bec381a87ac&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and is investing in changes to help baristas make all of them a lot faster, according to Bloomberg.

Why the need for speed? The coffee chain is struggling to keep customer wait times down. Continuing a pandemic trend, more people are swarming its mobile app to order their morning bev making it easier to add extra pumps of…everything. And Starbucks can’t just do away with customizations: Extra charges bring in over $1 billion in revenue every year, according to the president of Starbucks North America.

And Starbucks is spending billions in an effort to shave seconds off your wait time:

The chain introduced smaller ice cubes for easier scoopability and is rolling out portable cold foamers so baristas don’t have to clog up prep space at the big blenders.

It also filed a patent earlier this year for a machine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c88?mblid=3008111adc20&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that could automate drink-making.

The company claims the changes will make baristas’ jobs easier, but some workers aren’t so sure. Understaffing is still one of the main issues driving the unionization effort among Starbucks locations—not a lack of souped-up Keurigs.

Big picture: Other chains are also vying for speedier order handling to accommodate larger menus and more sales volume. Popeyes is overhauling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c89?mblid=0039194c2849&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its kitchens for the first time in a decade to make faster chicken sandwiches.—MM

Key performance indicators <#> Bob Ross painting The Joy of Painting/Netflix via Giphy
Stat: How much would you pay for happy little trees? “A Walk in the Woods,” the first painting Bob Ross ever painted on his TV show, The Joy of Painting, is expected to sell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c8d?mblid=7e1c1d29b957&mbcid=32780081.2748451&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for $9.85 million at auction. The program debuted in 1983 and ran for 11 seasons on PBS, with Ross painting 1,000 canvases on-air. Since Ross’s soothing instructions became a pandemic comfort watch, the hirsute painter has become the most searched for artist on Google, leapfrogging Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso, according to the owner of the gallery hosting the auction.

Though Adidas reiterated that ending the partnership was appropriate in the wake of the CEO’s remarks, the company has been successfully selling off the leftover Yeezy gear while donating some of the profits to groups fighting antisemitism. Gulden jumped to Adidas from rival Puma after the company had already severed ties with Ye.

Ahoy, mateys! Today is International Talk Like a Pirate Day, so here’s a cheat sheet for all you landlubbers hoping to appear seaworthy at work today:

Substitute “me” for “I” (i.e., “Methinks this deck is ready for the client”).

Leverage the The Five As: ahoy, avast, arrrrghh, aye, and, when addressing a figure of authority, aye-aye.

Confidence, confidence, confidence! Being a pirate is all about believing in yourself, even if your mutiny fails and results in you getting cleaved to the brisket (don’t look that up).

Instacart’s IPO could be the start of something new <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c1U?mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Instacart banner on the New York Stock Exchange <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c1U?mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Today, Instacart, the grocery delivery app that brings you ice cream and Goldfish when you’re hungover sick, goes public on the Nasdaq. The company priced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c1V?mblid=884e1fccab85&mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its shares at $30, giving it a $10 billion valuation.

Whether Instacart pops or flops, it’s going to be a bellwether for other startups deciding whether to ring the bell based on Wall Street’s appetite <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c1W?mblid=6a47a5d6286a&mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. If Instacart delivers, a new wave of IPOs could be coming after a lull the past year and a half.

Chip design company Arm, which debuted last week in the year’s biggest IPO <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c1X?mblid=84272132c5e0&mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, was the first venture-capital-backed startup to go public in the US since December 2021. It may have broken the ice, but Instacart is the next big test.

Klaviyo, a marketing and automation startup, will set its pricing tonight and open for trading tomorrow in another closely watched IPO.

But IPOs aren’t coming back the same From 2020 to 2021, when IPO money was hot and VC money was cheap, tech company IPOs were mostly growth-focused unicorns that had yet to turn a profit. But Instacart, which has turned a profit for the last five quarters, is something different.

However, being profitable and being valuable aren’t the same thing. In 2020, investors valued Instacart at $39 billion, its highest valuation and roughly $29 billion more than what it is expected to debut at today.

Late-stage investors in Instacart, such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, stand to lose 40% or more.

Sequoia Capital—Instacart’s largest external shareholder—was also one of its earliest. Its initial $8 million investment in 2013 is worth $1 billion today, while its later investment of $50 million in 2021 has shrunk to $12 million.

Zoom out: Instacart’s not the only company to see its value slashed as the economic climate changes. VCs and private funds are realizing that many startups were overvalued when they raised capital, and as some of those companies go public, they’re going to lose money on their initial investments.—CC

The US asserts that the money can only be used for humanitarian purposes, but some Iranian officials have said there are no restrictions on how it can be spent. Though the exchange did not address Iran’s nuclear program directly, it raises the possibility that there could be further dialogue about that as well.

Meanwhile, Musk recently threatened to sue an antisemitism watchdog, the Anti-Defamation League, while blaming X’s slumping ad revenues on criticism from the org. Researchers say antisemitic speech on X doubled in the months after Musk bought the platform.

Reputation control

Netanyahu assured the Silicon Valley audience that “Israel will be always a democratic country” and touted his own role in fostering its tech economy at a time when many investors are spooked by the current political climate.

And meeting with the Israeli PM gave Musk a chance to reiterate that he’s an anti-antisemite. He claimed that it’s not in X’s interest to promote hate speech, arguing that charging users—even “just a few dollars”—is the best way to weed out hateful content.

Key performance indicators <#> A sign that says total days without work 4.1 million Francis Scialabba
Stat: Hot Strike Summer lived up to its name. Strikes and lockouts accounted for 4.1 million missed days of work last month—the highest monthly total since August 2000, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/c2h?mblid=92a7d653fc66&mbcid=32753348.2765335&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of Labor Department data. The dual strikes by Hollywood writers and actors, which are still going on, played a big part in that labor unrest. And that’s before the UAW strike against the Big Three automakers this month, so we might need a new moniker for fall strikes…we humbly suggest Pumpkin Spice Strike Season.

Good morning. The hot trend on social media is for women to ask men how often they think about the Roman Empire. The answer, at least from our perspective, is pretty much…never. Better question: Ask us how often we think about cooking a chili (twice every day, three times on Sundays).

While everyone is focused on who will blink first in the labor standoff between Detroit’s car manufacturers and its unionized workers, one person is already being declared a winner—Elon Musk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-j?mblid=b3be893be027&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Tesla’s CEO was already enjoying a major cost advantage over his competitors thanks to more streamlined production processes and lower wages for his nonunionized workforce. Now that UAW employees are on strike and likely to see increased wages no matter how this labor dispute ends, Tesla’s edge in that area will only grow.

Tesla’s labor costs average $45 an hour, compared to GM, Stellantis, and Ford’s estimated $66 an hour, per the WSJ.

And if the UAW gets the dramatic pay bumps it initially sought, labor costs for Detroit’s Big Three would swell to $136 an hour, according to Wells Fargo.

This year, Tesla has used that cost advantage to slash its car prices in a bid to maintain its commanding market share in electric vehicles. So far, that strategy has paid off: Despite the price cuts, Tesla’s Q2 profits rose 20%.

UAW President Shawn Fain has brushed off <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-k?mblid=aa0efad0000f&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> comments that his labor action would only solidify Tesla’s dominance in the EV market. “Our concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world,” he told CNBC last week.

So, what could slow Tesla’s roll? It’s possible that the UAW strike, if successful at securing higher wages, could galvanize Tesla workers to unionize at Musk’s factories. But the UAW tried and failed to do this in 2017 and 2018.

In other auto strike news…

Fain rejects Stellantis offer: As the union and automakers returned to the negotiating table, the UAW president said Stellantis’s offer of a 21% pay bump was “definitely a no-go <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-l?mblid=f5e9791e6ce2&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.”

John Fetterman joins the march. The senator drove from Pennsylvania to Michigan to march in solidarity with workers this weekend, following the lead of Bernie Sanders, who spoke at a UAW rally on Friday. “It’s time to decide what side you’re on,” Fetterman wrote <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-n?mblid=a0044ac72195&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Russell Brand accused of rape, sexual assault.

Another claimed that Brand assaulted her when she was 16. Brand has denied the allegations, calling his relationships “always consensual.” The accusations surfaced as part of a joint investigation by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches that began in 2019 and included hundreds of sources. The BBC, which employed Brand in the past, said it is “urgently looking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-s?mblid=a2af0d7491ac&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into the issues.”

In the past year, California has dealt with record heat, wildfires, unusual bouts of severe rain and snow, and rising sea levels that have threatened the state’s shorelines—extreme weather events that studies show were made more likely or more intense due to climate change. The suit seeks funding for recovery efforts related to California’s weather-related disasters.

The Biden administration is responsible for the US’ most aggressive climate law (the Inflation Reduction Act) and is working to transition the country to renewable energy, but climate advocates believe he could be doing more. This protest and similar ones around the world this weekend come as the Earth just experienced its hottest summer on record.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE

Illinois becomes the first state to abolish cash bail <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-u?mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Bail bonds sign <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-u?mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Getty Images
The practice of cash bail in the United States dates back to before the country won its independence from England. Over two centuries later, Illinois will become the first state to abolish it.

The state’s Pretrial Fairness Act, which goes into effect today <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-v?mblid=7c3a591ed419&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, will replace a cash bond with a hearing before a judge to determine if a person requires pretrial detention because they pose a flight risk or threaten public safety. Proponents say the change will result in fewer nonviolent offenders who cannot afford cash bail being detained while awaiting trial and fix a system that disproportionately harms Black people and other minority populations.

According to the advocacy group Prison Policy Initiative, there are 427,000 people <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b-w?mblid=390a6a9368de&mbcid=32740889.3154146&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in local jails awaiting trial, and 8 of 10 people in those jails have not been convicted of a crime.

Critics of abolishing cash bail argue it’ll lead to increased crime rates and serve as a pretext for advocates to eliminate incarceration altogether, the FT reported.

But a study by the University of Albany found that bail reform in New York, which last year enacted a law that allowed most people charged with a crime to be released without bail, had a “negligible” impact on crime rates (that NY law has since been rolled back somewhat).

Big picture: While cash bail is rare in other countries, it’s big business in the US. Reuters reported in 2021 that the for-profit bail industry brought insurers $15 billion in revenue a year.

The next night, Colorado continued its dream season with a come-from-behind 43–35 double OT win against Colorado State in the Rocky Mountain Showdown.

Each year on 9/11, from dusk until dawn, the Tribute of Light in Lower Manhattan projects twin beams four miles into the sky.

New moms more likely to see Elvis on toast. That phenomenon of seeing a smile in an inanimate object is called face pareidolia, and researchers have found that it is more common among women who just gave birth. When shown images of random objects, postpartum women tended to identify illusionary faces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYk?mblid=cc22f09fc9b3&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that went unseen by other women. Researchers think this is because new mothers have higher levels of oxytocin, the “love” and “trust” hormone involved in social bonding, which previous studies have connected to the brain’s ability to recognize facial expressions.

‍ Having indigestion? Try turmeric. In the first clinical trial to directly compare turmeric to conventional indigestion drugs, the yellow spice proved its medicinal worth <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYl?mblid=4d42bdbc742b&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Hospital patients in Thailand who received turmeric capsules recovered just as well from their stomach pain as those placed on omeprazole, a generic form of Prilosec OTC (which is linked to health risks with long-term use). Turmeric has long been used in Eastern medicine as a natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial treatment, and these findings could justify clinical use, the researchers said.

The science of saltwater taffy. The hungriest brains in physics have answered the greatest theoretical question facing beach towns: What makes saltwater taffy so soft and chewy? The sugary treat—described by one researcher as being “between a viscous liquid and an elastic solid”—is stretchy and long-lasting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYm?mblid=51deee0601bc&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> because of the air bubbles and oil droplets that form when the candy is pulled. The study found that aerating and adding emulsifiers like lecithin resulted in smaller oil droplets and even chewier taffy, a finding that could also apply to similar foods like cheese, bread dough, and chewing gum.—ML

* A trio of high-profile Shariah scholars from Saudi Arabia said this week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYq?mblid=446bed57880d&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that chicken produced by California-based Good Meat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYr?mblid=49ba6c2bd7fb&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (one of the first lab-grown meats to win FDA approval) could be made in a halal-compliant way.

Getting the nod from religious authorities could help petri-dish-grown protein become a staple in the diet of millions of believers worldwide. But the path to acceptance isn’t guaranteed, since theological opinions on food vary even with dishes that aren’t on the technological bleeding edge.

What’s at stake with lab-made steak?

Lab-grown meat producers claim that they’re on a capital-“M” mission: Fighting climate change by satiating carnivorous consumers’ appetites more ethically and sustainably.

Convincing observant communities that lab-grown meat is compatible with their faith is not just a matter of social progress—it’s also a business opportunity. Estimates of annual sales of halal food globally range from $775 billion to a whopping $2.2 trillion, while kosher food is a $41 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYs?mblid=9cb290362601&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> market.

Good Meat CEO Josh Tetrick told Morning Brew the company reached out to Shariah scholars because “2 billion Muslims around the world won’t eat meat unless it’s halal.” Growing meat artificially is a capital-intensive process that requires massive bioreactors, and the company wants Muslim-majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the infrastructure, Tetrick said.

Getting the kosher- and halal-certified stickers

For lab-grown meat companies to compete with halal and kosher butchers, they must harvest animal cells to create their products in a way that adheres to religious rules.

Processes that involve harvesting cells from a live animal are a problem for many observant Jews and Muslims, as rabbinical and Shariah rules forbid eating meat obtained from living animals. So, in order for the meat to be compliant, the cells have to come from an animal that was slaughtered in accordance with halal and kosher rules.

There are also potential workarounds: With poultry, there’s the “option of taking the stem cells from an egg without touching the bird at all,” Orthodox Kosher Union CEO Rabbi Menachem Genack told Morning Brew. That’s the method used by SuperMeat, which got the kosher seal of approval from his organization.

After the cells are obtained, the subsequent meat culturing process requires placing the cells into a steel vat filled with a “nutrient-rich broth,” according to Scientific American, which would also need to fall in line with religious rules. The reagents and equipment used to turn the cell mass into a chunk of meat must be halal, head of the Cornell Kosher and Halal Food Initiative Joe Regenstein told Morning Brew. Similarly, they’d have to adhere to Jewish law for the resulting meat to be considered kosher, according to Rabbi Genack.

Differing opinions

Just as they do with regular meat, different branches of the same religion might not agree on what constitutes proper lab-grown meat cultivation, Regenstein noted.

For example, Sunni Muslims in places like Saudi Arabia and Iran-based Shiite Muslims may have different standards for what they view as a truly halal slaughtering process.

Not all strictly observant Hasidic Jews will automatically accept the Orthodox Kosher Union’s determination that a lab-grown meat product is kosher. They instead require their own representatives to evaluate.

Lab-grown meat companies could court Hindus, too…many Hindus and Jainists in India practice vegetarianism, as it’s consistent with the principle of nonviolence toward all living beings. If they come to view meat that didn’t come directly from a slaughtered animal as palatable, it could boost the products’ appeal in the world’s most populous country.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Mongolia <#> Place to be: Mongolia It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Millennials have been accused of ruining everything from Buffalo Wild Wings to the napkin industry, but they also could be the driving force behind the surging popularity <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYD?mblid=59e087a04bb1&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of tourism to Mongolia, the NYT reported.

The central Asian country, known for its very cold winters and short summers, has recorded a nearly 73% increase in foreign travelers this year compared to last year. A good chunk of that could be due to Mongolia capitalizing on millennials’ desire to visit destinations that haven’t already been thoroughly exhausted on social media (and Mongolia, situated between China and Russia, checks that box). The Mongolian government has invested in a digital marketing campaign targeting people ages 23 to 40 and invited influencers to visit the country and post videos of its beautiful landscapes.

* A trip by noted travel tastemaker Pope Francis to Mongolia two weeks ago <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYE?mblid=cd12d39c560a&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> was probably unrelated to that campaign—but we can’t really know for sure.

So…what is there to do in Mongolia?

Plenty. It boasts music festivals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYF?mblid=a787511ca3f6&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> akin to Coachella (AI can envision the Pope DJing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYG?mblid=3ba8baf48672&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at one of them), mounted archery, and a dinosaur festival <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYH?mblid=cc2470eeb6b1&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Despite mounting evidence showing Mongolia’s tourism marketing is working, it’s also possible that all of these visitors are feeling drawn to their ancestral home, since 1 in 200 men are allegedly descended from Genghis Khan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bYJ?mblid=49e37bd5c68a&mbcid=32725674.3108187&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.—DL

  COMMUNITY

  Crowd work <#> Last week, we asked: What’s the best non-coat outer layer for fall: hoodie, crew neck, unbuttoned flannel, cardigan, sweater, vest, or quarter-zip?

Here are our favorite responses:

* “The Cowichan Cardigan Sweater is the most awesome sweater ever knitted. It comes from a very specific region on Vancouver Island. They retail for about $500, but if you’re patient, you can find one at a consignment or thrift store for about $50.”—Mark from Los Angeles, CA

* “I will forever be a hoodie person. Not only is it great for temperature regulation, but if you want to tap out of a conversation, just tie off the hood strings and vibe in your own world.”—Tom from Pittsburgh, PA

* “A love letter to the quarter zip: It merges the best properties of a crew neck (the absence of hood and strings) with the best of the hoodie (comfort, pocket).”—Lauren

* “I intentionally planned this baby so I’d be pregnant during sweater weather. I live for chunky cable knits.”—Alyx from Helena, MT

* “You forgot about the timeless combo-answer: sweater vest.”—Winslow from Raleigh, NC

* “The cardigan is a uniquely versatile beast. It has been worn by the likes of Mr. Rogers, Kurt Cobain, Steve McQueen, and Taylor Swift. There is even a band named The Cardigans with the hit song ‘Lovefool.’ It can be dressed up or down and has the added benefit of not having to be brought overhead, so it doesn’t interfere with one’s hair.”—Isaac from Houston, TX

This week’s question

The escaped Pennsylvania murderer Danelo Cavalcante was apprehended this week with the help of a police dog. Yawn. What Looney Tunes-esque trap would you deploy to capture a fugitive?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “Everyone loves dessert. So I would put a cooling pie on a windowsill with a fan pushing the smell into the forest he’s hiding in. Then when he approaches the pie, he falls through the brush that’s covering a big hole I dug underneath the windowsill. There’s of course a trampoline at the bottom of the hole and the fugitive bounces out of the hole and directly into my arms above.”

Your thirst for topical punchlines and reusable desk bits is about to be quenched…well, if talk show hosts can come up with them off the tops of their heads. The Drew Barrymore Show, Real Time with Bill Maher, The Jennifer Hudson Show, and The Talk announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZC?mblid=4462274aa5b2&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this week that they will return to the air despite the ongoing writers and actors strikes—but there’ll be no writers.

They aren’t technically breaking any rules.

Under the terms of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), talk show hosts like Barrymore, Hudson, and Maher are contracted under an agreement known as the Netcode, which is not under negotiation like the deal for actors is. That’s how shows like The View are able to do, erm, whatever they’re doing right now even with the SAG strike going on.

But because of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, the hosts just have to kind of riff without a script. During the last writers strike in 2007, Ellen Degeneres caught flak for performing monologue-style introductions she claimed were improvised.

There’s been a cacophony of pushback, especially for Barrymore. Her show’s striking co-head writer spoke out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZD?mblid=5aeccd96856a&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, WGA picketers gathered outside Barrymore’s studio, and the National Book Awards rescinded their invite for her to host its November ceremony.

So, why are they doing it?

In a video posted on her Instagram yesterday, Barrymore defended her decision, saying, “There are other people’s jobs on the line.” Maher shared a similar sentiment on X (formerly Twitter), saying that he didn’t want to “see so many below-the-line people suffer.”

Late night hosts who returned to their desks without writers during the 2008 strike, including Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Conan O’Brien, gave similar reasons <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZE?mblid=464c6db0e6c7&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

But there are other ways to support crews. Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, and John Oliver created the Strike Force Five podcast, promising to donate proceeds to staff and crew who aren’t working. Plus, The Union Solidarity Coalition is funding crew healthcare by auctioning off Zoom calls with celebs and Lena Dunham murals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZF?mblid=cbd75e978a76&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Looking ahead…more talk shows may come back soon, and the WGA and major studios are set to meet for negotiations next week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZG?mblid=e19517502f69&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the first time since mid-August.—MM

Hurricane Lee approaches New England and Canada. Like the shark in Jaws that doesn’t appear for the first hour of the movie, Hurricane Lee has been hanging out in the Atlantic Ocean but is finally ready to strike <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZK?mblid=2f795cbaf6ac&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The storm is expected to make landfall today in New Brunswick, Canada with the strength of a powerful tropical storm. But because it’s such a large hurricane, with topical-storm level winds stretching as far as 300 miles from its center, Lee’s impact will likely be felt in New England and along the East Coast.

Exactly how to implement it is still being debated, as major diamond hubs like Belgium want to ensure they’re not just kicking business to Dubai.

The United Auto Workers strike that began yesterday is historic not just because it’s the first one ever called against the Big Three automakers simultaneously but also because the union is adopting a new strategy that brings signaling-left-but-turning-right energy to the labor fight.

About 146,000 UAW members are employed at Ford, GM, and Stellantis, but rather than all striking from the jump, workers will walk out in waves at specific locations as negotiations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bWa?mblid=1e267272303f&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> persist. So far, nearly 13,000 Ford, GM, and Stellantis factory workers have walked off the job at three plants that produce 9% of the companies’ vehicles in North America.

This unusual strategy will “keep the companies guessing,” maximizing the union’s leverage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZP?mblid=8c9014048faa&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, UAW President Shawn Fain said.

Having fewer workers strike will also stretch the UAW’s $825 million strike fund, which gets disbursed to picketing members, so the union can afford to bargain for longer. It could be a long haul <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZQ?mblid=00758393da89&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>: The automakers’ leaders—including GM CEO Mary Barra, who got flamed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZR?mblid=5ed5140923ac&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday for defending her $29 million salary—claim that meeting the union’s pay demands would bankrupt them.

A psychedelic drug familiar to Tomorrowland attendees could be an effective treatment for PTSD, according to research published in Nature Medicine this week.

MDMA, aka “ecstasy,” or “molly,” combined with therapy, was shown <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZW?mblid=8a4b6a1cdc43&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to produce a “clinically meaningful” improvement for almost 90% of treated patients with moderate and severe PTSD.

The encouraging results put the illicit substance on a path to becoming a prescription drug if US regulators approve it for widespread clinical use.

How does MDMA do it? One researcher involved in the study dubbed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bZX?mblid=4a24246e3b3c&mbcid=32730165.2730303&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> MDMA “a communication lubricant” that makes it easier for patients to open up about their trauma. That could explain why 71% of participants taking MDMA ended up PTSD-free, compared to 48% of the placebo group (that also got therapy).

The prominent activist group behind the research effort, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, plans to apply for FDA approval for MDMA by the end of the year, and it’s already talking with health insurers about covering the drug.

The deal still needs league approval, but if it goes through, 10 of the 20 top-flight clubs will be American-owned, according to the BBC.

Pour one out: Surge pricing hits beer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSe?mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jerry Seinfeld looking at an expensive check <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSe?mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee/Sony Pictures Television via Giphy
It’s a sign that nothing is sacred in times of high inflation: Britain’s largest pub company, Stonegate Group, recently announced the adoption of surge pricing at 800 of its locations across the UK <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSf?mblid=9c12e65065f8&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Those pubs put up signs with a “Polite Notice” warning drinkers about increased costs during peak times, the Telegraph reported this week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSg?mblid=912b4cf27e08&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The company said that the price increases—up to an additional 20 pence for a pint of beer—are meant to offset higher costs for staffing and licensing requirements. The decision to adopt dynamic pricing comes after Stonegate reported a $28.7 million loss the first half of the year due to Britain’s cost-of-living crisis.

Even though beer prices at Stonegate locations go down after peak hours, should you crave a Heineken at 11am, the backlash was fast and fierce. Consumer advocacy group Campaign for Real Ale called the policy an “unhappy hour surge” and said it could deter bewhiskered customers who rely on the pub as an affordable place to hang out. Other pub owners capitalized on Stonegate’s bad PR by announcing they’re keeping prices the same.

It’s not just pubs Airlines and hotels have used surge pricing for years, but when the revenue strategy expands to other industries, it doesn’t always work so well:

AMC said in July it would abandon an effort to implement higher prices for more popular seats after it tested out the surge model and found it had no effect on revenue and really annoyed people who were just trying to see a movie.

Lyft is working to remove its surge pricing feature due to the fact that it can dampen demand and “riders hate it with a fiery passion,” according to CEO David Risher.

One of the many reasons for outrage at Ticketmaster is its dynamic pricing, which sold coveted Bruce Springsteen tickets for as much as $4,000.

Big picture: Even though they know consumers despise it, companies with access to algorithms and a desire to maximize revenue are probably going to keep finding new parts of life <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSh?mblid=fa61d26918ce&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to add surge pricing to.—CC

At the end of the sprawling manhunt, authorities pinpointed Cavalcante’s whereabouts with a heat-sensing plane, and a police dog subdued him for arrest. During his time on the run, Cavalcante, who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend, changed his appearance, stole a van, and broke into homes to steal food and even a rifle.

The targeted strikes are a strategy to disrupt car production while allowing many of the union’s 150,000 members to continue to get paid but could also be expanded to a full work stoppage that could have a major impact on the economy if negotiations remain stalled. The two sides remain far apart, with wages as the major sticking point.

The Danish Navy said its closest vessel can’t arrive to rescue them until Friday, and efforts by a fishing boat to unstick the cruise ship failed yesterday. Members of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol unit, which operates in the Arctic wilderness, have been to the ship, and will be on hand to aid in the rescue. The situation highlights concerns as more ships venture to the remote area that dangerous and costly rescues may become more common.

Aaron Rodgers’s torn Achilles tendon is becoming an Achilles’ heel for the NFL. Following the star quarterback’s season-ending injury in his debut for the New York Jets this week, the players union is again urging the league to replace artificial turf fields with real grass, citing safety concerns:

In 10 of the last 11 regular seasons, players were hurt more often <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSp?mblid=85e84c35df0b&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on synthetic surfaces than on natural grass, based on data from IQVIA analyzed by NFL Players Association (NFLPA) President JC Tretter. Last year, the injury rate was 37% higher on turf.

There was no significant difference in injury rates during the 2021 season, which the NFL alleges is proof there’s no issue with turf.

Rodgers and other players have long railed against turf fields <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSq?mblid=7d32dab2e161&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for feeling less stable and contributing to knee, ankle, and foot injuries. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the issue is “complex.”

It’s the “easiest decision the NFL can make,” NFLPA Executive Director Lloyd Howell said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSr?mblid=985d59bfb5bc&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday.

Might be time for LinkedIn to offer a certification for “Gaylor”-theorist blatherskites on TikTok to help out the poor hiring manager who’s likely inundated with resumes.

It’s uncommon for an entertainment reporter to cover only one artist, but two Gannett-owned papers, The Tennessean and USA Today, are actually planning to hire two who do. After the job posting in search of a Swiftie went viral on Tuesday, the media company announced that it’s also on the hunt for a reporter to cover the Beyoncé beat <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSx?mblid=ca757c5fe7bd&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Both hourly roles require international travel and pay roughly $40,000–$100,000 a year.

Generous estimates expect Swift’s Eras Tour to take in a record-breaking $1.6 billion, while Beyoncé’s“Renaissance Tour, which wraps up in October, could eclipse that with $2 billion.

In addition to bolstering the sparkly cowboy hat industry, the tours are expected to generate over $4.5 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSy?mblid=436d4aa6ffdf&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> each in spending in North America, according to QuestionPro surveys.

Stat: There’s a reason your social media feeds are full of women whose faces you recognize but whose names you don’t: 79% of women in opposite-sex marriages in the US have taken their husband’s last name, according to a Pew Research survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSC?mblid=faa44ee75e75&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Just 14% kept their names, and they tended to be younger (about 25% of women 18–34, compared to just 9% of women over 50). They’re also more likely to vote Democrat, per Pew. And previous research has shown they’re also high-earners who have made their name in their careers before tying the knot.

Quote: “There’s been a systematic change where employees feel the employer is extremely lucky to have them as opposed to the other way around…we’ve got to kill that attitude and that has to come through hurting the economy.”

In this week’s edition of bosses getting dragged on the internet for saying wildly out of touch things, we’ve got Australian CEO Tim Gurner. The multimillionaire property developer suggested <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bSD?mblid=10fdc8d8cc87&mbcid=32702466.2764480&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that worker productivity would improve if unemployment jumped to 40% or 50%, since mass layoffs spur “less arrogance in the employment market.” This isn’t Gurner’s first time facing backlash—he’s also the one who memorably suggested millennials couldn’t afford homes because they spent too much money on avocado toast.

Good morning. As we enter the thick of the MLB playoff race, here’s a heartwarming baseball story: In the criminally underrated 1994 movie Little Big League, Ashley Crow plays the mom of a 12-year-old who becomes the owner and manager of the Minnesota Twins. Nearly 30 years later, Crow’s real-life son, Pete, was just called up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bOL?mblid=e5d3111612fb&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to the big leagues to play for the Chicago Cubs.

That’s a much more gratifying case of life imitating art than that time Brad Pitt tore his Achilles tendon playing Achilles in Troy, or when actress Kate Winslet and director Sam Mendes got divorced shortly after working together on Revolutionary Road (a movie about a dying marriage).

Our condolences to anyone with an iPhone 14: You no longer own the newest Apple phone.

And you’ll need a different charger if you plan to snag the next-gen iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, or 15 Pro Max the gadget-maker unveiled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPz?mblid=39785f2ad92c&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday. The shiny new iPhones and updated AirPods are juiced via USB-C port, long standard for MacBooks and virtually all other smartphones.

The change puts Apple in compliance with the EU common charger directive <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPA?mblid=340771ae3049&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> mandating that most consumer electronics be USB-C compatible starting in 2024.

The rule is intended for customers to avoid the peskiness (and e-waste) of buying a new charger every time they switch device brands.

Innovation or rebranding?

As with every iPhone release, tech nerddom is split over whether the evolution is impressive or superficial <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPB?mblid=c4a89de58f72&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. If you’re considering shelling out at least $799 for the new phone, here’s what to know:

In addition to being speedier than its predecessors, the 15s ditched the mute switch on the side.

The latest models boast a snazzier camera and enhanced bathroom mirror selfie Portrait mode. The titanium-encased upscale iPhone 15 Pros come with 3D video capabilities that’ll be available at the end of the year, and the 15 Pro Max has ultra-potent 5x zoom to see every last one of your pores.

Big picture: In recent years, Apple has expanded its global market share over smartphone rivals like Samsung and Huawei despite its steep prices.

More than 5,000 people feared dead in Libya floods. Thousands more are still missing after torrential rains from Cyclone Daniel caused two dams to burst, unleashing catastrophic floods <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPg?mblid=c2587bac4f4c&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on the coastal city of Derna and nearby areas. Libya’s split government is complicating the response to the storm: The area in eastern Libya affected by the floods is controlled by a militia leader supported by the Kremlin and is not recognized by the United Nations. Analysts are calling it Libya’s “Katrina moment.”

Kevin McCarthy calls for impeachment inquiry into President Biden. The Republican Speaker of the House bowed to pressure from far-right members of his party and directed lawmakers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPh?mblid=169af0987f98&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to open a formal impeachment inquiry into the president’s purported role in his family’s foreign business dealings. In a break with tradition, the speaker called for the investigation without a House vote or any evidence of wrongdoing. Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries responded by calling the inquiry “reprehensible” and “a political revenge tour that lacks any factual or constitutional basis.”

Cavalcante has been eluding law enforcement for nearly two weeks since breaking out of Chester County Prison, where he was serving a life sentence for murdering his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandão. In a press conference, Governor Josh Shapiro said police have Cavalcante “contained.”

Stimulus checks are long gone, but the impact of shuttering other pandemic-era programs is starting to come to light. In 2022, poverty in the US jumped back up to pre-pandemic levels, and childhood poverty in particular more than doubled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPs?mblid=b34f01df76d5&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> compared to 2021, according to a report released yesterday by the Census Bureau.

The overall supplemental poverty rate, a measurement that includes governmental assistance and geographic factors, jumped from 7.8% in 2021 to 12.4% in 2022—the first increase since 2010.

And child poverty rates went from an all-time low of 5.2% in 2021 to 12.4% last year, an increase that translates to more than 5 million more children falling into poverty.

What happened? Politicians, economists, and even the Census Bureau place most of the blame on the pandemic-era expanded child tax credits lapsing at the end of 2021. President Biden has called for the credits to resume, and Democrats in Congress attempted to extend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPt?mblid=ac5d7edf6673&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> them twice, but conservative members of the party and Republicans blocked them.

Bottom line: These program expirations, paired with record-high inflation, essentially erased any progress the US made in shrinking poverty over the past few years.—MM

Decongestants don't actually decongest, FDA says <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPm?mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A cold medicine spilling out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPm?mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo Collage: Cameron Abbas/Getty Images
Your go-to cold medicine is apparently just as effective as a “Hope you feel better!” text from your friend.

An FDA panel concluded yesterday that phenylephrine, the main ingredient in some oral versions of Sudafed, Benadryl, Mucinex, and other household names, doesn’t actually work <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bPn?mblid=c275127fe964&mbcid=32690416.111797&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Recent studies showed that people who took the drug had no clearer sinuses than those who took a placebo, validating long-standing doubts from some pharmacists about its efficacy when taken orally.

What happens next? The FDA will decide whether to take the panel’s advice (it usually does, but isn’t required to) and revoke the drug’s over-the-counter safety designation. That would require pharmaceutical companies to reformulate medicines containing phenylephrine, and in the meantime, products with it would be taken off shelves.

A ban would alter the market for drug manufacturers: In 2021, medicines with phenylephrine generated nearly $2 billion in sales, according to the FDA.

Pharmacists consider pseudoephedrine a good alternative—though that has its own issues, since it can’t be sold OTC (see: Breaking Bad).

All relief is not lost. While oral phenylephrine may not clear your congestion, the nasal spray version is still believed to be effective.—CC

Heck, even the Pharrell song “Happy” is in F minor. The likely reasons: Culture in general has become more pessimistic, and today’s tastemakers—Gen Z—are sadder than previous generations. Nothing a little “Anti-Hero” can’t fix.

Here’s a potential gift idea for the Catan player in your family: A cookbook <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bMd?mblid=0b828ef84540&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> inspired by the beloved game is being released today. Catan: The Official Cookbook includes 77 recipes, like Over-Knight Oats and Chicken Under a Brick, that call back to the gameplay.

What other board games should have cookbooks? A few ideas:

Candy Land, no explanation needed.

Risk, for an Epcot-like tour of global cuisines.

Scrabble, where only dishes with high-point totals get included. So, it’s pretty much just variations on gazpacho, quiche, and zucchini.

If you plan on picking up a copy later, peace be with you. But if a 688-page read about a mercurial entrepreneur isn’t your preferred way to spend $35, here’s a taste of what Walter Isaacson talks about in Elon Musk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bM0?mblid=5c1d15ac0efd&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Musk’s childhood and personal life: Isaacson writes that Musk’s dad, described as emotionally and physically abusive, is the No. 1 demon in his mind—and that demon, in part, motivates Musk. He also revealed that Musk has three children with Grimes, bringing the total number of children he is known to have fathered to 11. The pair had been keeping their third child, a boy Techno Mechanicus, a secret.

His relationship with another tech titan: A portion of the biography focuses onMusk’s relationship with Bill Gates, including their meeting at a Tesla factory. The tour turned sour <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bM1?mblid=11cfbc2c7b6f&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when Musk said that most philanthropy, which is one of the Microsoft co-founder’s passions, was “bullshit.” Grimes’s take on their dynamic was “I imagine it’s a little bit of a dick-measuring contest.”

The extent of Musk’s influence and power via Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and X: It’s not a surprise that Musk’s world-changing companies occupy significant space in his biography, but what may be news to non-Musk scholars is what Musk genuinely believes about them.

Musk called Tesla “the company doing the most to solve climate change,” at the same time that Gates told him batteries would never power large semitrucks.

He built SpaceX with the explicit goal of turning humanity into a multiplanetary species, even hosting meetings about future governance…on Mars.

Musk originally created Starlink, which made headlines last week for its role in Ukrainian–Russian geopolitics <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIq?mblid=ae2ebb8f961e&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, to generate profit while he worked on the whole interplanetary thing.

He was so committed to his “hardcore” takeover of Twitter (now X) that he hired moving vans to transfer then-Twitter’s servers from one data center to another on Christmas Eve.

Tour de headlines <#> Aaron Rodgers Elsa/Getty Images
Charter customers got to watch Monday Night Football. Disney, which had been withholding its channels, including ESPN and ABC, from the cable company’s ~15 million Spectrum subscribers while the two hashed out a new rate deal, reached an agreement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bMe?mblid=247eb497abfc&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with Charter to end the blackout hours before Aaron Rodgers made his debut as a New York Jet (and frustratingly got injured on his fourth snap). The dispute had the potential to become cable TV’s last gasp, but the deal looks pretty standard: Charter will pay Disney higher rates for its channels and will be able to offer versions of streamers Disney+ and ESPN+ to its customers.

The grocery delivery app said it plans to sell shares for between $26 and $28, giving it a $9.3 billion valuation at most—compared to $39 billion in 2021. And Klaviyo’s proposed pricing puts its value below $9 billion, even though the company was valued at $9.5 billion in 2022. But it’s possible that both companies are pricing their shares low so they’ll have strong opening days, which generate lots of good buzz.

Smucker bets on Twinkies in the snack race <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bLB?mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Hostess Twinkies and CupCakes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bLB?mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
Jelly company J.M. Smucker announced yesterday that it will buy the purveyor of plastic-wrapped cakes, Hostess Brands, for $5.6 billion. That’s a lot of Twinkies.

Set to close by the end of January, the deal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bLC?mblid=d1bde5e6bb89&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is worth roughly $2 billion more than Hostess’s market value. If you’re thinking it would behoove Smucker to reconsider throwing that kind of money at a twice-bankrupt company, think again: The snack business is booming—up 11% last year, according to Circana Group—and Smucker is looking to get in on the nosh gains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bLD?mblid=f5344aeda23d&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Between 2019 and 2022, Hostess’s revenues skyrocketed 50%. Meanwhile, Big Food behemoths Hershey and Mondelez International (which owns Oreos and Ritz, among others) grew their overall sales by 30% and 22%, respectively.

For Smucker, sugary treats like Twinkies, Ho Hos, and Ding Dongs may be especially lucrative—“indulgent” snacks have grown 20% faster than healthy ones in the last three years, CEO Mark Smucker said.

Zoom out: The food industry is consolidating; Campbell Soup, Mars, and Unilever have all recently acquired companies specializing in snacks. And in another sign that quick bites are all the rage, Kellogg’s board of directors decided yesterday to segment its chips and treats into a new company, Kellanova.—ML

Kim Jong Un was not seen sipping Aperol on the Amalfi Coast this summer but he’s making up for it by journeying to Russia this week.

The North Korean dictator embarked on a 20-hour train ride from Pyongyang to the Russian Far East city Vladivostok yesterday, his first international trip since before the pandemic. Kim will huddle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bM7?mblid=c35c307525e6&mbcid=32675585.2751042&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with Russian president Vladimir Putin to discuss cooperation between their two heavily sanctioned countries.

Reportedly on the agenda:

North Korea is considering shipping ammo to bolster Russia’s war arsenal in Ukraine and might send workers to help fill the gaps in its labor market.

In exchange, Russia could offer to supply its totalitarian neighbor with much needed hard currency, food and technological know-how.

Idiosyncratic traveler

Kim Jong Un famously rejects the jetset lifestyle, preferring to globetrot by rail. While the sleepy 37 mph average speed of his armored train makes even the most anemic Amtrak lines look good, the same can’t be said of its amenities.

The US government takes on Google in historic trial <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIc?mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Google logo in pieces <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIc?mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
When Google was founded 25 years ago, the startup was a small fish in a big pond of possible ways to search the web.

Fast forward to today, and Google controls 90% of the search engine market. Whether or not it achieved this monopoly status through illegal means is at the heart of a blockbuster antitrust trial that begins tomorrow.

U.S. et al. v. Google is the US government’s biggest monopoly trial <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bId?mblid=afdca10ccb85&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since 1998, when Bill Gates’s Microsoft empire was taken to court over anti-competitive behavior. What happens in this trial could shake up the power dynamics of Silicon Valley, where tech companies are already figuring out how to manage the once-in-a-generation disruption of AI. Dramatic stuff!

The government’s argument

The Department of Justice’s case focuses on Google’s agreements with hardware companies like Apple that make Google search the default option on iPhones and other devices. The DOJ says such deals—worth billions of dollars each year—represent an illegal abuse of monopoly power by Google to quash rival search engines.

As any student of behavioral economics knows, it requires a lot of effort for someone to opt out of the default option.

An exec at the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo said an Android smartphone user would need to take 15 steps to select DuckDuckGo as the phone’s default search engine.

Still, Google claims that its agreements with other tech companies are not anti-competitive because, even though it may take a few clicks, a user is not blocked from selecting another default search engine.

What to expect

Over the 10 weeks of the trial, business A-listers such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple execs will dish piping-hot tech tea from the witness stand.

Even if Google ultimately defeats the government’s challenge (like Microsoft and IBM before it), don’t expect Pichai to wish anyone well following the verdict. The trial is a costly distraction that may dent Google’s long-term growth trajectory. Have you ever gotten a lot of work done with someone looking over your shoulder?

The gas-guzzling, overweight, costly motors we use today are quite literally your great-grandparents’ engines. In fact, they’ve been powering everything from vehicles to generators for over 150 years without substantial improvements.

So when LiquidPiston invented the X-Engine to deliver up to 10x the power-to-weight ratio <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bHr?lp=text1&mbadid=d89966c32d21a075bfcda0e1f872a4d5&mbadv=a&mblid=0f1a721c4f98&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of legacy engines while achieving up to 30% more fuel efficiency, the world got revved up.

In fact, this technology is such a breakthrough that LiquidPiston has already secured 82 patents, recent coverage from Forbes, and $30m in contracts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bHr?lp=text2&mbadid=d89966c32d21a075bfcda0e1f872a4d5&mbadv=a&mblid=86f2adecfc01&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to improve the mobility of power.

Plus, the X-Engine can run on low- to zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen. So as the world shifts toward lower-emission solutions, demand for LiquidPiston engines could go full throttle.

On his first visit to Vietnam on Sunday, President Biden was greeted by school kids waving American flags and flattery from General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trong, who told Biden, “You have nary aged a day.”

A lot has changed since the Communist Party’s victory in the Vietnam War in 1975 led to decades of ice-cold relations. These days, both countries see opportunity in becoming better friends and business partners: The US wants to strengthen its ties in Southeast Asia to counter China’s influence in the region, and Vietnam wants to sell more stuff to the US, which is already its biggest export market <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIk?mblid=ff5ec9874126&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

How we got here: Thanks to economic reforms in the 1990s, Vietnam has emerged as a global manufacturing hub. And with the US–China relationship looking like a late-stage Jenga game, American companies have started to shift production there. Apple, Nike, Google, Dell, and Microsoft are among the multinationals that are moving to or expanding in Vietnam to reduce their reliance on China’s factories.

So, don’t be surprised to see more “Made in Vietnam” tags. Annual trade between the US and Vietnam has more than doubled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIl?mblid=1c2677c7c1c5&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in just five years, per the WSJ.

Stat: ChatGPT is a literal thirst trap. OpenAI’s large language model consumes 500mm of water <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bIs?mblid=da8b584055f8&mbcid=32669402.1400685&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (about the volume of a 16-ounce bottle) for every series of 5–50 prompts or questions due to the vast amount of water needed to cool the supercomputers that train the chatbot. That finding from the University of California, Riverside, researcher Shaolei Ren largely explains why tech giants have been using so much more water recently: AI data center investments. Microsoft’s global water consumption jumped 34% between 2021 and 2022, and Google’s grew 20% in the same period, per the AP.

Good morning. The NFL is back tonight and your fantasy team, “Stroudy with a Chance of Deep Balls,” is looking dangerous. Nothing can go wrong this season.

Also, we wanted to shout out the hundreds of you who emailed answers to yesterday’s math question on how many points the Oregon Ducks could have scored if the mascot did 546 pushups during Saturday’s game. While they actually scored 81 points in the game, there were many different solutions—every score between 46 and 89, in fact (thanks, Nick).

The most popular answer was 84 points all via touchdowns and extra points: 7+14+21…until 84.

The most creative answer was 59 points in which the Ducks started out with 15 safeties (two points each), kicked five field goals, and closed out the game with two touchdowns plus extra points. Sounds like you had a productive day at work, Menachem.

As one reader wrote, “Math is fun!” We agree. Have a great Thursday.

It was a mixed bag for the meme stock faithful, with AMC hitting an all-time low after releasing a plan to sell new shares and GameStop rising after-hours thanks to better-than-expected sales last quarter.

 

LABOR

The US hit its smallest-ever workplace gender gap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAb?mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Line chart shows narrowing workplace gender gap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAb?mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
Mother alert: Working women have made historic <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAc?mblid=ffc61d811f6f&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> gains, and those with young children are leading the charge.

According to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics…

Workforce participation rates were 57.7% among women and 68.2% among men as of August. This 10.5 percentage-point difference is the narrowest it’s ever been.

For full-time work, the gender pay gap decreased to 16 cents in Q2—or women earning 84 cents for every dollar men earn—the smallest disparity on record (but still not a huge leap from 20 cents in 2002).

These catch-ups have been driven by women between 25 and 54 years old, whose labor participation rates are higher than ever and are outpacing men’s post-pandemic work rebounds. Remarkably, women’s largest increases in workforce participation <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAd?mblid=6d462929942a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> came from mothers of children under five, who are working more now than they did in 2019, according to the Brookings Institution.

Taking the village

Many companies are trying to reinstate in-person work policies, which stand to jeopardize the remote work flexibility that allowed many mothers to do their jobs while at home with their kids. Compounded by the approaching end of pandemic-era childcare aid, working women’s labor peaks are at risk of plateauing—or worse.

More than 70,000 struggling daycare programs may shutter when federal aid stops flowing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAe?mblid=795b9a483606&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the end of the month, leaving the parents of 3.2 million children scrambling, according to estimates from the Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Since childcare often falls to mothers more than to fathers, experts fear that the widespread closure of daycare centers will lead to a pullback.

Over the childcare cliff: A mass exodus of working mothers could worsen labor shortages, cost US states $10.6 billion each year in tax and business revenue, and cause families to earn about $9 billion less each year, the Century Foundation estimates.—ML

Tour de headlines <#> A polar bear in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Sylvain CORDIER/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images
Biden admin moves to block drilling on millions of wild Alaskan acres. The Interior Department proposed regulations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAC?mblid=3e1c31623305&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that would ban new oil and gas drilling in more than 40% of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska and cancel leases issued by the Trump administration that allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. What the proposal doesn’t do is cancel the recent approval of the $8 billion Willow oil project <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAD?mblid=b5dcb43e283d&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the same Alaskan wilderness, which Biden angered environmental groups by signing off on. If finalized, the new restrictions are likely to face a lawsuit from fossil fuel companies aiming to block them.

Hunter Biden to be indicted again this month. Prosecutors expect to seek a new indictment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAE?mblid=4b3ff6dcc35f&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against the president’s son on a gun charge by the end of September after a judge scuttled a plea deal in July. This likely means former President Donald Trump, who is facing multiple indictments of his own, won’t be the only candidate facing awkwardly timed legal disputes as the presidential election approaches (though President Biden himself is not involved in the case against Hunter Biden). A judge ruled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAF?mblid=b92e5e774dcc&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that two of Trump’s alleged co-conspirators in the Georgia election interference case should go to trial in October.

There’s another big storm brewing. For now, Lee is just a tropical storm <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAG?mblid=e883075c9c9a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, but it’s expected to gain strength over the Atlantic Ocean and become a major hurricane, possibly a Category 4 with 150 mph winds. It’s too soon to say where exactly the storm will blow once it grows. It could hit the East Coast, Canada or islands in the Carribean— or it could remain out at sea. Lee is the 12th named storm this year in the Atlantic, where hurricane season usually peaks in mid-September. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts there may be as many as 21 this year.

Your sedan is probably eavesdropping.

Unless your ’67 Chevy is still truckin’, you’re probably at risk. The 25 vehicle brands analyzed, including Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford, failed to hit basic privacy standards, Mozilla found.

That means your car and the services you use in it, like GPS or satellite radio, can collect data that includes your contact info, race, or immigration status, and the systems also personal inferences about you based on where you go.

Nissan admitted that their vehicles collect data on drivers’ sex lives, but didn’t explain what data or how.

Tesla was the worst-ranked car brand in terms of privacy.

The fine print: Most major automakers’ privacy policies don’t have an opt-out choice, nor do they offer encryption for your data.

For the first time in nearly twenty years, The Rolling Stones will release a new original album <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bz-?mblid=b0d206deecc5&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>next month. And if the single released yesterday is any indication, rock-and-roll’s OG frontman, Mick Jagger—now an octogenarian—hasn’t missed a beat.

Ronnie Wood, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger announced their forthcoming album, Hackney Diamonds, yesterday in London along with their new song, “Angry <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bz_?mblid=53c572a7ee25&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.” At 76, 79, and 80, respectively, the Stones are just one example of how the makeup of the workforce <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bA0?mblid=5e6faa36eb30&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is grayer than you might think:

Last year, 650,000 Americans over 80 were still working, up 18% from the previous decade, according to data from the Census Bureau.

There will be twice as many 75-year-old+ workers in 2030 than 2020, due in part to the aging baby boomer generation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.

Can’t get no retirement: Apropos of the new album, Wood told the AP that retirement would be “impossible” because “you’ve got to keep playing.” The sentiment is apparently shared among artists—Willie Nelson (90), Bob Dylan (82), and Smokey Robinson (83), are still touring—as well as political leaders like President Joe Biden (80) and Mitch McConnell (81), and business giants like Warren Buffet, who recently turned 93.

Key performance indicators <#> A thief grabbing an olive under a giant bottle of olive oil Francis Scialabba
Stat: In a heist worthy of Danny Ocean, thieves in Spain operating under cover of darkness last week managed to make off with 50,000 liters of a precious commodity: olive oil <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bAi?mblid=cc5b20ad0c0a&mbcid=32628630.2729424&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. In addition to being delicious, the stolen oil was worth 500,000 euros. Thefts of Rachel Ray’s favorite ingredient (and of olives themselves) have been on the rise since a major drought caused poor harvests, sending prices skyrocketing. The cost of a bottle of olive oil at Spanish supermarkets has jumped 15% since July, according to Bloomberg.

Good morning. Returning to work after Labor Day always hits like a ton of bricks. But as Aristotle said, “It is during our darkest moments (realizing that summer is essentially over) that we must focus to see the light (a four-day week).”

Wise words…which brings us to our next point: If you’re looking to upgrade your writing skills, we’re launching a virtual Business Writing course starting next Monday, Sept. 11. In just one week, you’ll learn how to fuse the clarity of the ancient Greeks with the insight of Warren Buffett to create more impactful emails, team messages, and other writing you do at work. Plus, Morning Brew’s Managing Editor Neal Freyman will take a celeb shot to teach you how to craft sentences like the Brew does.

Burning Man attendees escaped from a muddy morass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btd?mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Rainbow at muddy Burning Man <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btd?mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Julie Jammot/Getty Images
This year’s Burning Man looked a lot like the famously mucky Woodstock.

A monsoon on Friday began dumping <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bte?mblid=23873dc47f7b&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> two to three months’ worth of rain on the counterculture fest in the middle of the Nevada desert, leaving 72,000 Burners stranded there over the weekend. Flash flooding and copious mud rendered the only road out of the venue unusable for most vehicles. Yesterday, organizers finally gave folks the greenlight to hit the road en masse.

In the latest sign that Burning Man has gone mainstream, POTUS was briefed on the sitch in the makeshift Black Rock City.

Organizers told attendees to shelter in place on Saturday and Sunday, urging them to conserve food, water, and fuel. Anyone with enough resources was encouraged to stay true to the communal spirit of the event by sharing with others.

Local authorities investigated a death that occurred during the rainstorm but said that it wasn’t related to the weather.

Departing while the roads were still washed out involved trudging through miles of mud to take a bus or hitch a ride to the nearest city, Reno, in a bigger vehicle. Among those impatient enough to make the trek <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btf?mblid=6017848b700c&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> were comedian Chris Rock and DJ Diplo of the music trio LSD.

Anyone willing to stick around was ultimately able to witness the postponed burning of “the man,” a giant effigy that’s traditionally set on fire on the penultimate night of the festival.

Big picture: The size and stature of the crowd trapped by the storm show how much Burning Man has changed from a low-key bohemian bonfire to a can't-miss event for tech moguls and celebrities. But the transformation is also causing some to question how committed the festival is to its progressive ideals, especially considering the environmental impact of a massive desert rager. Traffic into Burning Man went catawampus at the outset of the festival when climate activists blocked the same road that the climate itself disrupted days later.—SK

Weight loss drugs are the new luxury. Not just because of their high prices, but because the company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, just became Europe’s most valuable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btj?mblid=6a2f6131b873&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, eclipsing luxury conglomerate LVMH. The Danish drugmaker had a value of $428 billion when European markets closed yesterday (compared to LVMH’s $419 billion), putting it on top of the heap. Its share price rose on the introduction of Wegovy into the UK market—where it costs much less than in the US. The company's success has had a big impact on the Danish economy: The nation recently boosted its forecast for economic growth for the year as a result.

Ukraine is getting a new defense minister. Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, who had been in charge of the nation’s armed forces since before Russia invaded, resigned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btk?mblid=f0ba7aee1426&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans to replace him over the weekend. Though Zelensky merely said “new approaches” were needed, the move comes after some called for Reznikov to step down following corruption scandals in the military even though he wasn’t directly implicated in them. His proposed replacement, Rustem Umerov, will have plenty to deal with: Russia’s President Vladimir Putin plans to meet with North Korea to secure more weapons. Putin also rejected calls to reinstate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/btl?mblid=a4cd3cb7ab9f&mbcid=32603393.107960&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a global deal allowing Ukrainian grain exports.

It might be time to plan a Eurotrip.

British Airways, Aer Lingus, and reliably cheap EasyJet all announced sales yesterday, and Norway’s Norse Atlantic Airways had round-trip flights between the US and London available for around $300, according to Bloomberg. The airlines are not only concerned about the seasonal slump, but also that high prices and potential upcoming airline strikes could keep people from taking to the skies.

Don’t worry—we won’t call on you to see if you’re paying attention, but we did write stories about ChatGPT’s role in the classroom, the rise of a trend called “microschools,” the clever ways kids are hiding their vapes, and more.

A final housekeeping note: We’ll send a Brew Review tomorrow but will be OOI (out of inbox) on Monday for Labor Day.

Have a great weekend!

Markets: The Dow shot up yesterday, starting September strong by finishing up its strongest week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsc?mblid=296df601652a&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since July. Investors digested more economic data that’s likely to make Jerome Powell smile: The economy added 187,000 jobs in August, and unemployment rose to 3.8% from 3.5%—signs that the labor market is cooling as the Fed wants, but not so fast that it’s likely to spark a recession.

Stock spotlight: Dell had its best day since the company went public for the second time in 2018 after far surpassing expectations for Q2. Analysts called it an early winner of the AI boom.

Though many of the largest school districts in the country initially banned the bot after “As an AI, I…” started showing up in students’ essays, about three-quarters of K-12 educators now believe it’s at least “fairly important” to teach students how to properly use AI tools, according to an EdWeek Research Center survey <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bse?mblid=241814dcd28b&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Plus, teachers realized that banning ChatGPT at school disadvantages kids who don’t have a computer or smartphone at home, so New York City schools revoked their restrictions in May and Los Angeles schools are now working to loosen <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsf?mblid=7a68a6d0d157&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their anti-ChatGPT policy, per the New York Times.

Training wheels: On

Some educators want ChatGPT to be used like a calculator to cut down tedious work and let students (and teachers) reserve more brainpower for the higher-level thinking that only humans can do.

Possible classroom applications include…

Students using ChatGPT as a debate partner that points out weaknesses in their arguments, or as a brainstorm buddy for essay topics.

Teachers determining whether assignments are too easy by how well ChatGPT performs. They can take it a step further by having students critique the bot’s answer.

Personalized tutoring through programs like Khanmigo, Khan Academy’s beta-mode AI tool <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsg?mblid=c7cfb5828062&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Thousands of teachers and students are enlisting Khanmigo for help with math problems and lesson plans, or to chat with an artificial version of Albert Einstein and other notable figures.

Back-to-school jitters: Chatbot-enabled cheating and plagiarism remain a concern, especially since OpenAI announced <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsh?mblid=469ecfbadb35&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that AI-generated content detectors are largely unreliable. Educators will likely rely on live proctoring or monitoring software. And some already conduct in-person baseline assessments at the beginning of the year, so it stands out if a student who struggles with vocabulary suddenly whips out the word “antidisestablishmentarianism.”—ML

CULTURE

The biggest trend for schools is going small <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsl?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Derek Zoolander saying <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsl?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Zoolander/Paramount Global via Giphy
Picture a school: It’s probably a large brick building that smells like chalk and is full of students. But a new kind of school <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsm?mblid=cf16e415142c&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with way fewer pupils is becoming increasingly popular.

They’re called microschools, and they serve between five and 25 kids who are following home-schooling curriculums and supervised by an adult who may not be a teacher. There are at least 125,000 microschools in the US with ~1.5 million students, the head of the National Microschooling Center, Don Soifer, told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsn?mblid=3bfb3a67eb3e&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> EducationWeek.

What’s behind these tiny schools getting bigger? Many parents turned to home schooling because of the pandemic, and now there’s money flowing into these smaller learning environments.

As states adopt voucher systems for private schools, roughly a dozen currently permit that cash to be used for home schooling, and therefore at microschools.

Nonprofits that support school choice and vouchers are also sending funds to home-schooling organizations, some of which support microschools.

And venture capitalists have plowed tens of millions of dollars into companies that serve this market, per the Washington Post. That includes businesses like Prenda and KaiPod that help parents to set up their own microschools.

Microschool advocates say that their size allows for more individualized, student-focused environments. But critics note that, although it varies by state, they’re usually required to follow many fewer standards and rules than public and private schools, leading to the possibility of poor quality education or even abuse.

Looking ahead…Soifer acknowledges microschools are still in the “early adoption stage.” And since policy decisions have sped their growth, different ones could slow it down.—AR

POLICY

MA students are getting their school lunch paid for by millionaires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsr?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> School lunch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsr?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Christina House/Getty Images
There is now such a thing as free lunch—at least for anyone who attends a public school in Massachusetts.

Students in the state will be offered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bss?mblid=204cece98cfb&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> complimentary food fight ammo breakfast and lunch permanently even as pandemic-era school meal programs have expired, with expenses covered by the newly implemented millionaires tax.

Bay Staters voted to impose a 4% levy on any income of state residents over the $1 million mark last November.

The tax is expected to help the state raise $1 billion for its 2024 budget, over half of which is earmarked for education (including free school meals).

Why is free lunch worth it?

Advocates say that on-the-schoolhouse meals help ensure that kids aren’t learning on an empty stomach, since charging students for lunch makes it more difficult for those from lower-income households to get sufficient calories.

Free lunch does appear to impact how many students eat at school. A federal pandemic-era free school meals program is thought to be the reason why schools served 80 million more meals in 2022 than in the year before the pandemic.

New vapes look an awful lot like school supplies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsx?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of a vape that looks like a pen <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsx?mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Just in time for the new school year, e-cig manufacturers have realized that the only thing more appealing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsy?mblid=3a1409920b83&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to high school students than a creamsicle-flavored vape is a creamsicle-flavored vape that looks like a neon highlighter.

That’s because no one can tell it’s a vape when it looks like something that belongs in a pencil case. Available from the internet, the black market, or your friend’s older cousin Todd, many vapes being snuck into schools this year are ones that look like school supplies—not just highlighters, but also USB drives, ballpoint pens, and more.

Authorities are warning parents about these masters of disguise. Government officials around the country are worried that the undetectable nature of these e-cigs will threaten efforts to curb teen nicotine usage. While the FDA has tried to regulate the vaping industry, e-cig manufacturers keep getting around it.

The FDA banned flavors for cartridge-based e-cigs, like Juuls, in 2020…but that doesn’t apply to disposable vapes, which are used by more than half of the high school and middle school students who partake.

Since 2020, the number of different vape devices in the US has tripled to nearly 9,000, according to the Associated Press, caused by an influx of unauthorized vapes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsz?mblid=fbe3d2c274e8&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from China.

Big picture: As the industry continues to innovate faster than the FDA can regulate, some state governments are trying to stop vaping themselves. Yesterday, a new Texas law took effect that sends students caught with a vape to an alternative school disciplinary program.—CC

BOOKS

Our favorite back-to-school reads <#> Library shelves full of books Aerial Perspective Images/Getty Images
Not all books assigned in English class deserve the SparkNotes treatment. Some, in fact, are worth reading all the way through.

Below, the Brew writers share the books we read in our school days that we can’t stop thinking about.

Cassandra: Notre-Dame de Paris <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsD?mblid=fde6c5ac730e&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Victor Hugo. When my professor assigned this to my comparative literature class in college, I expected it to be lame. It was anything but. The book is more an ode to the city of Paris than the story of one hunchback, so don’t let the Disney movie dissuade you. All in all, it’s a story about beauty, belonging, and redemption, with an ending that gutted me in a way no other book ever has. Thanks, Dr. Stapleton.

Molly: Ishmael <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsE?mblid=7562e1fcbe79&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Daniel Quinn. This novel about a talking gorilla was one of my first introductions to critical self-reflection, both as an individual and for our species. Ishmael is a philosophical excavation of the relationship between humankind and nature, the cultural narratives that prop up our civilization, and the places humanity may be headed if we don’t adjust course. Shoutout to my favorite high school teacher, Noreen McGoldrick, for always pushing me to challenge what I thought I knew.

Sam: The White Tiger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsF?mblid=1030508f9ecd&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Aravind Adiga. Hats off to Ms. Westbrook from sophomore English for what was a surprising page-turner when assigned reading wasn’t always high on my to-do list. The Booker Prize-winning novel felt like a gripping excursion through contemporary India, with biting social commentary. Some of the dynamics reminded me of my native Russia—plus, it was hard not to fall under the charms of the antihero narrator whose social circumstances and personal ambition led him to commit a violent act similar to that of the protagonist in Crime and Punishment.

Abby: Their Eyes Were Watching God <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsG?mblid=0a47a9464e86&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston created a “strong female lead” way before it was cool. Add to that a juicy love story and witty, evocative writing in a unique style meant to evoke 1900s southern, Black dialect, and high school me was hooked on the Harlem Renaissance novel. Props to Mr. Williams for including it on the syllabus.

Neal: A Prayer for Owen Meany <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bsH?mblid=2de775d6d099&mbcid=32587770.3162524&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by John Irving. As a baseball-loving boy who grew up in a small New England town, my brain got wrecked (in a good way) by this novel about two Little Leaguers growing up in a small New England town. Of course, Owen Meany is about far more than baseball, diving deep into themes like faith, friendship, and fate. I’ll also never forget how Owen Meany’s dialogue is presented in all-caps—it makes you vividly hear what the narrator calls Owen’s “wrecked voice.”

Markets: Despite a recent rally, stocks couldn’t climb out of the deep hole they dug themselves earlier in the month, and all three major indexes finished August in the red. Cannabis companies were the clear winner <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bop?mblid=751771f3f8f4&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday following news that the Department of Health and Human Services recommended that pot should be reclassified as a lower-risk substance.

Economy: Fed Chair Jerome Powell might treat himself to a few bloodys at Saturday brunch. A report released yesterday showed that inflation is on the right trajectory back to the Fed’s 2% target. And this morning’s jobs report is expected to show a labor market that’s slowing down but remains on steady footing—exactly what the Fed wants to see.

Tech whizzes and copyright experts have teamed up to reduce the number of people haunted by the words “Ice cream machine’s broken.”

The online repair community iFixit and the DC-based nonprofit Public Knowledge are asking the government to let them fix McDonald’s soft serve dispensers, which is currently prohibited under copyright law. The treat machines are so notorious for breaking down that there’s a website for tracking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bor?mblid=d515035385c5&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> busted McFlurry-makers in the US (about 12% are currently offline). The fast-food joint has even joked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bos?mblid=2d2878bca618&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> about its frozen dairy dysfunction.

The ice cream machines have earned their reputation because they shut down and require tending to when they encounter a problem (just like us, fr). It’s a major drain for franchise owners but a boon for the machine’s manufacturer, Taylor Company, which has an exclusive repair contract with McDonald’s.

Every time an $18,000 McD’s ice cream-maker breaks down, franchisees need to call up a Taylor technician. If a non-Taylor handyperson is used, the ice cream machine’s warranty is revoked.

Fixing the complex machinery costs $350 for every 15 minutes of service, according to Ars Technica, so it’s no wonder Taylor has generated 25% of its revenue from maintenance and repair services in recent years, Inc. reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bot?mblid=032836c34f88&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

iFixit recently broke down a Taylor ice cream machine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bou?mblid=b79b4bd41f41&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and found “easily replaceable parts” gatekept by “cryptic error messages.” A different company actually built an attachable device for ice cream-makers called Kytch that would help franchisees understand and address these confusing codes…but they’ve been in a legal battle <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bov?mblid=994c6d0ea993&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with McDonald’s and Taylor for more than two years.

So, what do the fixers want?

In addition to seeking a copyright law exemption—which has consistently been granted to give independent repairers the means to fix Xboxes and other tech—iFixit and Public Knowledge are asking Congress to pass the Freedom to Repair Act, a stalled 2022 bill that would protect all repair exemptions and the distribution of independently made repair devices, like Kytch.

Right-to-repair gains ground: Apple has long opposed letting customers and unaffiliated repair shops fix its tech, but it’s changed its iTune in recent years to allow customers to order self-service repair kits. And just last week, the company came out in support <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bow?mblid=7eee65432002&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of a California right-to-repair bill.—ML

Flying for Labor Day weekend? Expect to fight someone for overhead bin space. TSA projects that 14 million passengers will be passing through its airport checkpoints between Friday and Wednesday, an 11% increase <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boA?mblid=04d38f00c420&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> over last year. Many of those people will have to bring their passports—international bookings for Labor Day have jumped 44% over last year now that the world has been flung open for travel. For those journeying closer to home, the average gas price of $3.83/gallon is about the same as last year.

UBS makes banking history. The Swiss lender posted the highest quarterly profit ever for a bank in Q2—$29 billion—thanks to its controversial rescue of rival Credit Suisse in March. That acquisition is looking like “one of the biggest steals in financial history <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boB?mblid=c626b3f3b35b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” per the FT, considering the skimpy $3.6 billion price UBS paid for Credit Suisse. While UBS execs have a challenging road ahead integrating Credit Suisse’s businesses into its own, investors seem to think it can pull it off: UBS shares jumped to their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, making it the second-largest bank in Europe behind HSBC.

Clarence Thomas acknowledges GOP megadonor paid for travel. In a financial disclosure form released yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas reported he took three trips <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boC?mblid=e1fbdd8771e4&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year on a private plane owned by Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. Thomas’s relationship with Crow had come under scrutiny after reports showed he did not disclose previous trips with the GOP booster. But Thomas defended omitting those trips, claiming that he was adhering to the judicial guidelines at the time. As for last year’s travel on Crow’s private plane, Thomas said his security detail recommended he fly noncommercial following the leak of the decision that SCOTUS would overturn Roe v. Wade.

Big news for anyone who wants to tell their grandkids that they saw Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour but doesn’t want to shell out $1,000 to see her at a football stadium: This fall, you can catch the tour in movie theaters for less than $20.

Yesterday morning, Swift revealed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boE?mblid=070ba2fdeb70&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that a concert film of her smash Eras Tour will be released in movie theaters on Friday, October 13, and AMC opened up presale tickets soon after her announcement ($19.89 for adults ).

Knowing all too well that any ticketing goof could result in a Capitol Hill hearing, AMC said it upgraded its website and ticketing systems to process more than 5x the peak traffic it’s ever experienced. But to give itself some cover, the theater chain said it was “also aware that no ticketing system in history seems to have been able to accommodate the soaring demand from Taylor Swift fans when tickets are first placed on sale.”

To handle the Swiftie hordes, AMC said it will show the movie at all of its US locations at least four times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays during the initial run.

Exorswift was not meant to be. The Eras Tour movie was initially scheduled to hit theaters the same day <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boF?mblid=934b3d29e103&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as the latest Exorcist film, but Universal pushed the release date of its horror movie up one week following Swift’s announcement.

It wasn’t a cash cow then, but with ChatGPT leading the acceleration of AI this year, the domain “.ai” has become popular among tech startups looking to give their companies some extra rizz. The person in charge of the Anguilla domain, Vince Cate, told Bloomberg <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boL?mblid=62099f51660b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, “Since November 30, things are very different here.” (ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022.)

How Anguilla makes money from this: Domain registrars like Hover pay Anguilla $140 for every two-year .ai domain registration. According to Cate:

Anguilla domains doubled in the past year, to nearly 300,000.

Domain revenue is estimated to reach $25 million–$30 million this year, compared to $8.3 million in 2022. If it hits $26.75 million, it will account for 25% of Anguilla’s total annual revenue, which is estimated at $107 million.

It’s not the only country finding money in the URL bar. The South Pacific island of Tuvalu—with, you guessed it, a “.tv” domain—earns an estimated $10 million a year from its contract with GoDaddy, thanks to the streaming boom.—CC

Stat: Someone should probably check on Corn Kid. For the first time in more than 50 years (save one outlier in 2013), the US is no longer the No. 1 global exporter of corn <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/boP?mblid=b537fd9bf45b&mbcid=32576060.2769239&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, ceding the top spot to Brazil, Bloomberg reported. In the agricultural year ending Aug. 31, Brazil will have shipped 32% of the world’s corn exports, compared to the US’ 23%. The country known for its amber waves of grain has been losing market share of food exports for years, having also lost the No. 1 spot for soybean and wheat exports in the last decade.

The cast of Ferrari was given a special exemption by the striking SAG-AFTRA union to promote the film in Venice (because it’s being distributed by an indie studio), and Driver used the opportunity to call out Netflix and Amazon for not agreeing to the actors’ and writers’ contract demands.

WEATHER

Hurricane Idalia pummels Florida, Southeast <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blh?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cars in flooded streets from Hurricane Idalia <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blh?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 3 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bli?mblid=a2e7ed0387bb&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> storm yesterday before weakening and slamming Georgia and the Carolinas.

The storm was the strongest one to hit the sparsely populated area southeast of Tallahassee in 125 years, fueled rapidly by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. With record-breaking storm surge and maximum sustained winds close to 125 mph, the storm flooded many areas and downed power lines, knocking out electricity for more than 400,000 people across the two states.

The storm has been deemed responsible for two traffic deaths in Florida, and search-and-recovery teams have been sent to the area, though many people evacuated before the worst of the hurricane. It also felled a 100-year-old oak tree outside the governor’s mansion, despite sparing the state capital the worst of its wrath.

President Biden called the governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to assure them that the federal government would aid in their states’ recovery.

The damage may be extensive and expensive

Before the storm struck Florida, insurance broker BMS predicted that any major hurricane hitting the state and moving into the Southeast would constitute a multibillion-dollar insurance industry event.

Last year, Hurricane Ian, a deadly storm, caused nearly $100 billion worth of damage in the area. And with climate change making dangerous and expensive extreme weather events more common, property insurance companies have begun to rethink their relationship with Florida (as well as other high-risk states like California).

Farmers Insurance stopped issuing new home, auto, and umbrella policies in the state in July.

Bankers Insurance and AIG subsidiary Lexington Insurance have also retreated from offering new policies in Florida, while AAA said it would not renew some policies in risky areas.

Looking ahead…the lack of available insurance and the high cost of insuring property in the state may mean some homeowners go without coverage, which can make rebuilding from a storm financially devastating.—AR

Tour de headlines <#> Marijuana farm Needpix
Health officials urge reclassification of marijuana as a lower-risk drug. Leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services urged <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blQ?mblid=7c4b4ed4f2f0&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Drug Enforcement Administration to ease restrictions on marijuana in a letter viewed by Bloomberg. Weed is currently considered a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, putting it in the same category as LSD and heroin, but the letter said it should be changed to a Schedule III substance like pain medications and testosterone. This would not legalize the drug, as many states have done, but it would bring down many of the barriers the cannabis industry is facing, such as being barred from banks, so stocks in the industry rose on the news.

Mitch McConnell freezes again. During a press conference yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, abruptly stopped speaking <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blR?mblid=6be15db375b2&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and appeared unable to respond to reporters’ questions for about 30 seconds. It’s the second similar episode within a month for the 81-year-old politician. The incidents have raised questions about his health and ability to lead his party through his current term, which ends in 2027. But concerns about American leaders’ age and stamina are a bipartisan issue: A recent poll <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blS?mblid=0be0aac4f050&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Associated Press found that 77% of US adults think President Biden, age 80, is too old for a second term.

The Biden administration wants overtime for 3.6 million more workers. The Department of Labor proposed a rule <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blT?mblid=e2e510584781&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday that would require employers to pay overtime pay to salaried employees who make less than $1,059 per week, or ~$55,000 per year if they work more than 40 hours in a week—a big jump from the current rule set by the by the Trump administration, which tops out at a $35,600 salary per year. Before finalizing the rule, the DOL will accept public comments on the proposal for 60 days. But even once a final rule is issued, it could face legal challenges. During President Obama’s term, a federal judge ruled the department did not have the authority to raise the cutoff to $47,500.

Drug stores will start selling Narcan over the counter next week <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blm?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Narcan nasal spray box <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blm?mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Irfan Khan/Getty Images
For the first time, people across the US will soon be able to purchase an overdose-reversal drug that’s as easy to administer as Flonase, without a prescription.

Next week, nationwide chains like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, and Rite Aid will begin selling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bln?mblid=08b0f4128ce2&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> two-dose boxes of Narcan, a naloxone nasal spray that saves people from opioid overdose, in-store and online.

Making naloxone widely accessible <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blo?mblid=35ffac8f4046&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has long been a goal for public health experts because Fentanyl-laced drugs can kill people before paramedics arrive, but some now worry that over-the-counter Narcan’s $45 retail price could be too high for those who need it most.

That’s where insurance (kind of) comes in:

Medicaid and Medicare already cover prescription naloxone, and so far, Missouri, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Rhode Island, and Oregon Medicaid programs said they’ll cover OTC Narcan, too.

While private health plans often restrict OTC drug coverage, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said it’ll fully cover nonprescription Narcan.

But this won’t help the one-fifth of people with opioid use disorder who are uninsured. Some government and harm reduction programs give out Narcan for free—and those groups can now order two-dose boxes in bulk at a $4/unit discount, according to manufacturer Emergent BioSolutions.

Other options include…a prescription-only naloxone generic by Teva Pharmaceuticals, which is widely available for less than $10 out of pocket. And another OTC version, RiVive, will head to stores early next year and is expected to cost less than Narcan.—ML

Tired of yelling at Alexa when you mean to yell at Google? Big Tech has found a solution <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blt?mblid=1354b9810273&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

This week, audio company Harman announced its new line of JBL Authentics: first-of-their-kind smart speakers that will simultaneously employ both Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant.

How it works: The speakers, in addition to looking sick on your credenza <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blu?mblid=4c4c096031a4&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, are unlike other assistant-agnostic speakers. You don’t have to manually switch between Alexa and Google or pick one during setup. Asked Google to play a song? You can ask Alexa to pause it.

Historically, Amazon and Google have not been interested in functioning seamlessly together. But this new move toward interoperability comes as the Big Tech competitors face a flagging market for smart home devices and fierce competition for both assistants from rapidly advancing AI systems.

There’s a lot to overcome: Smart speaker shipments saw their sixth consecutive quarterly drop in the first quarter of this year, plunging by 30%, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon’s Alexa division was reportedly on track to lose $10 billion dollars last year and was targeted in the company’s layoffs. Google has similarly struggled to generate buzz or significant revenue from its Assistant.—CC

Key performance indicators <#> The crowd at Nebraska Volley Ball Day University of Nebraska Athletic Department via Twitter
Stat: Last night, the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers (and their fans) scored a unique kind of victory, setting a new global record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bly?mblid=a6b41df335ca&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for attendance at a women’s sports event. The Huskers packed 92,003 people into the school’s football stadium to watch its women’s team play volleyball, surpassing the world record of 91,648 fans set at a Champions League game in Barcelona in 2022. Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium only holds 85,000 spectators for football (which still regularly transforms it into the state’s third-largest city), but to break the record for this event, seating was available on the field.

The smells of determination and victory aren’t the only ones hovering over the US Open this year—players have complained <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/blz?mblid=cfb00b427c1e&mbcid=32562962.2778832&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that one court also reeks of marijuana. The United States Tennis Association investigated the source of the stench and concluded that no one was lighting up in the stands. That means the most likely explanation for the house-partylike odor is that it’s wafting over from people smoking pot in a nearby park, which is permitted under New York law.

Good morning. Today, in the small town of Buñol, Spain, trucks will haul more than 100 tons of tomatoes to serve as ammo for the world’s largest food fight. Known as La Tomatina, the festival is held the last Wednesday of August and draws a crowd of 20,000 tomato-flingers who clearly don’t mind being left on red.

No one knows how this tradition began, but the town is probably eager to keep it going. Because of the citric acid of the tomatoes strewn everywhere, the clean-up leaves Buñol more sparkling than it was before.

Biden takes on Big Pharma to lower drug prices <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bim?mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> A boxing glove punching a pill capsule <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bim?mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
The Biden administration took its biggest step yet to lower drug costs for Americans, dropping the highly anticipated list of 10 prescription drugs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bin?mblid=9934524df6cd&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that will first be subject to negotiations with Medicare. The medicines include blockbuster treatments like the blood thinner Eliquis from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and the diabetes pill Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Pharma companies are having kittens over this move—one of the most substantial actions ever taken against the industry—and are assembling an army of lawyers to stop it from happening.

How we got here

Medicare, the government’s health program covering 65 million Americans, has not been able to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. But that changed last year when Democrats included the measure in their Inflation Reduction Act, one of the few items in the massive bill that actually aims to…reduce inflation.

The theory is that by unleashing the bargaining power of the US’ largest buyer of healthcare, the government and consumers will save billions on drugs.

And surprise: People like paying less for drugs. Nearly 90% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans were in favor of the policy, according to a KFF survey last year. That overwhelming support is probably due to the fact that as of 2019, the US spent about double <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bio?mblid=eb735a8e3c38&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on prescription drugs compared with peer countries, per OECD data.

But pharma is fighting back

Large drugmakers, including J&J, Merck, and Bristol, have already sued the government over its Medicare negotiation push, calling it unconstitutional. Specifically, they say the Biden administration is violating the Fifth Amendment’s ban on seizing private property for public use without paying for it fairly. The pharma industry also claims that by hamstringing drugmaker revenues, the government will discourage the development of future life-saving treatments.

Looking ahead…the new drug prices won’t take effect until 2026, but we might see this argued before the Supreme Court before then.—NF

Forecasters are warning the powerful Idalia could bring potentially life-threatening storm surges to the state’s west coast from the panhandle down to Tampa, and Gov.

The slumbering crypto industry has been eagerly anticipating a spot bitcoin ETF <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biU?mblid=637eaf99333c&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (as opposed to existing crypto ETFs based on futures) because it could attract a torrent of cash and interest from individual investors.

After being dragged on social media for its hilariously bad AI-generated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biB?mblid=4eb21cb7d7a1&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> high school football reporting, the Columbus Dispatch and its owner Gannett announced they are pausing their local AI sportswriting initiative.

What happened: An article written by AI recapping a football game in Westerville, Ohio, went viral on X <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/biC?mblid=f8187754d79b&mbcid=32551451.3167614&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for being borderline illegible.

The write-up used the phrase “a close encounter of the athletic kind” to describe the game.

One sentence reads: “The Warriors chalked up this decision in spite of the Warhawks’ spirited fourth-quarter performance,” which makes perfect sense.

The Dispatch’s ethical guidelines state that AI content has to be verified by humans before being used in reporting, but it’s unclear whether that step was taken. Another AI-written sports story in the Dispatch initially failed to generate team names, publishing “[[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]]” and “[[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]].” The Dispatch has since updated AI-generated stories to correct errors.

Big picture: Major news outlets are still figuring out how to incorporate AI into their reporting process. Reuters, the AP, and others have published guidelines to define AI’s role in the newsroom, while Google is reportedly testing an AI product that helps journalists produce news stories. But expect more close encounters of the robot kind—experts estimate that 90% of content on the internet in a few years will be AI-generated, according to Axios.—CC

Good morning. The excitement was palpable at West Point yesterday as cadets and staff at the US Military Academy prepared to open a recently discovered lead box that was believed to be a time capsule left by students in the 1820s. Would it contain a flag? A class ring? A note of encouragement to future West Point cadets?

Nope. When two school employees opened the time capsule in front of a packed auditorium, all they found was…mud.

PSA to everyone at West Point: The next time you attempt to pry open a lead box that’s been buried for centuries, please watch a single horror movie first. Y’all just released a demon.

Some of the richest people in the world are (land)banking on a new California utopia.

The New York Times <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bea?mblid=fed7f6ec65d6&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> reports that several of the techiest bros have banded together to buy up $800 million worth of land in Solano County, California—just a few hours outside of the San Francisco Bay Area—with the intent to build a new city.

With Silicon Valley-area real estate constantly getting snapped up faster than you can say “vest,” Big Tech moguls have grown frustrated with the lack of housing options impacting their ability to expand their workforces. The new city, pitched as a clean-energy, public-transit-accessible, high-density urban area, is meant to combat the problem.

That explains why the land’s mystery buyers turned out to be a who’s who of tech entrepreneurship. The NYT found:

The company making the purchases is Flannery Associates, the creation of former Goldman Sachs trader Jan Sramek.

Investors include Sequoia Capital Chairman Michael Moritz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z, Stripe co-founders Patrick Collison and John Collison, and Steve Jobs’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs.

Will it be a real city or a pie in the sky? To the list of billionaires above, this city represents the greatest opportunity since a man made a computer in his garage, not only relieving some of California’s massive housing shortage, but also creating thousands of new jobs, increased tax revenue, and infrastructure investment.

But…California is a notoriously difficult place to build new houses, and most of the property that Flannery bought is not zoned for residential use.

Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district where the purchases took place, told Bloomberg that Solano County’s residents would likely need to pass a rezoning initiative for the development to have a chance—and he said that’s unlikely. It probably won’t help that many residents were sued by Flannery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beb?mblid=ae5a9ac04c1e&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2018 for allegedly conspiring to raise land prices.—CC

A Chinese card game is now a vital business skill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bef?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> People playing Guandan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bef?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> NurPhoto/Getty Images
Every country has its own social activity for business deals like golf in the US and sauna in Finland, but these days in China it’s all about “throwing eggs.”

That’s the translated name of the pokerlike card game Guandan that has grown into a phenomenon <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beg?mblid=2716282f97ef&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> among Chinese business elites as the US and China become less economically entwined.

Foreign investment in China plunged to a 25-year low this spring, so Chinese dealmakers chasing yuan increasingly find themselves schmoozing with local bankers and regional government officials who dole out financial incentives to key industries—and mastering the four-person strategy game has become a reliable way to bond with them. Meanwhile, the importance of having a good Guandan face is only growing since President Biden moved to restrict US investment in Chinese AI, quantum computing, and semiconductor companies earlier this month.

But the Chinese government will probably be watching for foul play. In 2014, the country’s state media urged government officials to stop playing mahjong claiming it facilitated corrupt deals.

Zoom out: The slowdown in foreign investment comes as the Chinese economy is also dealing with slumping exports, sluggish consumer spending, record youth unemployment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WV?mblid=5dbfcd6c7250&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and deep trouble in its outsize real estate sector.—SK

Google Flights upgraded its cheap airfare tracker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bek?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Plane takes off from phone showing new Google Flights features. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bek?mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photo: Google
Buckle your fanny pack: Airport dads are about to be even more responsible now that Google Flights is rolling out new tools for cost-conscious travelers.

PSA: Google announced yesterday that the beginning of October is projected to be the best time to book a domestic Thanksgiving or mid-December flight this year. For US → Europe trips, prices are only expected to increase with time, especially once you’re 72 days out.

The days of widespread near-departure price dips may be over for now, but Google Flights promises it can still help you find cheap tickets <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bel?mblid=590a4f48fd01&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> per trend data with…

Cheapest time to book: Before this upgrade, Google Flights already labeled current ticket prices as low, typical, or high compared to past averages, but now some listings feature a date range showing when flights will cost the least.

Price tracking: Opt-in notifications alert you to price drops for specific dates or for any time in the next three-to-six months.

Price guarantee: A colorful badge appearing next to some flights means you’ll be reimbursed via Google Pay if the ticket price drops after you hit “purchase.”

Zoom out: These updates take aim at other airline ticket services like Kayak and Hopper, which offer similar features but charge extra for their versions of price guarantees.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher waving The Screen Actors Guild Awards via Giphy
Stat: If your preferred way of telling your loved ones happy birthday is letting a celebrity do it for you, you’re in luck: Cameo, the site that lets you pay famous people to make videos, has seen a 137% surge in actor sign-ups <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bep?mblid=b99b8ad621a5&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> thanks to the Hollywood actors’ strike, according to CNN. Since actors walked off the job last month, more than 2,400 performers have joined or rejoined the site. And it’s not just unknowns—SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher reinstated her account this week, making herself available to spout whatever gobbledygook fans request in her distinctive nasal register for $1,500 a video.

Bloomberg reports that Google searches for the sleep-based game have already dropped by half. Still, Pokémon Sleep got enough attention in its early days that one Japanese gaming site caught flak for suggesting players up their game by taking sleeping pills. Also, the game reportedly records sleepers’ farts <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ber?mblid=22a1f2e03534&mbcid=32538107.2781141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> (no judgment on whether that makes it more or less fun).

Good morning. For decades, bitter Central New Jersey residents have languished in the liminal space between the youse guys of South Jersey and the strip-mall bagel joints of North Jersey.

But now, the state is finally telling its neglected middle child: “You exist.” Last week, NJ Gov. Phil Murphy literally put Central Jersey on the map by ordering the state’s tourism department to redraw its map to include the region and promote it in all marketing campaigns.

Glad you’re finally getting the recognition you deserve, Central Jersey. Round of Sanchezes on me at Hoagie Haven.

Experiencing the world without chemically altering your brain is going out of style.

The use of cannabis and psychedelic drugs among US adults hit all-time highs <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baN?mblid=5be21fdb2c13&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year, according to the annual Monitoring the Future study from the University of Michigan. The milestone—which was decades in the making—could be fueled by a number of factors: loosened laws around these substances, changing public perception of hallucinogens, and more Americans self-medicating for mental health issues.

Here are the cannabis stats you should write down before you forget them.

44% of young adults 19–30 and 28% of adults 35–50 reported using marijuana in the prior 12 months, a record high for each age group.

And more than 11% of young adults said they used cannabis on at least 20 of the prior 30 days, double the share from a decade ago.

Psychedelics use is also up dramatically. About 8% of young adults said they used mind-altering drugs like MDMA and psilocybin (shrooms) in the prior 12 months, more than double the rate from 2012.

Silicon Valley’s drugs of choice

Nowhere is the rise of psychedelics more pronounced than in Silicon Valley, where microdosing has become a cornerstone of corporate culture <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baO?mblid=9dfd0b9904ad&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to the WSJ. Tech elites have swapped out Don Draper’s old fashioned for ketamine, LSD, and magic mushrooms to alleviate anxiety or help them think of a revolutionary business idea.

Elon Musk has taken ketamine, Google co-founder Sergey Brinn sometimes does shrooms, and the major VC firm Founders Fund has thrown psychedelics-infused parties, per the WSJ.

But getting high on the job isn’t limited to the tech industry: The number of American workers testing positive for marijuana hit a 25-year record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baP?mblid=6c6aa34bea9f&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last year, according to an annual survey from Quest Diagnostics.

Big picture: More than two-thirds of states allow medical or recreational use of cannabis, and a flurry of medical studies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baQ?mblid=2dabef88b772&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into psychedelics has shown that, in controlled settings, they can be beneficial for mental illnesses. There’s growing recognition in the scientific community that these drugs have untapped potential to help people, but experts also warn they carry substantial risks that need to be studied more.

Unwanted soccer kiss sparks Spain’s #MeToo moment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baU?mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Players of Atletico de Madrid and AC MIlan pose with a message in support of Jennifer Hermoso <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baU?mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Angel Martinez—AC Milan/AC Milan via Getty Images
#SeAcabó, Spanish for “It’s over,” is trending across Spanish social media as a nonconsensual kiss following the women’s team World Cup win has spiraled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baV?mblid=a197291ef18c&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into a broader conversation about women’s equality in the country.

The latest: FIFA suspended Spanish soccer federation president Luis Rubiales for 90 days after he grabbed forward Jenni Hermoso’s head and kissed her on the lips during the event’s victory ceremony. Rubiales claims Hermoso gave him consent but Hermoso denied that conversation took place and said she was “the victim of an aggression.”

A defiant Rubiales refused to resign, prompting the World Cup champions to declare they would not play again until he was removed from his position.

Meanwhile, politicians across political lines and the team’s corporate sponsors <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baW?mblid=d2b5940b486c&mbcid=32527110.3162688&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> voiced support for Hermoso and condemned Rubiales’s actions.

Big picture: Through the #SeAcabó hashtag, women in Spain are using the controversy to spotlight their mistreatment by men that’s never made public. Spain’s acting equality minister called the kiss a “form of sexual violence that we women suffer on a daily basis and until now has been invisible.” And Spanish player Misa Rodríguez shared a cartoon that depicts a girl asking her grandmother, “Grandma, tell me about how your team won the World Cup.” The grandmother replies, “We didn’t just win the World Cup, little one. We won so much more.”

The US Open begins: Tennis hits the bright lights of NYC for its final major of the year. With Serena Williams and Roger Federer retired, the budding rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic has become the most gripping storyline in the sport in years.

The problem is that higher production costs and shrinking demand for vin have made it impossible for French wineries to sell their spiked grape juice for a profit, even if it does have tantalizing hints of oak and leather. The average French citizen drinks about 40 liters of wine per year, compared to 136 liters in 1926.

He also called it “funny” that his song was played at the GOP’s first presidential debate last week because the song “is written about the people on that stage.” Anthony previously said he sits “pretty dead center down the aisle” politically and thinks both parties have flaws.

  SCIENCE

🫘 Coffee beans make concrete stronger. Researchers looking to minimize food waste found inspiration—and then construction materials—in their morning brew. A team of Australian scientists has produced concrete that is about 30% stronger by replacing 15% of the mixture’s sand with charred coffee grounds <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9b?mblid=d48888d0edf4&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Australia produces enough concrete that researchers say all 75,000 metric tons of the country’s annual coffee waste could be repurposed as a partial sand substitute, which would help the environment and reduce the construction industry’s demand for natural resources. The researchers are already working with local governments on future infrastructure projects.

A natural solution for nearsightedness. With half of the world anticipated to be unable to see across a room without glasses or surgery by 2050, eye doctors in Taiwan have found a simple solution to prevent childhood myopia, or nearsightedness: spending more time in the great outdoors. Poor eye health has been a big problem for the island country, where around 90% of high schoolers have already developed blurry vision <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9c?mblid=3062cea73f61&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>—compared to just 50% of all age groups in Europe and the US. But in the few years since Taiwan launched a program to get young school children outside for two hours each day, myopia rates among primary school kids steadily declined from a peak of 50% to 46.1%.

Participation could be in your DNA. If you’ve ever agreed to be a test subject in a genetics study, you may have inherited a predisposition to participate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9d?mblid=ed34430848f3&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from your parents. An Oxford study of genetic data from 30,000 relatives stored in the UK Biobank has found a genetic trait that makes people more likely to accept an invitation to join a research study. It’s correlated but distinct from educational attainment, BMI, and other traits. One researcher said this is a “huge step” toward eliminating ascertainment bias (similar to sampling bias) from genetic research, which would make study outcomes more accurate and representative of target populations.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Why is a ship snooping on an offshore wind farm? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The ship UHL Felicity with the first shipment of wind turbine parts for the state's offshore wind farm by Vineyard Wind travels through the New Bedford hurricane barrier <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Must-haves for a ship setting sail from Miami to New York: Ocean trip playlist, life jackets, and an American flag on its mast. But Old Glory is the most vital checklist item, since the voyage would be illegal without it. US law forbids foreign vessels from transporting goods between American ports.

The 1920 Jones Act requires that cargo ships undertaking domestic trips be made and registered in America and owned and crewed by Americans. And while an obscure maritime restriction protecting American shipping jobs might not sound like it has much to do with your daily life, its detractors say it pushes up prices and ruins your commute <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=00c80f30ade7&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Recently, it was accused of complicating the transition to clean energy by inhibiting the ship-heavy construction of offshore wind farms. The controversy shines a spotlight on the law’s unintended consequences.

The offshore problem

The Vineyard Wind project, currently under construction in the waters off Massachusetts, is the first major commercial offshore wind farm in the US. And the most wonkishly named ship in history, the Jones Act Enforcer, was recently spotted in the area <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9g?mblid=7c8103d77984&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Operated by an industry trade group, the ship’s crew watches over the construction to make sure that non-US ships employ American workers and otherwise comply with the Jones Act.

But not everyone appreciates it: Critics note that Vineyard Wind relies on specialized foreign vessels, and limitations on their use may be inflating costs.

The problem is that the US doesn’t have enough ships to build the wind farm, Joseph Webster of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center told the Boston Globe. He advocates for exempting the offshore wind industry from the rule or making exemptions for boats from US-ally nations (the US has suspended the Jones Act before, after national disasters).

With government funding pouring into clean energy projects, the debate is only likely to heat up.

How did this “Ship American” rule become a thing?

Laws promoting “Made In America” ships for domestic trade are almost as old as the nation, instituted beginning with the First Congress of the United States.

The restrictions were paused during World War I but reinstated shortly after with the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (aka Jones Act). Lawmakers worried that the US was too reliant on foreign ships to move goods around during the war and wanted to ensure it wouldn’t happen again.

To this day, the law’s supporters, including President Biden, tout its ability to protect American jobs in transportation and shipbuilding.

Throwing a wrench into all things water (and beyond)

American shipbuilding has taken a nosedive over the past century—ships are being made more cheaply in Asia—so the Jones Act has become a thorn in the side of many industries as fewer American-made ships are available for service.

The shortage of cheap domestic shipping options might explain why…

* Sending goods by sea from the US East Coast to Puerto Rico was twice as costly as shipments to neighboring Dominican Republic, per a 2012 New York Federal Reserve report.

* New England gets as much as 35% of its liquefied natural gas from abroad, despite the US being among the world’s largest exporters of LNG.

High costs for water transportation mean companies often turn to trucks instead of ships. A hypothetical Georgian farmer packing peaches on a Maine-bound truck rather than a barge might be the reason why you’re often “stuck on I-95 surrounded by smog-producing 18-wheelers,” notes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=7fd2875721f5&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> policy analyst Scott Lincicome <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9i?mblid=126b76893b3e&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the libertarian Cato Institute.

Looking ahead…don’t expect big changes. A bill to repeal the Jones Act was introduced in 2021, but Congress never voted on it since most politicians continue to support the law.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: Scotland for some monster huntin’ <#> A picture of the Loch Ness Monster that turned out to be a hoax Keystone/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Are you feeling lochy?

If so, you might want to book a last-minute flight to the Scottish Highlands, where organizers are holding what could be the largest surface watch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9m?mblid=142e3380595b&mbcid=32519613.3043716&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the Loch Ness Monster in more than 50 years.

Like Bigfoot or a better condiment than mayo, we still haven’t confirmed the existence of Nessie, the elusive sea creature whose legend dates back to the year 565, when an Irish saint was “said to have driven a beast back into the water.”

Nearly two dozen sightings of the monster were reported from the 1500s to the 1800s. But the search for Nessie found a global audience in the 1930s, when a local hotel manager reported seeing a “whale-like fish” in Loch Ness and a subsequent photograph showing a head and neck sticking out of the water captured the attention of people around the world (that photo turned out to be a hoax).

If Nessie does live—which would frankly be a stretch, since she’d be at least 1,400 years old—then this weekend’s quest will be the most high-tech effort yet to find her. Researchers plan to use drones equipped with thermal cameras to take infrared images of the water and will deploy a hydrophone that can pick up underwater sounds.

Modern science has been used before to detect whether a massive sea creature lurks in the waters of this vast lake, and the results weren’t kind to believers. In 2019, New Zealand researchers tested DNA in water samples from Loch Ness, but they only found genetic material from eels.

Still, against all common sense and available data, the search for Nessie carries on. You just know that one day she’ll emerge to the surface, give us a wink, and return to the impenetrable depths she’s called home for centuries.—NF

  COMMUNITY

Here are our favorite responses:

* “I would constantly refill things for them (coffee machines, ice trays, candy jars, etc.). Chaotic good ghost is where it’s at.”—Zoe from FL

* “I would watch an episode of the current series they are on while they’re gone so they possibly miss an important part.”—Nolan from La Crosse, WI

* “I’d make that sound your smoke detector makes when it needs batteries but you can’t figure out which smoke detector is beeping.”—LB from CT

* “Reading over people’s shoulders and turning the page if I got done before them. Or turning the page back and not allowing it to be turned till I was done.”—Lisa from Kearney, MO

* “I’d live in the library and help people find their next great read by nudging it off the shelves toward them. Might also whack a few people on the head with books when they’re being stupid.”—Elizabeth from WY

This week’s question

What is your fantasy football league’s creative punishment for finishing in last place?

Matty’s answer to get the juices flowing: “I’ve never been in a fantasy football league, but if I were, I’d suggest the punishment of making the loser spend two hours in front of a crowded farmers market asking for signatures on a fake petition to ‘legalize cheating on your partner.’”

American auto workers might ditch the assembly lines for picket lines next month. The nearly 150,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) employed at the Big 3 in Michigan voted overwhelmingly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bab?mblid=6746f168d060&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this week to authorize a strike if Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t reach a deal with the union before the current contract expires on September 14.

A work stoppage at the largest carmakers in the country could be the economic equivalent of a head-on collision.

A 10-day strike at all three would cost a whopping $5 billion, the Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimates.

And good luck shopping for a new ride: A prolonged strike could empty out dealer lots. Car inventories are already near an all-time low while car prices sit near record highs.

What might be on the picket signs?

The UAW asserts that workers deserve to share in the automaking trio’s successes. GM and Stellantis raked in record profits in recent years, and Ford has also seen strong earnings.

The union is demanding….

A 40% wage increase over the term of the next four-year contract, and a 32-hour workweek (instead of the current 40 hours) without pay cuts.

The return of benefits like company-provided pension plans and cost-of-living pay bumps that workers lost shortly before the government stepped in to bail out the auto industry during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

The UAW is also trying to protect workers as the industry shifts to EV production, which tends to require less labor, often for lower pay.

Looking ahead…the union could launch a work stoppage at just one or two of the automakers or at all three (which would be a historic first) if a deal isn’t reached. Analysts think a Stellantis strike is the most likely, given that UAW’s firebrand president, Shawn Fain, dramatically tossed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bac?mblid=10534d7557c0&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its contract proposal in the trash on a Facebook Live.—SK

The confirmed departures from Scooter Braun’s management company, SB Projects, are Demi Lovato, Carly Rae Jepsen, BabyJake, Asher Roth, Idina Menzel, and J Balvin. And according to unnamed sources in several publications…

Justin Bieber is trying to break his contract with Braun, who discovered the swoop-banged singer in 2008, though it’s supposed to last through 2027, per Billboard.

Ariana Grande, who has worked with SB Projects since 2013, is also rumored to have dumped Braun.

A source close to SB Projects denied the Bieber and Grande rumors, and Braun even joked about all the apparent defections, tweeting, “Breaking news...I’m no longer managing myself.”

There may be no bad blood: After selling his holding company in a billion-dollar merger with HYBE, the entertainment company behind K-Pop sensation BTS, Braun became the CEO of its US arm in January. A source close to SB Projects told Rolling Stone that Braun is transitioning from his manager era to his chief executive era.—ML

The college football season starts today, but we already know it will be the last of its kind. With all the money grabbing conference realignment <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVY?mblid=36713f80eaf0&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that happened this summer, this is the last season for many long-standing rivalries, tailgates, and conference names that at least sort of make sense.

Week 0 kicks off today in Dublin, Ireland, as Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish (fitting) face the Navy Midshipmen, but everyone’s mind is already on next year.

Next season, the Big 10 (which currently has 14 teams) will expand <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mblid=6b7552a41e7b&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to 18, and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Big 12 will each increase from 14 schools to 16. That means:

This year’s iconic Oklahoma-Oklahoma State and Washington-Washington State matchups will likely be the last.

Next year, athletes playing for Oregon and Rutgers will make the longest in-conference trip in history at 2,463 miles.

With so many changes on the horizon, former Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby told the Associated Press, “It does seem like it will feel like a lame-duck year at some point in time."

More endings: Since 2014, the college football championship has been decided by a four-team knockout tournament. In the 2024 season, the seemingly quixotic idea of an expanded College Football Playoff will encompass 12 teams.—CC

People ranked it the safest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bap?mblid=901f01ae0c70&mbcid=32517533.2777325&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> out of 16 major US cities in a recent Gallup poll. Some 74% of survey respondents consider it safe to live in or visit, giving it a slight edge over No. 2 Boston (72%) and a big one over No. 16 Detroit (26%). But perhaps more striking than which cities most Americans think are safe is which Americans think it. Political leanings played a big role: Republicans were less likely to rate cities as safe than Democrats by an average of 29 percentage points. And the impact has increased over time—in 2006, the last time Gallup conducted a poll with the same list of cities, that gap was only 2 percentage points.

Oh, that’s right. Today is August 24, the most popular day of the year for employees to call out sick, according to a survey by Flamingo, a company that manages PTO. More American workers call out sick today than on Feb. 13, America’s second sickest day of the year and one that suspiciously lines up with the day after the Super Bowl.

If this is because there was a big party last night can someone just let us know next time.

Leader of Russian coup attempt presumed dead in plane crash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3q?mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3q?mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
Two months after he led a revolt against the Kremlin, entrepreneurial warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mercenary-muscle-turned-enemy, appears to have died in a plane crash north of Moscow.

Prigozhin is listed on the private jet’s flight manifest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3r?mblid=101863c8989b&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, along with three crew members and six other passengers, all of whom were killed, Russian authorities said. US officials have not yet been able to verify this, and one person close to the Kremlin said Prigozhin sometimes takes a secondary plane out of caution.

Was Putin behind this?

Unconfirmed reports posted on the Telegram app indicate that the downed plane was shot out of the sky by Russian forces. If true, it would align with widespread theories that Putin was not done punishing Prigozhin for trying to overtake Moscow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DH?mblid=eb96a83da84d&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in June with his guns-for-hire army, the Wagner Group—which has played a major role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—before he took an exile deal that quickly ended the attempted mutiny.

Christo Grozev, a journalist who investigates alleged Russian plots—and correctly predicted Prigozhin’s attempted coup—told the Financial Times a couple weeks ago, “In six months Prigozhin will either be dead <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3s?mblid=a5a613f3efda&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> or there will be a second coup.” Grozev’s team helped uncover the attempted assassination via nerve agent of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Last month, President Biden appeared to nod at the possibility of a similar outcome for Prigozhin, saying, “If I were he, I’d be careful what I ate.”

Shares shot up 24% after the clothing retailer reported monster sales for Q2 and its CEO asserted, “We are no longer a jeans and T-shirt brand. We certainly are a lifestyle brand today.” If only that was still true for Peloton, which continued its spiral into a financial black hole after losing 29,000 subscribers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b33?mblid=46d34fbbeb31&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last quarter.

India spent less money to land a spacecraft on the moon than Warner Bros. spent to make Gravity.

With a budget of just $75 million, India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft successfully landed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3y?mblid=5cb20689b7d5&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on the moon’s south pole yesterday, making India the first country to reach the unexplored terrain after a Russian spacecraft crashed in the same pursuit earlier this week. Its rover will rove in hopes of locating a water supply that is easily accessible—a necessity for more advanced and long-term missions to space.

The landing, in addition to being an immense source of national pride, signifies India’s prowess in launching high-quality moon missions with a Kirkland-level price tag.

The Indian Space Research Organization, which launched Chandrayaan-3, had a budget last fiscal year of less than $1.5 billion. By comparison, NASA currently has over $34 billion in budgetary resources.

India’s $6 billion private space industry, filled with space tech startups inspired by the likes of SpaceX, is expected to triple over the next two years.

‘Fall is here’—Starbucks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b35?mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Starbucks logo frozen in ice cube in iced coffee with leaves and fall colors around it. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b35?mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
People in the Midwest are welcoming the pumpkin spice latte back by slurping it in 100+ degree weather because fall starts when Starbucks decides. The PSL—now in its 20th year of being as synonymous with autumn as billowy scarves and going brunette—and the rest of the Starbucks seasonal fall menu went live today.

The iconic PSL will be joined by new menu items including the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte and the Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso. The fall newbies highlight two industry trends:

Everyone wants an iced coffee. Both new drinks by default are served over ice <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b36?mblid=5f786be36251&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, meaning three out of five of the Starbucks’s fall drinks are intended to be cold instead of hot. Five years ago, cold drinks accounted for about 50% of all the company’s beverage sales—now they’ve jumped to 75%.

R&D is watching TikTok. The Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte took inspiration from a popular customization by TikTokers who ordered from the coffee chain’s secret menu. And Starbucks isn’t the only chain getting its best ideas from 90-second videos: Chipotle added a new menu item to accommodate two quesadilla “hacks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b37?mblid=d395ddd47f13&mbcid=32492255.1731220&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” that went viral on TikTok.

The study also found that local pharmacies like CVS and dollar stores widen social isolation among high- and low-income people.

Good morning. Morning Brew is offering a new course that will have managers running their teams as smoothly as a Nic Cage-led expedition to steal a historical document.

You think Benjamin Franklin Gates just guesses when he assigns someone a task? That he tells the computer guy who looks like Ed Snowden to knock some skulls? Or fails to utilize Dr. Abigail Chase’s archival expertise? Of course not. Gates knows that everyone on his team brings a different skill set to the table and puts them in the right seats for success.

To get your team to that level of execution, check out Building High-Performance Teams <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0V?mblid=4170a827417d&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. It’s a one-week virtual course to help managers build trust among their reports, hire the right people to fill gaps, and provide useful feedback. It begins on Aug. 28, so don’t miss out.

Japan to send treated radioactive water into the ocean <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0X?mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo of the Fukushima power plant <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0X?mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Air Rabbit/Getty Images
Tomorrow, Japan will begin a decadeslong process <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Y?mblid=9c6e88a74921&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.

Japanese officials say it’s a necessary step to decommission the plant, which was wrecked in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami there and suffered a nuclear disaster. For the past 12 years, hundreds of underground tanks have stored roughly 1.34 million metric tons of contaminated water from the nuclear plant and releasing the water into the ocean is considered the most feasible option.

It’s become a major controversy in the region. In July, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cleared the Japanese government’s plan to dump the water in the ocean. But neighboring countries, environmental activists, and the seafood industry are urging Japan to find an alternative.

In Japan, which exported $2 billion worth of fish in 2022, seafood workers are worried that this move will cause reputational harm and cost them their livelihoods.

South Korea and China, the biggest importers of Japanese seafood, have already banned fish imports from Fukushima.

Baby, there’s tritium in the water

Japan says it’s filtered out all the radioactive elements in the water…except one: tritium. This element that can’t be filtered (only diluted) has become the main point of tension around the plan.

Opponents warn of the potential harm of releasing tritium, which emits radiation, but supporters say that disposing of nuclear wastewater with minimal amounts of tritium has been done before in Japan and other countries.

The released water <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Z?mblid=b7ff525d6ae5&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> will contain 190 becquerels of tritium per liter, far below the World Health Organization’s safety limit of 10,000 becquerels per liter for drinking water, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company.

Two plants in the UK release between 400 and 2,000 terabecquerels of tritium into the ocean every year. Plants in Japan also discharged terabecquerels of tritium before the Fukushima accident.

But critics, including the US National Association of Marine Laboratories, argue that there are still unanswered questions and a lack of evidence about the safety of the water.

Looking ahead…after the discharge begins, Japan plans to test seawater and fish near the plant starting as early as next month. But disposing of all the water is expected to take between 30 and 40 years.—CC

The typical borrower could save $1,000 per year under the new plan, the White House and the Dept. of Education said, though some benefits won’t kick in until next summer.

Ikea is banking on it. Today, the furniture seller is opening <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b16?mblid=959d7b55c39b&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a smaller-scale format of its iconic store in a downtown SF mall even after dozens of other retailers have said to the struggling area.

Like the company’s relationship-ending nightstand assembly directions, its 2020 announcement that it would occupy a three-floor store in an abandoned mall was hard to comprehend. At least 150,000 office workers abandoned San Francisco during the pandemic, and nearly 40 stores have shut down in the city’s Union Square area over the last three years, according to Coresight.

Still, the new store’s manager told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b17?mblid=fcb42b244180&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the WSJ, “We do feel it’s a viable place.”

Trust the process: The new SF store is one of at least 17 stores Ikea plans to open in the US by 2026 in a $2.2 billion expansion push. Some of those locations will be mini Ikeas in downtowns that focus on selling Tvärfot table lamps to impecunious unpaid interns who don’t have much apartment space to fill.

These compact stores are performing well in cities like London, Mumbai, and Paris, Ikea said.

But in December 2022, the company shuttered its Queens, NY, location—its first attempt at a store in a dense, urban environment in the US.

Ikea’s arrival is a relief for a city that some critics say could enter a “doom loop.” But signs of life are popping up: The excitement around AI is starting to bring workers back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b18?mblid=0c5ab36e29e2&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> into SF’s desolate offices.—MM

Sailing the high seas may give off Master and Commander vibes, but it’s coming back in 2023 as an innovative way to lower commercial shipping’s carbon footprint.

A cargo ship retrofitted with solid wing sails embarked <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1d?mblid=6d92b6d11b1b&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on a trial voyage earlier this week, chartered by food giant Cargill for a fuel-efficient journey from China to Brazil. A UK company started by yacht racing pros, BAR Technologies, designed the so-called WindWings tech.

How it works:

Two foldable sails <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1e?mblid=b2fddbd66b7f&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> made from wind-turbinelike material were installed atop the bulk cargo vessel Pyxis Ocean and stand 123 feet above deck when raised.

Those sails enable a ship to harness sea wind for propulsion, reducing fossil fuel use by up to 20%.

The concept could be a game changer for the shipping industry, which relies primarily on oil-powered vessels and spits out around 3% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1f?mblid=8fe6b9e0726a&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of global carbon emissions. That existing ships can be modified to breeze along with the winds is particularly promising for making old gas guzzlers cleaner.

But this tech faces some headwinds. It’s unclear whether WindWings will be commercially viable before we all hit the age when a cruise becomes the go-to vacation: Cargill expects <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1g?mblid=9771f06ad882&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> it’ll take at least seven to 10 years for fuel savings to surpass the cost of installing the sails on the Pyxis Ocean.—SK

The bedroom explosion comes at a time when American houses are getting considerably smaller <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1l?mblid=ccf821aa97e4&mbcid=32480689.3167812&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and builders are cutting out dining areas, living rooms, and bathtubs from their blueprints, per the WSJ. Only 33% of existing US homes have four or more bedrooms, but the work-from-home era jacked up demand for a home office (which is presumably what all those extra bedrooms are for…).

A peek behind the scenes: The most popular words submitted were cattywampus, defenestrate, indubitably, kerfuffle, persnickety, bamboozled, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, nincompoop, flibbertigibbet, and copacetic.

But none of those is today’s word. See if you can figure out what is.

There’s only 1 new car left under $20k <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYx?mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Key with money tag <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYx?mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Car-buying wisdom from your financial advisor: “Stick to public transit.” But if the bus simply isn’t your thing, brace for a budget-shattering event: Cox Automotive found <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYy?mblid=8910d4335b72&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Mitsubishi Mirage was the only new model going for less than $20,000 last month.

The humble hatchback may make your mom’s Prius look like a racecar, but its $19,205 average selling price in July really does resemble a mirage in the heat of the auto market.

Cox reports:

A middle-of-the-road new car cost over $48,000 in July, up 30% since 2019.

And used cars were no better. The average July price was $27,000, also a 30% hike from 2019.

The pricey four-wheeled boxes a majority of Americans rely on to get places have been straining family budgets. It takes over 42 weeks of median household income to cover the average cost of a new car, per July data supplied by Cox and Moody’s Analytics.

On top of high prices, high-interest auto loans also burden auto owners, of which 17.1% had a monthly payment above $1,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYz?mblid=f3ec658758fc&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> last quarter—a new record—according to Edmunds. This helps explain why auto loan delinquencies have been rising this year, despite the economy going strong with exceptionally low unemployment.

America’s obsession with jumbo rides is partially to blame for the high prices, since carmakers have ditched affordable compact vehicles. Pandemic-related supply chain snags also threw a wrench into production, creating a car shortage that made auto producers slap exorbitant price tags onto windshields.

But…despite the lack of cheaper models on the market, new car prices have finally begun to decrease slightly <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYA?mblid=16575326ecd7&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as dealers report having more cars sitting on their lots.

There’ll be high stakes for Softbank, which bought the company for $32 billion 2016, as it tries to recover from recent losses by pivoting to an AI-based strategy with companies like Arm at the center.  Bloomberg reports that Arm had been looking to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion but now may seek less as Softbank plans to hold on to more of the company. The IPO is still expected to be the year’s biggest and to help other tech companies, including Instacart, decide whether to move forward with their own IPOs.

Travel is expected to keep booming. If you think your Insta feed is full of everyone’s sand, sun, and fruity cocktail photos now, just wait: Travel is on track to become a $15.5 trillion industry <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYF?mblid=4bacffda0a55&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by 2033, the World Travel & Tourism Council estimates. That would represent more than 11.6% of the global economy and a 50% jump from 2019. The industry group further predicts that some 430 million people will work in the industry—that’s 1 of every 9 jobs around the world.

FDA approves RSV vaccine during pregnancy to protect infants. The agency signed off on the administration of Pfizer’s RSV vaccine <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYG?mblid=709ee1c791f2&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, which it had already okayed for older adults, during pregnancy to prevent infants from contracting the respiratory infection. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for babies in the US. Once the CDC weighs in, Pfizer hopes to have the jab on the market by November. The FDA also recently greenlit an antibody treatment made by Sanofi and AstraZeneca to prevent RSV in infants; it too is expected to be available in the fall.

REAL ESTATE

Reports of the mall’s death have been greatly exaggerated <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYH?mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Photo of the bustling interior of a mall <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYH?mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jeff Greenberg/Getty Images
If you thought the days of going to the mall to nibble on an Auntie Anne’s pretzel and wreak havoc in Bath and Body Works were over, think again.

According to a recent report from analytics firm Coresight Research, malls are back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYI?mblid=b89ac84bc5c2&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>:

From 2021 to 2022, mall sales increased 11% to over $800 billion dollars.

Foot traffic at top-tier malls, where the average shopper makes $200,000+ per year, increased 12% in 2022 compared to 2019.

What’s fueling the malls’ post-pandemic resurgence? While it once looked like the rise of e-commerce would kill the mall, brands have figured out that customers want both. They have invested in “omnichannel” marketing, which promotes online shopping and physical stores to drive growth, per Coresight. Plus, Gen Zers might have missed the halcyon mall days of Aéropostale and Hollister, but they are mall-loyal—a survey conducted by the International Council of Shopping Centers found that nearly as many Gen Z respondents shopped brick-and-mortar stores (97%) as they did online (95%).

Big picture: Retail is a bright spot in the otherwise dim outlook for commercial real estate. In Q2, office vacancy rates soared to a 30-year high of 18.2%, while the vacancy rate for retail space fell to 4.8%—the lowest level since real estate firm CBRE started tracking it 18 years ago. And 1,000 more stores are expected to open than to close this year.—CC

A $44 pickle sweatshirt making the rounds on TikTok is the new “I mustache you a question” merch for the terminally online generation.

And if that sentence gave you a headache, take some ibuprofen before scrolling through the dizzying cornucopia of products available on TikTok’s official catapult into e-commerce: TikTok Shop. The new feature <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYN?mblid=69838de79810&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, which fully rolled out in the US this month, lets TikTok users purchase anything under the fashion or life-hack sun with just a few clicks, right from the comfort of their For You Pages.

The social media app is looking to sell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYO?mblid=a06caa3491a8&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> more than $20 billion in products through TikTok Shop by the end of the year, taking on e-commerce giants like Shein, Temu, and even Amazon.

To get there, TikTok has been accused of boosting videos <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYP?mblid=cb08a9564b39&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that sell products through the new feature, which are marked with an orange shopping cart icon. The pickle sweatshirt, for example, is suddenly all over people’s screens despite having been around since January.

And whether the app is actually putting its thumb on the algorithm scale or not, users are expressing frustration that their feeds are overwhelmed with glorified advertisements—not to mention the fact that it’s now easier than ever to fall into the #tiktokmademebuyit trap <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aYQ?mblid=54ecc20a4f19&mbcid=32468327.2788895&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.—ML

For example, Ukraine’s military depends on Starlink internet, which Musk once threatened to pull from the region. One Pentagon official said: “Living in the world we live in, in which Elon runs this company and it is a private business under his control, we are living off his good graces. That sucks.”

Good morning. We’re lifting the wraps on a new project to make reading the Brew even more fun. Give a warm welcome to Word of the Day.

Here’s how it works: You, the readers, will submit funny, unique words you want to see in the newsletter (think: moist, whippersnapper, circumjacent, etc.), and it’ll be our responsibility to include one of these words somewhere in the Brew each day. While reading, you can guess what the Word of the Day is and we’ll reveal it in the Answer section.

But this requires your participation: After reading the newsletter, scroll back up and submit your word here <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVn?mblid=d356f94d6904&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for Word of the Day. We’ll kick off a test run tomorrow.

The south pole of the moon is littered with craters, can get colder than –300 degrees Fahrenheit, and hasn’t seen a lick of sunlight in billions of years.

It’s also the trendiest destination in the solar system.

This week, Russia and India were racing to become the first countries to land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole, which, despite its hostile climate, could have significant commercial and geopolitical value for any Earthly power looking to extend its reach into space.

It didn’t go well for Russia. Yesterday, its Luna-25 spacecraft crashed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVr?mblid=579e8970d521&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> while attempting a moon landing, or as Russia’s dejected space agency put it, the vehicle “ceased to exist.” It’s a major setback for a country that was the first to land a spacecraft on the moon in 1966 but hadn’t launched a lunar mission in 47 years.

India’s up next: Its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft has arrived in the neighborhood and will try to touch down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVs?mblid=82ac921ec126&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on Wednesday. If successful, it’d be a first for India and a credibility boost for its small-but-growing space program. India has set aside only $1.5 billion for its Department of Space, compared to NASA’s budget of ~$25 billion, per the WSJ.

But why go to the dark side of the moon?

Because there’s ice. Ice, which melts and turns into water, could be pivotal for two reasons:

It’s necessary for supporting human settlements in space, something NASA is trying to do with its Artemis missions in this decade.

Water could also be used to make rocket fuel, establishing the moon as a literal launching pad for missions to deeper parts of the solar system, like Mars.

Using the moon’s natural resources to sustain human colonies and dial up future launches is key to unlock the next generation of space exploration. Think about the $6 delivery fee for your Uber Eats order, and then consider the expense and time required to ship materials ~238,000 miles from the Earth to the moon.

“In-situ resource utilization,” which is the official term for exploiting the moon’s resources, is one area of the space industry where private sector companies see loads of opportunity. For example, Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin was just awarded a $35 million contract from NASA to develop solar cells out of lunar regolith, the crushed-up rock material that covers the entire lunar surface.

Hilary drenches western Mexico and California.

Desert areas east of the major cities that barely experience any precipitation, such as Palm Springs, CA, were soaked with more rainfall yesterday than they see in a couple of years. Hundreds of flights out of Las Vegas, San Diego, and Phoenix were canceled or delayed, while sporting events, concerts, and museums were closed. We were also given our first Word of the Day: hurriquake. As Hilary rained down on SoCal, a 5.1-magnitude earthquake shook the area, though no major damage was immediately reported.

In 7 games, Messi has put MLS on the map <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVA?mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Messi is hoisted up by his Inter Miami teamates after their victory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVA?mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images
In a little over a month since joining Inter Miami, Messi has far exceeded the lofty expectations set for him, boosting the fortunes of his team, Major League Soccer, and brands basking in the glow of his superstardom.

On Saturday night, Messi scored his tenth goal in seven games <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVB?mblid=24b277cf270a&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and his team, Inter Miami (which was really bad before he joined), won the Leagues Cup tournament in penalties. With his 44th trophy, Messi became the most decorated soccer player ever.

Apple: Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+ have more than doubled since Messi joined Inter Miami, one of the team owners tweeted. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a recent earnings call he “could not be happier with how the partnership is going.”

Jersey sales: Messi’s now-iconic pink Inter Miami jersey was the top seller <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=df317f9536e8&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> across all sports for Fanatics last month, the WaPo reported, and an Adidas spokesperson told Reuters that demand for Messi’s jersey in Miami “has been truly unprecedented.”

Ticket prices: Much like Swifties did for the Eras Tour, fans around the country have packed stadiums when Messi comes to town, sending ticket prices skyrocketing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVD?mblid=78e63c699616&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> more than 1,700% on resale sites. In a game that sans Messi would have drawn a sparse crowd, last week’s Philadeliphia vs. Inter Miami match had standing room only tickets going for $241 and field-level seats for $16,200 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=9f1968c2ae95&mbcid=32457734.2523196&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Social media: Inter Miami’s Instagram account has grown to over 14 million followers, more than any team in the NFL, NHL, or MLB.

Bottom line: There may be one person benefiting most from Messi’s otherworldly play—Messi himself. Due to his unique contract structure with Inter Miami, Messi gets a cut of the revenue he brings in to Adidas and Apple.

The company realized it was No.1 back in 2020 and in the past three years has ramped up its sushi offerings to claim even more market share (“When customers think of sushi, we want them to think of Kroger,” one exec said). But it’s not just Kroger—grocery stores across the US are benefiting from consumers choosing an $8.99 California roll instead of an omakase date night. Sales volumes of sushi at US retailers have risen more than 50% in the past year, per Circana.

Pink Floyd as performed by brains. So much for “we don’t need no thought control”—scientists have reproduced the song “Another Brick in the Wall” using the brain activity people exhibited while listening to the Pink Floyd hit. This is the first time that recognizable music has been deciphered from brainwaves <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVf?mblid=71fc81725e0e&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to researchers. Although one scientist said the reconstructed recording “sounds a bit like they’re speaking underwater,” the breakthrough could one day help people with certain neurological conditions translate their silent thoughts into nonrobotic, natural-sounding speech that has rhythm and inflection, similar to music.

These sharks are besties. Great white sharks typically ride solo, so marine researchers are perplexed by the discovery that two have been found swimming together. The tracked sharks, named Jekyll and Simon, stayed within 10 to 100 miles of each other while moving north between April and July. The chief scientist at the nonprofit tracking the sharks said that since the beginning of his career in the 1970s, he’s never seen white sharks migrate together <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVg?mblid=92dac0976c47&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> like this. Blood samples will determine if the pair is related. If so, it could mean that family actually matters to the aquatic predators, who, until now, weren’t thought to care much about those ties.

What does mozzarella have in common with strep throat? Bacteria. It’s crucial to all cheeses, and microbiologists have finally identified the two microbes that make mozzarella taste the way it does: Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Why’d it take so long to unlock the secret to a standard pizza topping? The cheese has a pretty diverse microbial makeup.

  Locals worry about getting displaced from fire-ravaged Maui <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUX?mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Lahaina street <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUX?mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Jon Hicks/Getty Images Last week, a devastating brush fire tore through Maui, reducing much of the historic town of Lāhainā to ashes and killing at least 111 people. But even as first response efforts were still underway, reports <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUY?mblid=5a58bd807aa9&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> began spreading on social media that outside investors were calling up locals, looking to snap up what’s left of Lāhaināns’ property, presumably with plans to redevelop the land.

Almost all of Lāhainā’s housing stock was lost to the flames, leaving up to 4,500 residents without a roof over their heads. And as the area seeks to rebuild, many longtime Mauians fear they could end up priced out of their hometown as it gets turned into a luxury enclave for moneyed mainlanders.

Those fears aren’t necessarily unfounded: The phenomenon is common when disasters hit desirable zip codes. Add to that Hawaii’s fraught history with outsiders and tensions around preserving Native Hawaiian culture, and the question of how to revive the area has become especially contentious.

The prospect of real estate developers paying below-market rates for the land was met with fierce backlash. Local activists flooded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUZ?mblid=62fda2450c0a&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> social media, invoking the history of Native Hawaiians’ land being obtained through predatory practices. The state’s governor even said he’s looking into imposing a moratorium on selling land to developers in the wake of the fire disaster.

Disaster gentrification

Unfortunately, a hot real estate market ravaged by a natural disaster can be a lucrative business opportunity. Developers can swoop in to buy land at a discount, sometimes due to the homeowners’ desperation to cash out their property. Insurance and aid payouts typically “don’t arrive the day after a tragedy,” yet families are immediately faced with relocation costs and other expenses, Sterling Higa, executive director of Housing Hawaii’s Future, explained to Morning Brew.

Prime vacation spots hit with environmental devastation have been gentrified in the past. Outside investors took advantage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aU-?mblid=15861504dbfb&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of Hurricane Irma in 2017 to accelerate tourism development on the Caribbean island of Barbuda, as the government helped them wrest control of coveted land from locals. And research shows <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aU_?mblid=f76a21a21bbb&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Florida communities affected by hurricanes saw higher home prices and tended to attract wealthier residents in the aftermath.

Maui risks facing a similar fate. The scenic island has long been a magnet for deep-pocketed part-time residents (Oprah Winfrey is among the island’s top landowners) and hordes of tourists. With not enough homes to go around, housing prices have skyrocketed and many locals employed in the dominant hospitality industry find themselves struggling to make ends meet.

* The pandemic hyper-boosted the real estate boom, pushing Maui County’s home prices up nearly 35% since 2019.

* The median price for a home on the island is currently around a million dollars, per Redfin.

An exodus of longtime residents from across the state, particularly Native Hawaiians, began even before the fire, with Las Vegas emerging <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aV0?mblid=7fd9a5777e56&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as a popular destination, and the recent disaster could send more people packing.

But does it have to be that way?

Experts say there are ways to prioritize a recovery effort that keeps locals local.

“Keeping many [local] people close and as engaged as possible” during the rebuilding effort ought to be an overarching priority for the local government, Andrew Rumbach, climate disaster recovery researcher at the Urban Institute, told Morning Brew. He says providing temporary housing and other aid, while making sure locals are participating in recovery discussions, could compel more folks to stick around.

To prevent investors rushing in to buy up local land, Rumbach says Maui authorities could temporarily stop issuing building permits. But he thinks the government will ultimately have to focus on keeping home prices within reach of regular families on the island, by using recovery funds for various affordability programs and loosening zoning rules to expand housing supply.

Looking ahead…It usually takes years to rebuild housing after such a sweeping catastrophe: Rumbach noted that even in the exceptionally speedy recovery scenario of the Marshall Fire in Colorado, just 10% of the lost homes have been rebuilt 20 months later.—SK

  DESTINATIONS

  Place to be: ‘The Caribbean of Europe’ <#> A beach in Albania Zhang Liyun/Xinhua via Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Secret’s out about Albania.

The Balkan country is shedding its reputation as a haven for corruption and organized crime to emerge as the hot new vacation destination for Europeans. It’s got stunning beaches (the Albanian Riviera), nightlife <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVc?mblid=886ce6ba3ad6&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and striking natural landscapes…but its biggest selling point may be the low cost.

Billed as a cheaper alternative to European tourist meccas like Italy, Greece, and Croatia, the price of restaurants and hotels in Albania were 56% below <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVd?mblid=8cd8a5d6c22a&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> those in Germany, according to Germany’s federal statistics agency. The Financial Times calls Albania the “cheapest holiday destination in Europe.”

And people have noticed. Tourism to Albania has surged this year as budget-conscious travelers try to avoid the costs—and the crowds—of other Mediterranean hot spots.

* In June, airline passengers to Albania more than doubled from the previous year, per ACI Europe.

* Overnight stays by foreign tourists in Q1 2023 surged 152% from the same period in 2019, according to Eurostat.

If that sounds like an opportunity for Airbnb hosts, you’d be correct. The number of short-term rental listings has boomed 195% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVe?mblid=691f009d9d2c&mbcid=32448284.3165918&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from January 2019 to May 2023, though even that hasn’t kept up with demand for nightly stays, which has shot up 543% in the same period, per data analyzed by AirDNA.

Bottom line: Albania remains one of the poorest countries in Europe. But its low cost and natural assets (30% of Europe’s flora!) are becoming hard to ignore for travelers priced out of places where The White Lotus is set. You might wanna get there before the influencers do.—NF

Good morning. The Women’s World Cup will conclude tomorrow with the finals between England and Spain at 6am ET.

While the USWNT have been out of the tournament for weeks, we Americans can live vicariously through England, which is moving hell and Earth to will their Lionesses to victory. Literally—the Church of England’s lead bishop for sport said that churches can push their Sunday services earlier to accommodate parishioners viewing the game, England’s biggest soccer match since 1966.

But if your Sunday morning vibe is more pub than pew, the UK government is also bending rules to make sure you’re well lubricated for the final, encouraging local councils to let bars open an hour earlier than usual (that’s 11am local time, when the match starts) for pregame festivities.

A series of robots-are-dumb incidents in San Francisco this week has prompted officials to try to halt the recently approved expansion of self-driving taxis in the city.

General Motors-owned Cruise and Alphabet-owned Waymo have been offering driverless rides in the city for a while now, but service was limited until last week, when the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted their request to boost capacity and offer 24/7 commercial rides.

But after a week of Cruise vehicle mishaps that would land them in the Repair Ward if this were the WALL-Everse, the San Francisco City Attorney is asking the CPUC to press pause <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUn?mblid=a9e525af25e4&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Since the robotaxi expansion got the greenlight on August 10…

Ten driverless Cruise cars came to a stop <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUo?mblid=43ddfa789064&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and clogged an intersection near the Outside Lands Music Festival. The company said the vehicles stopped working because concertgoers overwhelmed cell networks, interrupting the cars’ communications.

Another Cruise car drove through a construction site and, in cartoon gag fashion, got stuck in wet concrete <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUp?mblid=b149a1ccfd69&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

A person was injured <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUq?mblid=0de5ed564c0f&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> when the autonomous Cruise car they were riding in failed to yield to an oncoming fire truck, which was responding to an emergency.

Waymo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUr?mblid=4ba5689d0f27&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has had its fair share of incidents, too: Cars blocked a firehouse in May, struck and killed a dog the same month, and stopped in front of a public bus in March. But since last summer, autonomous car accidents have reportedly become rarer, likely because the vehicles learn how to react to certain situations as they encounter them.

The cab hail of the future: Even if the CPUC agrees to postpone the recent expansion, it would likely just be a road bump. App downloads for Cruise and Waymo surged this week, and the companies are gearing up to roll out fleets in Los Angeles, New York, Austin, and Miami.—ML

Tour de headlines <#> Hurricane Hilary in Mexico ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images
Hurricane Hilary appears headed for California. The storm swirling off the coast of Mexico yesterday prompted the first-ever tropical storm watch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUv?mblid=0cd907e13b73&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for Southern California. If it makes landfall in California (rather than slamming Mexico first) it’ll be the first such storm to hit the area since 1939. As the storm moves through over the coming days, more than a year’s worth of rain is predicted to fall in California, Arizona, and Nevada, creating a risk of flooding and other dangers.

Another day, another ominous sign for China’s economy. Chinese real estate megafirm Evergrande, which said in July it had lost $81 billion in the past two years, filed for US bankruptcy protection <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUw?mblid=922b2f9a9f5e&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> as it seeks to restructure its debt around the globe. It’s not the only major Chinese real estate firm to suffer as the country struggles to recover economically from the pandemic. Plus, analysts questioned whether China was having its “Lehman moment” when asset manager Zhongrong Trust missed payments to corporate investors. China instituted new measures to try to shore up its stock market, but investors still sent Hong Kong (which has its own trading rules but includes many mainland companies) into bear market <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUx?mblid=7a64cb24bd59&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> territory.

Drought causes major congestion in Panama Canal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUy?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Ships near Panama Canal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUy?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Luis Acosta/Getty Images
The Panama Canal increasingly resembles a Taco Bell drive-thru on a typical Taco Tuesday. More than 200 ships are waiting <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUz?mblid=21c3ed25623b&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their turn to glide through the global trade artery, and the Panama Canal Authority extended traffic restrictions this week, citing a historic lack of rainfall.

The usual 36 ships-per-day limit was slashed to 32 last month to save water, creating a backlog of idling vessels.

Wait times for large container ships have risen to 16–17 days— longer than it takes them to traverse the Pacific Ocean, one analyst told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUA?mblid=037eba69bb30&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Seatrade Maritime News.

Your shopping budget might get dried out, too

The canal carries a third of the maritime trade between the Americas and Asia, per the Wall Street Journal. Delays and a rule limiting some ships’ weight is already pushing up cargo costs, right as many companies ramp up delivery orders in preparation for this year’s holiday season. And those costs could get passed along, steepening your gift-giving bill.

Spotify almost took away your thunderstorms soundtrack <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUE?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Headphones with static moving between them. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUE?mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
We thought we were the only ones enjoying the sounds of thunder while we wrote this newsletter. But it turns out white noise podcasts are so popular that Spotify considered nixing them <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUF?mblid=5fbc38a4375b&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the platform to bring in an extra $38 million a year, according to an internal memo Bloomberg viewed.

Spotify’s document said that as of January 2023, white noise and ambient podcasts (think rainforest mixes, static, or even lawn mower sounds) made up “3 million daily consumption hours on the platform.”

But Spotify wasn’t making much money off these sounds, even as calming noise makers were raking in ~$18,000/month from the platform’s ads. All while Spotify’s algorithms were sending listeners their way thanks to an effort to push users to the talk-based programs (versus music) that Spotify was investing in heavily to boost subscriptions.

Ethereal box fans can rest easy (for now). While Spotify did consider a plan to thwart bird sound-looping freeloaders by removing white noise and banning future uploads, it didn’t end up going through with the plan to leave you with nothing to fall asleep to but Joe Rogan. Still, some static makers have complained in Reddit threads recently that their content occasionally disappears from the platform.—MM

The company, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, has grown so much this year that its $419 billion market value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUJ?mblid=f56d24b92719&mbcid=32447977.109328&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> eclipsed the nation’s $406 billion GDP, the Wall Street Journal reports. And it’s affecting Danish currency. Per the WSJ, the weight-loss drugs’ strong US sales meant the company was converting unusually large amounts of dollars into kroner, raising the local currency’s value relative to the euro and spurring the central bank to lower interest rates to keep the exchange rate steady.

Good morning. Here’s a fact about playing cards that we’re intentionally telling you in the morning because you would not sleep if you learned about it close to bedtime. It comes from a TikTok video by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

He revealed that the possible number of ways you can shuffle a 52-card deck is so unfathomably large (52 factorial, or 52!) that you could gather 1 trillion people, hand each of them a deck of cards, tell them to shuffle it 1 trillion times per second for 1 trillion years, let that happen across 1 trillion civilizations in the universe, let that happen across 1 trillion universes…and a deck of cards you shuffled right now would only have a 40% chance of matching the sequence of any single one of the decks in this experiment.

From that understanding, you could make a strong claim that no two decks of cards in history, when properly shuffled, have had the same sequence.

Javier Milei’s radical plan to save Argentina’s economy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQb?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Javier Milei <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQb?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Luis Robayo/Getty Images
Who has five cloned dogs named after conservative economists and wants to permit the sale of human organs? The front-runner to be the next president of Argentina, that’s who.

Following his shocking presidential primary win on Sunday, far-right libertarian Javier Milei has been explaining his radical economic plan for Argentina in interviews. Milei, who before entering politics performed in a Rolling Stones cover band and played on a second-tier soccer team, has attracted comparisons to former President Trump for his anti-establishment rhetoric, calls to drain a swamp of the corrupt political elite, and curiously tousled hair (his nickname: The Wig).

While Milei has appealed to Argentines who are understandably fed up with their country’s flailing economy, investors are concerned he’s going to rock a boat that’s already on the verge of tipping over—the peso tumbled following his win and forced the government to devalue the currency by 18%.

The “anarcho-capitalist” approach

If you thought 9% inflation in the US was wild, consider the demolition of purchasing power in Argentina, where inflation is over 115%, the largest denomination peso banknote is worth under $3, and ice cream prices doubled in a month. The country, where 40% of the population lives in poverty, is headed for its sixth recession in 10 years. Milei supporters see his policy ideas as extreme but hope they would provide a necessary jolt to a broken system.

Here are some of the drastic actions Milei said he’d pursue if elected:

Dollarization, or the process of switching the national currency from pesos to the US dollar. Of note: The Argentine government tried a similar policy in the ’90s and it ended in disaster, but dollarization has seen some success in Ecuador and El Salvador.

Eliminating Argentina’s central bank, which he believes is the “worst garbage that exists on this Earth.”

Cutting government spending by shutting down public programs like the health, environment, and education ministries, as well as making citizens pay for the public healthcare system.

Looking ahead…Milei outperformed mainstream candidates in the primary, but the race is far from over. The presidential election is on October 22, and many experts predict a runoff election will need to be held on November 19.—CC

WORLD

Tour de headlines <#> Walmart's logo with green arrows pointing up Francis Scialabba
Walmart is cooking. The US’ largest retailer posted a strong quarter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQf?mblid=321fdee9b75b&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for both profit and revenue in a sign Americans are maintaining their reputation as prolific shoppers. Walmart’s in an advantageous position right now because Americans are stocking up on essentials like groceries and health products—areas where the superstore can beat its competitors on price. Target and Home Depot, retailers that specialize in want-to-have items (as opposed to Walmart’s need-to-have), disappointed last quarter.

Housing affordability got even worse. About those surging bond yields we mentioned in the Markets section: They’re playing out in a nasty way in the housing market, where the average mortgage rate in the US jumped to 7.09% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQg?mblid=2bc56f7a7861&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, its highest level since 2002, per Freddie Mac. Combine those eye-watering borrowing costs with an inventory crunch that’s driven up prices, and you get the worst housing affordability <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQh?mblid=25780a2ea961&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> conditions in four decades, Bloomberg reports. Roughly 75% of US homeowners have mortgage rates of less than 4%, according to JPMorgan, so you can imagine why no one is eager to move and pay upward of 7% on a new place.

Retirement accounts are minting millionaires. It’s good to have money stashed in the stock market when the market is doing well. The number of people with at least $1 million in their 401(k) and IRA accounts jumped 12% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQi?mblid=9472a92a5dfb&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in the second quarter, according to a report from Fidelity Investments, largely tracking the market’s gain during that period. It’s the third straight quarter of growth in $1+ million accounts and close to a record high. But start saving now, because building a hard-boiled nest egg through retirement accounts takes time: The average age of a 401(k) millionaire is 59, Fidelity said.

ENVIRONMENT

Maui officials say the island is “still open” for tourists <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQj?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wildfires reduced Lāhainā to rubble <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQj?mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Robert Gauthier/Getty Images
In the wake of the Lāhainā wildfires that killed at least 111 people and destroyed the homes of thousands more, mixed messages are spotlighting long-standing tensions over Hawaii tourism.

Because of Maui’s reliance on tourism—which accounts for an estimated four out of every five dollars made there, according to the Maui Economic Development Board—officials like the Maui County mayor have rolled back <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aQk?mblid=94a2a93c4384&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their initial discouragement of all nonessential travel. They now say the rest of the island, excluding the fire-torn west side, is open for business, even as some Native Hawaiians tell visitors to stay away <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mblid=86fdc088e835&mbcid=32435239.3166957&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. That’s left travelers unsure of how best to help.

Many west Maui residents, even those whose homes were destroyed, have resumed work in other parts of the island, but locals feel torn between needing to make money and not wanting tourists to visit right now. In a July survey of residents of four of the Hawaiian islands, 67% viewed tourism favorably but also agreed that the industry functions at the expense of locals.

This paradox is nothing new: Hawaii’s economic dependence on an industry that drains natural resources—like last summer’s prioritization of resort landscaping during a drought—has triggered anti-tourism protests in past years. Experts say the islands need a more diversified economic engine, and developing a “green fee” paid by tourists could also help.—ML

Good morning. On this day in 1998, former President Clinton turned everyone’s minds into a pretzel when, during grand jury testimony over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, he mused, “It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.”

Truthfully, it’s been a while since preschool and we could use a little refresher. According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of “is” is “the present tense third-person singular of be.” And the definition of “be” is “to equal in meaning.”

Okay, not sure that helped.

Music execs had nothing to do with songs of the summer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMD?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Oliver Anthony performing Rich Men North of Richmond and clip from Planet of the Bass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMD?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>
Last summer, a Netflix show about D&D made an ’80s Kate Bush hit a contender for song of the season, but this summer two of the biggest biggest bops came from an even more surprising place: nowhere.

Eurodance parody “Planet of the Bass” and conservative favorite “Rich Men North of Richmond” are very different songs whose popularity skyrocketed for very different reasons—but both popped off without the help of traditional music labels.

If you’re still humming “Running Up That Hill”, here’s the scoop on these two:

A song about nothing. Brooklyn-based comedian Kyle Gordon (and his alter ego DJ Crazy Times) went viral with three teaser trailers for “Planet of the Bass <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aME?mblid=7f14cf85cbcb&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” filmed by his brother on an iPhone. Gordon said he has no intention of becoming a pop star, but:

The official music video, released Tuesday, already has more than 860,000 views, and the first preview has 110+ million.

Gordon performed the song at a Jonas Brothers concert in Boston.

A song about a whole lot. Oliver Anthony’s “Rich Men North of Richmond <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMF?mblid=17cccfe75f2e&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” was number one on Spotify’s Top 50 chart for the US yesterday, after debuting a little over a week ago on YouTube, where it’s racked up 16 million views. Anthony says he identifies “dead center down the aisle” politically, but the song’s hype owes a lot to conservatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Walsh, and Ben Shapiro, who praised its lyrics criticizing high taxes and welfare.

Some progressives have even accused Anthony of being an “industry plant” to carry the baton of Jason Aldean’s controversial chart topper, “Try That in a Small Town” or even have QAnon ties.

Big picture: These two “songs of the summer” becoming hits without traditional industry help come as music execs told Billboard <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMG?mblid=471646a44e63&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> they’ve struggled recently to create new superstars the old-fashioned way.—MM

A pig kidney implanted into a human is still working after a month. In a big step toward using animals to help ease the shortage of donated organs, the surgical team at NYU Langone that transplanted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMK?mblid=13a7bdf57afe&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a genetically modified pig kidney into a brain-dead man (with his family’s consent) said it continues to function normally 32 days later. That’s the longest such an organ has worked inside a person, and it raises hopes that pig organs can one day help human patients in need of donations. As of March, when the US proposed revamping its organ donation system, more than 100,000 people were waiting for organs.

An appeals court ruled abortion pills should stay on the market. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit yesterday overturned <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aML?mblid=b3fecbcdad62&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a Texas judge’s ruling revoking the FDA’s decades-old approval of mifepristone. However, the court said the drug should not be available through the mail or prescribed via telemedicine, which would make it unavailable in some states with abortion bans. The ruling will have no immediate impact on the accessibility of mifepristone because a Supreme Court order keeping it available until the justices weigh in was already in effect.

Intel calls off $5.4 billion buy of chip-maker over China delay.

The scuttled purchase comes amid tension between the US and China over technology, especially chips which the Biden administration has worked to restrict China’s access to.

People are shopping more, just not at Target <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMN?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Target logo on a balloon with darts going toward it <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMN?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
What’s up? Not sales at Target, which soared during the pandemic but, much like your family’s bonding time, have fallen off since. After the company revealed yesterday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMO?mblid=8334760cc416&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that sales slumped last quarter for the first time in four years despite a profit surge, the retailer cut its profit forecast for the year.

Why the slump? Target said that lower sales last quarter are partially a result of the consumer backlash over its Pride collection…and over its removal of that Pride collection.

But culture wars aren’t the only problem for everyone’s favorite place to aimlessly spend $50: With prices for essentials rising, customers only have so much left to spend on seasonal oven mitts. Target is uniquely exposed to discretionary spending categories, which account <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMP?mblid=362ed236c477&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for 54% of its annual sales, according to the Wall Street Journal. As for things people do need, groceries only make up 20% of Target’s yearly revenue, compared to more than 50% of rival Walmart’s.

FOOD

Seems like nobody wants their food delivered anymore <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMU?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Person declining food delivery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMU?mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration: Francis Scialabba, Photos: Getty Images
Fast-casual food delivery is becoming less popular as more people get their freaking arses up and opt for takeout or in-person dining.

The dip in delivery <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMV?mblid=c5b0ccad0da6&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is largely because consumers are watching their wallets, analysts say. With pandemic lockdowns behind us, people can no longer justify paying the fees and inflated menu prices associated with clicking “Order” from the couch.

And some fast-casual chains <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMW?mblid=727048563960&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> are getting nostalgic for the goblin mode days.

Sweetgreen has fulfilled fewer delivery orders and more pickups recently, and the salad chain fell short of overall revenue estimates last quarter.

Deliveries for health bowl competitor Cava have similarly declined, with pickups on the up. That contributed to the company’s cautious sales growth forecast for the year (but so have rising gas prices and other universal economic concerns).

Chipotle’s delivery revenue dropped <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMX?mblid=a32baaf8a88f&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> 15.8% last quarter compared to the same time last year.

Companies that focus on delivery haven’t all been hit as hard. Uber’s delivery sales increased 14% and DoorDash’s grew 25% last quarter, but Grubhub’s parent company did report decreasing order volumes across North America this year.

Restaurants are trying to adapt: After struggling <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aMY?mblid=fd29d5741bcd&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with delivery for more than a year, Domino's finally agreed last month to partner with Uber Eats and Postmates.—ML

Key performance indicators <#> A VinFast electric car Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images
Stat: Quick, name a major car company. VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle startup that has yet to turn a profit, probably wasn’t the first to spring to mind. But after it went public via SPAC Tuesday, the company’s stock more than tripled, pushing its market value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aN0?mblid=4bfd8fd913f0&mbcid=32423040.2781404&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to ~$86 billion as of the market’s close. That was higher than General Motors ($45.8 billion) or Ford ($47.9 billion). VinFast plunged 19% yesterday as investors weighed the challenges ahead for the company, but it showed the market still has an appetite for EV manufacturers and SPAC deals—even though several of both have stumbled recently.

Markets: Stocks fell <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aJY?mblid=44c89aef61a0&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on a day that featured good and bad news for Wall Street (clearly, investors thought the news was bad on net). The good news was that US retail sales showed consumers shopped a lot more than expected last month, another checkmark on the economy’s bill of health. But that strong retail sales report also raised concerns that interest rates could remain elevated for longer, and Fitch Ratings also warned that it might have to downgrade dozens of banks, including JPMorgan.

Stock spotlight: Tesla stock is in need of a recharge after falling more than 20% from its July peak. Investors are peeved with Tesla’s extended price cuts in China and its plan to release lower-range Model X and Model S vehicles that are $10,000 cheaper than the standard versions.

The Inflation Reduction Act turns 1 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKF?mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Biden signing IRA <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKF?mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Drew Angerer/Getty Images
President Biden’s historic clean energy push graduated from infancy into toddlerhood today: It’s been exactly a year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKG?mblid=355e31102c3e&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) became law.

Unlike what its inflation-taming name might suggest, the IRA is primarily about pouring an unprecedented amount of federal cash into speeding up clean tech adoption. The landmark legislation unlocks $394 billion of government funding and $367 billion in loans for environmental incentives including…

Tax credits and loans to companies that produce EV batteries, solar and wind energy equipment, as well as energy storage technology.

Up to $7,500 in tax rebates for drivers willing to ditch their gas guzzler for an EV.

Benefits for homeowners boosting the energy efficiency of their homes, and businesses and nonprofits that do the same with their spaces.

Other provisions aimed to offset a US government budget shortfall by lowering the prices Medicare pays for prescription drugs and tightening corporate tax rules.

The winners and losers

The Biden administration touts the IRA as a win for the environment, American workers, and companies building clean tech in the US.

The legislation already spurred major renewable energy manufacturers to invest $271 billion into projects nationwide and has created 29,780 jobs over the past year, according to the industry group the American Clean Power Association.

The US is also becoming an EV battery-making hub as carmakers have announced plans <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKH?mblid=d7ad14b32615&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to open new factories in Michigan, South Carolina, and New York.

But, as with any sweeping policy, someone will end up with the short end of the stick. “Made-in-America” sourcing requirements for some products to qualify for IRA incentives have made EU governments worried that clean tech produced in Europe is now less attractive to American consumers.

Meanwhile, a union representing 400,000 auto workers has been complaining that EV companies seeking to benefit from IRA funding can get away with providing less-than-desirable jobs for its members.

Looking ahead…while the IRA has already catalyzed some clean tech action, whether the law truly ushers in a renewables revolution will only be clear once there are more candles on its birthday cake.—SK

China is known to obscure economic data that it can’t brag about, but there’s very little good news to show off these days: Its economy is having a worse year than MLS defenses against Messi. Widespread real estate problems, flagging investment, and a potential descent into deflation spurred President Biden to call China’s economy a “ticking time bomb.”

The gender gap between men and women dying from alcohol is getting smaller. Research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month found that alcohol-related deaths among US women are growing faster <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKu?mblid=33ba3999118f&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> than among men, a dangerous shift that is alarming public health experts.

The analysis, which looked at 20 years of CDC data, found that from 2018 to 2020, alcohol-related mortality rates for women jumped nearly 15% while men’s rose just under 13%. Men are still about 3x more likely to die from alcohol-related deaths.

What’s making women drink more? Marketing and all of those quippy “wine o’clock” Etsy shirts could be playing a big role <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKv?mblid=6919567c75dd&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in pushing women who want to appear successful to top off their glasses in the same way tobacco companies latched onto women's liberation to advertise cigarettes in the ’60s. Professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Katherine Keyes told NBC that middle-aged, high-income, and educated women are binge drinking the most.

Women really can have it all—even cirrhosis and liver disease. Doctors believe that women’s higher body fat percentage, hormonal fluctuations, and other health traits make their organs more susceptible to alcohol’s health risks.—MM

How much of a price hike would it take for you to give up ad-free access to every episode of Suits?

That’s the question major streaming platforms are pondering as they’ve jacked up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKA?mblid=3c79441c9af6&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> subscription prices by 25% on average, per the Wall Street Journal. A basket of streaming services will cost $87 per month this fall, up from $73 a year ago, according to the Financial Times. The average cable package: $83.

Whatever happened to cheap bingeing? Most platforms (except Netflix) have been operating at a loss, pouring tens of billions into creating a bottomless supply of content. But rising interest rates and impatient shareholders have forced streaming services to answer for their debts, ending an era in which those companies were more focused on adding subscribers than on making money.

Still, streamers are betting you’d prefer to watch the new House of the Dragon season without being interrupted by Swiffer ads—and they may be right. In March, 94% of Disney+ subscribers opted to absorb a $3-per-month increase rather than switch to an ad-supported plan.

Zoom out: Analysts warn that the combo of higher prices and fewer new shows (if any, due to the Hollywood strike) could lead to subscriber losses, but media companies remain bullish that streaming is the future. July was the first month that cable accounted for less than 50% of all TV watching, while streaming accounted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aKB?mblid=eadc065cf78a&mbcid=32412669.3164999&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for a record 39%, according to Nielsen.—CC

The number of homeless people in the US has increased 11% so far this year over 2022, which would be the biggest jump by far in equivalent government records beginning in 2007, according to a WSJ analysis (the next highest increase was 2.7% in 2019, not including noisy pandemic data). Nonprofits and government agencies say the alarming rise in homelessness can be attributed to the lack of affordable housing and rental units, and the ongoing opioid crisis.

Sadly, instead of hallucinating about 15% GDP growth and the US balancing its budget, she said she and the rest of the people who ate the shrooms did not trip at all.

Michael Oher claims The Blind Side’s premise is a lie <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGA?mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Michael Oher with Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGA?mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Matthew Sharpe/Getty Images
Retired NFL player Michael Oher says the popular movie and book about his about his adoption by a White couple when he was a teenager in need of a stable home are based on a recently discovered lie, according to a court filing that accuses Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of never adopting him and cheating him out of millions of dollars.

Oher alleges that the Tuohys, portrayed by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw in the film, had him sign conservatorship papers soon after his 18th birthday that he believed made him a member of their family, ESPN reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGB?mblid=41cee2f432e4&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Instead, Oher’s lawsuit claims his lawyer uncovered the documents in February and learned that they merely gave the couple the rights to make business deals in his name.

According to Oher’s court filing…

He was paid nothing for The Blind Side film. Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy negotiated a deal that made them and their two biological kids $225,000 each, plus 2.5% of net proceeds from the film, which grossed more than $300 million.

A contract that Oher does not remember having explained to him gave 20th Century Fox Studios the rights to his life story with no compensation. Oher’s agent on the deal was a good friend of the Tuohys who also filed the conservatorship petition.

Sean Tuohy responded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGC?mblid=75e072269449&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to the allegations, telling The Daily Memphian, “It’s upsetting to think we would make money off any of our children.” He says he is “of course” willing to end the conservatorship and claims Oher got a share of the movie’s profits equal to other family members’.

Oher has never been a fan of the film. He has said it made people think that he was unintelligent and hurt his football career. “The story has also been a large source of some of my deepest hurt and pain over the past 14 years,” he wrote in a new book, released last week.—ML

New Illinois law protects child influencers. Children who work in Hollywood have long benefited from a California law requiring that a percentage of their money be put aside for them, and now a new state law <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGG?mblid=ce312f75ba71&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in Illinois intends to offer protection for young social media stars. The law, which was signed last week and will take effect in July 2024, requires that a portion of the money anyone under 16 makes on monetized online platforms (including in their parents’ content) be put into a trust for them until they turn 18. The law is the first of its kind in the US, but other states may follow: Washington is already considering a similar measure.

Hollywood reportedly offers concessions on AI, streaming data to striking writers. Last week, studios resumed negotiations with the Writers Guild of America, whose members walked off the job in May. And insiders told Bloomberg that the latest counterproposal <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGH?mblid=f675f358d43f&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers promises the writers that humans, not artificial intelligence, will be credited for screenplays and that writers will get access to data on how many hours viewers spend streaming so they can gauge the popularity of their work (the offer also includes a pay bump). The two sides are expected to continue discussions this week.

Elon Musk and Zuck are still fighting (with words).

In a huge dub for youths, yesterday a Montana state court ruled in favor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGK?mblid=82642ff84115&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of young people who claimed the state violated their right to a clean environment by allowing the proliferation of fossil fuels without checking their impact on climate change.

The case was the first of its kind to go to trial, but similar suits are pending throughout the US.

The lawsuit hinged on two things:

Part of the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) that made it illegal for regulators to consider how new mining projects would contribute to climate change.

A clause in Montana’s state constitution saying the state will “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.”

The judge determined <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGL?mblid=b37c2925915b&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the MEPA provision violated Montana’s environmental guarantee because the state’s fossil fuel emissions contributed to climate change, causing injury to the plaintiffs—including heightened respiratory complications from wildfire smoke and other natural disasters caused by climate change.

Big picture: Our Children’s Trust, the nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs, called the decision a “sweeping” victory, though the state is likely to appeal. Experts believe this could set a precedent for future climate litigation, including a pending federal case, but it’s unclear how the issue would ultimately fare before the Supreme Court.—CC

Bloomberg surveyed ~1,000 Americans who make at least $175k a year (the amount that puts you in the richest 10% of US taxpayers), and half described themselves that way.

Quote: “The technology is very sophisticated. You don’t feel like you have a layer of sunscreen on, and it kind of just feels like you’re putting on a moisturizer in that sense, which makes it easier to use.”

According to the New York Times, you can count Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among the fans of cult favorite Bioré sunblock, which includes ingredients not approved for US use. That’s not unusual <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aGV?mblid=24134b697d52&mbcid=32399563.3163030&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for an anti-sun cream since the US has only approved 14 sunscreen filters, while the EU allows more than 30. The EU and several Asian countries (including Japan, where Bioré comes from) regulate sun protection as cosmetics, while the US FDA considers it an OTC drug—and hasn’t approved new active ingredients for sunblock in over 20 years. But AOC isn’t just incorporating foreign brands into her skincare routine: She says Congress has also taken preliminary steps to address improving the approval process.

Frustration grows in Maui over wildfire response <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> In an aerial view, two men ride a scooter s by businesses that were destroyed by a wildfire on August 11, 2023 in Lahaina, Hawaii. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDu?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
Residents of West Maui are increasingly voicing their concerns with the government’s response to catastrophic wildfires that have devastated the town of Lahaina and killed at least 93 people, making it the deadliest US wildfire in over a century.

Locals told the NYT that community-run volunteer groups have been far more helpful <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDv?mblid=a2d2460e64e1&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in providing resources for evacuees than the taxpayer-funded government, which they claim has been uncommunicative and blocked roads leading to Lahaina, stymying aid for the bustling city that burned down in the fire.

Government officials defended their response and said Maui’s remoteness is hampering relief efforts.

As of Saturday, just 3% of the impacted area had been searched, so the death toll could rise “significantly,” Hawaii Governor Josh Green said.

Prominent Hawaiians tell tourists to stay away

On Instagram, Native Hawaiian Jason Momoa echoed calls from local officials and told people to cancel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDw?mblid=d5672897a5a6&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their upcoming Maui vacations. “Do not convince yourself that your presence is needed on an island that is suffering this deeply,” the Aquaman actor wrote.

Momoa’s plea highlights the complicated relationship between tourists and locals, who rely on tourism for 80% of all income generated on Maui. The response to the fire has exacerbated the divide, with one angry resident telling the BBC she saw visitors swimming in the water that “our people just died in three days ago.” Locals also worry that rebuilding Lahaina could result in more territory ceded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDx?mblid=ed3ae59048ef&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to outside real estate developers already displacing families by fueling higher housing prices.

Rebuilding Lahaina will require a massive effort. Federal officials estimated that wildfire losses could top $5.5 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDy?mblid=83fb834b6a98&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

So, how did the fire start? Officials say they don’t know yet, but lawyers are investigating <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDz?mblid=156d17002f93&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Hawaiian Electric’s power lines as a potential source of ignition, Bloomberg reports. On Saturday, three law firms filed a class-action lawsuit against the utility, claiming that de-energizing its power lines ahead of the windy weather could have prevented the destruction.

In the US, you almost never see law enforcement raid a news outlet’s HQ, but on Friday, police did just that to the Marion County Record <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDD?mblid=c2007784834f&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in Marion, Kansas, making off with computers, cellphones, and servers. The raid raised alarms from press freedom groups, which called it a brazen attack on the First Amendment. The paper also said that its co-owner, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, died on Saturday <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDE?mblid=bbc6a5a0b699&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> “stressed beyond her limits” following a police raid on her house. The chief of the Marion Police Department said law enforcement’s actions will be vindicated once the details are made public.

It could get tougher to track Elon Musk’s jet.

Musk has said accounts tracking his flights pose a security risk, but journalists say private jet reconnaissance is useful for gathering important information (and less important information, like learning which college football coach <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDJ?mblid=ae60b213f114&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> is about to switch teams).

The creepy second life of a totaled Tesla <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDK?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tesla Model 3 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDK?mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images
On Friday, CNBC Executive Editor Jay Yarow tweeted that a Tesla he had totaled last year was now in southern Ukraine, and the new owner was listening to Drake on Yarow’s Spotify account.

Yarow’s story went viral, offering a crash course <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDL?mblid=b567415ea598&mbcid=32388174.3179071&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on the security risks associated with cars that have evolved into computers-on-wheels.

So, how did the Tesla end up in Ukraine? CNBC reporters tracked down what happened to their editor’s car. Online auction site Copart, which partners with salvage yards, scooped up the Tesla after it was totaled and listed it for sale. Someone in Ukraine appears to have won the bid, and the car was shipped from New Jersey to Europe, where its new owner was able to access Yarow’s personal Spotify playlists.

Yarow contacted Tesla to see how he could log out of his former car, and the company instructed him to disconnect the vehicle from his account. But several steps (like entering new owner information) were impossible, and simply disconnecting an account from the car does not prevent your data from being extracted, experts told CNBC. Tesla should have had a “wipe all my info from this car” feature long ago, they said.

Big picture: In the age of internet-connected vehicles, consumers might want to be more cautious about syncing data from their phones onto their car apps. You never know who’s going to get in the driver’s seat next.

Retailers take the earnings stage. Walmart, Home Depot, and Target will give us a peek into consumer spending, which drives two-thirds of the US economy. Americans filling up their shopping carts (despite interest rates rising to a 22-year high) is one of the main reasons those recession predictions haven’t materialized yet.

In a new Realtor.com survey, 85% of couples who created a wedding registry in the last two years said they would have preferred to receive cash toward a down payment on a house rather than a standard registry gift that will collect dust in the imaginary house they can’t afford. If given the option to redo their registry, 80% would have created a category for housing assistance.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Willem Dafoe saying Spider-Man/Sony Pictures Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even improve your memory while you sleep.

Sleep smells boost memory. If you’ve ever teased someone for using an oil diffuser at night, they will not forget it. New research has found an overwhelmingly positive correlation between cognitive performance and sniffing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC7?mblid=6f0c92b37277&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> full-strength natural oils while sleeping. In a trial, adults between 60 and 85 turned on a diffuser before bedtime and slept with any natural oil scent for two hours per night for six months. They performed 226% better on a memory test than those in the control group, according to the study out of the University of California, Irvine. The researchers say their findings mean that smell therapies, which are sometimes used with dementia patients, could be deployed overnight instead of taking up waking hours.

Mood might be key to charitable giving. A recent study indicates that people donate to charity when they’re already feeling happy, which differs from the common theory that people get a happiness boost after donating to charity. By analyzing tweets from more than 20,000 Twitter users who contributed to Wikipedia, researchers found an increase in positive-emotion language up to an hour before donations <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC8?mblid=9cfde17f6be0&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> took place, followed by a return to neutral happiness levels. But they also say their findings are limited by only assessing tweets. Some happy donors might just be more likely to post about their charity work online, whereas other donors (who might feel happy or sad or neither) might keep it to themselves.

Don’t eat these square watermelons. Every few years, it seems our social media feeds obsess anew over Japan’s aesthetically pleasing cube-shaped watermelons <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC9?mblid=5ac3d2f44d60&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, as they did last weekend. The first square watermelon was grown in 1975 in Zentsuji, Japan, simply by putting a budding melon in a transparent box—no special seeds required. And because the fruits grow into whatever shape they’re forced into, triangular and heart-shaped watermelons can also be found in Japan. But before you drop up to $800 to get one shipped to your kitchen counter, you should know they’re practically inedible. Square watermelons are picked before they’re ripe in order to last as prized display items for longer, so you wouldn’t enjoy eating the expensive status symbols (though that didn’t stop this guy <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aCa?mblid=efbd3155deb9&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>).—ML

  How to harness pollution to fight climate change <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Cargo ship belching pollution <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Felix Cesare/Getty Images Cargo ships spewing plumes of sulfuric smoke sounds like something worthy of an indignant “How dare you?” from Greta Thunberg.

But this type of pollution might actually have been slowing climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Sulfur-spitting ships leave a cloud trail that can function as a jumbo beach umbrella, temporarily keeping the ocean waters cool by reflecting sunlight.

How do we know? As science vlogger Hank Green recently spotlighted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az_?mblid=3413e804d3fe&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, we’ve all been involved in a massive, accidental experiment in geoengineering—the controversial concept of altering the Earth’s environment to curb climate change—and we didn’t even know it.

In 2020, a new UN rule for fuels that the shipping industry could use took effect, and ships now belch out over 80% less sulfur. While reducing emissions of a chemical that’s harmful to human health is a win for everyone, it’s also become an unintended field test demonstrating how chemical clouds could be used to keep the Earth from overheating.

* Some scientists believe the new absence of these clouds partially caused this year’s record-breaking summer temps in the Atlantic Ocean.

* Although other factors like El Niño and the eruption of an underwater volcano in the Pacific Ocean last year likely played a role, the reduction of sulfur dioxide clouds is believed to be one of the reasons oceans have been so hot, causing record temperatures on land.

While the human-caused phenomenon is unintentional, some experts have long considered making reflective clouds deliberately (or boosting existing ones) to stave off global warming—even though the planet-scale risks of this approach keep it from becoming most scientists’ Plan A for climate change.

The Pandora’s box of climate engineering

Sucking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, aka carbon removal, is the least contentious geoengineering tool. Experts disagree over how well it works, but no one is worried it’ll turn our planet into an IRL environmental apocalypse film.

The same can’t be said about repelling sunrays by spraying sulfur aerosol into the stratosphere or enriching ocean clouds with sea salt to make them more reflective. Many climate scientists believe these methods are too risky since their effects aren’t entirely predictable and won’t be uniform across the planet. Others see geoengineering as a distraction from efforts to cut carbon emissions.

In a simulation run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, using sulfuric aerosols as a sun blocker made winters rainier in Scandinavia and drier in Mediterranean Europe. This would be disruptive to local agriculture and ecosystems. These disparate effects are bound to be a big sticking point in international relations, threatening to turn every UN meeting into a screaming match over who controls the “global thermostat.”

Researchers also warn that once humanity embarks on the path of artificial sunlight reflection, it might be hard to turn back— studies suggest that ceasing a geoengineering effort abruptly could cause major climate trouble.

Not all experiments are accidents

Some private companies have undertaken small-scale efforts to test sun ray-reflecting technologies.

One researcher from the UK teamed up with a space startup, European Astrotech, to test a system called “stratospheric aerosol transport and nucleation” (the acronym probably isn’t the best for a controversial emerging tech: SATAN). With a $1,000 balloon system, it achieved what might’ve been the first successful delivery of sun-blocking aerosols to the stratosphere, according to unpublicized reporting obtained by the MIT Technology Review.

Though the experiment was properly permitted and released just 400 grams of sulfur, scientists opposed to these efforts are unsettled by the fact that someone with a bit of cash and a startup partner is testing tech that could change the weather with minimal oversight.

It’s now not a matter of if but when geoengineering happens, climate economist and geoengineering research proponent Gernot Wagner told Morning Brew. He thinks scientists should investigate potential effects now so that the world isn’t blindsided when some nation decides to plow ahead with it.

The government is taking geoengineering seriously…the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently released a report outlining what research could be done to evaluate the risks and benefits of the technology.—SK

  Place to be: The Iowa State Fair <#> Albert the super bull, which weighs 3,042 pounds, is taken for a walk by Randy Dreher at the Iowa State Fair Scott Olson/Getty Images It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Opened August 10 and running through next weekend, the sprawling Iowa State Fair is an annual celebration of agriculture, American democracy, and fried foods on a stick.

While every state thinks its late-summer fair is the best, Iowa’s (est. 1854) stands out from the pack. Here’s why.

Creative competitions:

* The state fair’s husband calling contest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAb?mblid=e9c2fd0bba90&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> goes viral every few months, and it is personally one of my favorite videos ever.

* The Mr. Legs contest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAc?mblid=f8acb0dc424b&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> awards the man at the fair who’s got the best legs.

* Bagging groceries becomes a full-contact sport in a competition that judges contestants based on speed, proper item arrangement, and weight distribution among bags (underrated skill).

* And you can’t miss the butter cow <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAd?mblid=486a766622dc&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

Creative food: Do not come to the Iowa State Fair if you prefer eating with utensils, because here, any food you can imagine—hard-boiled eggs, pickles, edible cookie dough, deep-fried strawberry shortcake—comes served on a stick. No matter what freshly impaled foods you try, you should always save room for the pork chop on a stick, ranked the No. 1 Iowa State Fair dish <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAe?mblid=888cca563aca&mbcid=32374526.3111108&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by Des Moines Register readers. Checks out: Iowa is the top US state for pork production.

Politics: You might think wandering around a fairground would help you avoid the political news cycle, but at the Iowa State Fair, there’s no escape. Because of Iowa’s traditional role as the first state to vote in presidential primaries, candidates head to the fair the year before an election to schmooze with voters. Though Democrats booted their Iowa caucuses to later in the calendar this year, the state is still up first for Republicans in January. This year, 13 presidential candidates are scheduled to hit the fair’s Soapbox stage.—NF

A hub for Hawaiian heritage has burned to the ground <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az8?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Maui town of Lāhainā was largely destroyed in a wildfire. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az8?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images
The Maui town of Lāhainā will never be the same. This week, unprecedented wildfires ripped through the historic area where the Hawaiian Kingdom’s constitution was drafted, destroying cherished cultural sites.

The blazes are now mostly contained, but at least 53 people have died, making this one of the deadliest US wildfires in decades. The death toll is likely to rise as search and rescue efforts continue. An investigation into the cause of the fire has not yet begun, but unmanaged, nonnative grasslands are believed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az9?mblid=f1f211e0e28d&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to have fueled its spread, combined with dry air, drought, and winds from a passing hurricane.

“The whole town was devastated. Lāhainā was decimated,” Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aza?mblid=b7c18c98ef93&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. At least 1,000 buildings have been wrecked.

Front Street, the town’s popular stretch of restaurants, bars, and stores, has been reduced to ash <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azb?mblid=09e5efccfda3&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. “Pretty much everybody I know lost everything,” one resident told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azc?mblid=e19d29eebf54&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> MSNBC.

The town center—one of 60 nationally recognized historic sites in the area—was destroyed, as was the church where Christianity got its start in Hawaii in the early 1800s. Its graveyard is the burial site for some members of old Hawaiian royalty.

The largest banyan <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azd?mblid=79189a99f37b&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> fig tree in the US, planted in Lāhainā in 1873, is charred but still standing.

Cell phone and internet service remained heavily disrupted, so people have been using social media to try <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aze?mblid=ea4e45c15491&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to locate <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azf?mblid=919c276517af&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> missing relatives. For some people on the island, Apple Emergency SOS was the only way to contact <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azg?mblid=dddc87427e57&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> first responders.

Burnt docks and wrecked boats have complicated seaborne relief efforts. Several airlines have added flights to help get people out of Maui.

The recovery…will take years, authorities said. Maui’s economy, which was just bouncing back after the pandemic, will suffer—80% of the island’s money is generated by tourism. Lāhainā, once the capital of pre-colonized Hawaii, was a major destination for visitors.—ML

In exchange, the US promised to release multiple Iranians incarcerated for violating sanctions and will allow Iran to use $6 billion of frozen funds for humanitarian purposes, multiple news outlets reported. The agreement comes as a number of Americans remain in foreign prisons on dubious charges, including WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is detained in Russia.

But several employees claimed they were flagged erroneously, and Amazon admitted it might be true. The company’s Slack was popping off with employees venting about what they perceived as a tone-deaf email and a lack of transparency around how the tracking worked, per Insider. When Amazon’s return-to-office policy was imposed in February, some employees walked out in protest and circulated a petition to nix it.

The price of college is rising, and for once, we can’t blame inflation. Spending increased <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azl?mblid=4ab242a1809a&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> by 38% at the median flagship school (the best known and usually the oldest public university in each state) between 2002 and 2022—and they passed the tab to students, contributing to the $1.6 trillion student debt crisis, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis of the 50 schools’ financial statements.

Driving the increase: Over the 20 years analyzed, the median flagship’s salaries and benefits rose by ~40%, spending on athletic coaches jumped by 50%, and millions of dollars were pumped into new construction and renovations, according to data the WSJ analyzed from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database. Administrative costs have also become a greater share <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azm?mblid=115a21697559&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of institutional spending, per US News and the National Center for Education Statistics.

But that shiny new student union and all those higher salaries don’t pay for themselves. To afford them, every school in the Wall Street Journal’s analysis increased tuition and fee revenue per student by double digits from 2002–2022:

At the University of Oklahoma, tuition and fees per student rose 166% in the two decades analyzed.

Penn State, the most expensive flagship state school, costs the average student nearly $27,000 a year.

Big picture: Schools are spending so much because there’s no one to stop them. Economist James V. Koch found that trustees approve 98% of cost-increasing proposals at large public universities, and Holden Thorp, former chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the WSJ that universities are just “devouring money.”—CC

If New York is dead, why is our rent so high? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azq?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Two headlines next to each other. One reads “New York City is dead forever” from The New York Post on August 17, 2020. The other reads “The average Manhattan rent just hit a new record of $5,588 a month” from MSNBC on August 10, 2023. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azq?mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> New York Post & MSNBC
It wasn’t just your LA friends—everyone thought the pandemic would officially kill New York City. But apparently, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger: The city’s rents have rebounded…and then some.

Average rents in Manhattan hit a record high <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azr?mblid=b492864863f0&mbcid=32365807.2954170&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of $5,588 in July, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. It’s also the fourth month of record-breaking prices in the last five months, according to CNBC.

During the pandemic-triggered remote work revolution, economists warned that workers would flee to more affordable states and devastate the city’s real estate market. But despite nearly 400,000 people leaving Manhattan between June 2020 and June 2022, the average rent for apartments in the borough is now 30% higher than it was in 2019.

What happened? For starters, there’s still not enough housing on the island. And soaring interest rates are making it a lot more expensive for people to buy, so they are being pushed back into the rental market, giving prices an even bigger lift. Plus, the cost of housing in the city typically climbs throughout the summer so, spoiler alert: This month will likely break records too.

Record rental prices show that people are choosing to live in Manhattan despite not going in to work there. Manhattan offices were only at 48% of capacity last month, according to Kastle Systems.—MM

The author says that Mickelson made 858 wagers of $220,000 and more than 1,100 wagers of $110,000 between 2010 and 2014. He even attempted to bet $400,000 on Team USA (which he was playing on) at the 2012 Ryder Cup.

The music genre that’s said to have begun at a back-to-school party in the Bronx is celebrating its 50th birthday this weekend.

Hip-hop has grown from a style of musical expression for young people living among poverty and crime to the most popular music genre in the US and a worldwide phenomenon whose influence can be seen in everything from a house party playlist to the courtside seats at a Brooklyn Nets game.

It’s a surprising economic force

Music history experts say that hip-hop’s impact on the $16 billion music industry is so extensive that it’s not easily quantifiable. But even Run-DMC—one of the most influential hip-hop groups in history—struggled in the genre’s early days. “Nobody involved in Bronx hip-hop made big money,” Fordham University history professor Mark Naison told the Associated Press. But in 1986, Run DMC released “My Adidas,” and then an endorsement deal followed…and everything changed.

Since then, Jay-Z, Sean Combs, and Dr. Dre are a few of the dominant players in hip-hop leveraged their celebrity status to start companies, build brands, and amass millions (or in the case of Jay-Z and Combs, billions) of dollars:

Dr. Dre sold Beats Electronics to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion. It’s Apple’s largest acquisition to date.

Some of Jay-Z’s most valuable assets are Armand de Brignac, a luxury champagne line, and his entertainment agency, Roc Nation.

Diddy, up until June, had a partnership with liquor company Diageo. He also founded Bad Boy Records, which was worth $100 million at its height, according to Insider.

Puma, Nike, and Reebok have partnerships with hip-hop stars Rihanna, Travis Scott, and Cardi B, respectively.

Late fashion designer Virgil Abloh found fame with his line Off-White, which gained popularity with hip-hop icons. Luxury conglomerate LVMH acquired 60% of Off-White in 2021.

Looking ahead…industry experts predict that the genre’s economic impact will only increase in the future as brands continue to explore relationships with musicians.—CC

Tour de headlines <#> An illustration of a TV with Disney+ on it Francis Scialabba
Disney’s streaming services are about to get pricier. The cost of ad-free versions are going up on October 12: Disney+ by 27% and Hulu by 20%, though in good news for cheapskates, the lowest-tier plans will stay the same. The House of Mouse revealed the price hikes after reporting mixed results <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awb?mblid=5ad903edc0f7&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the second quarter—including that it’s still losing subscribers (though most of those were from Disney+ Hotstar, which took a beating after losing cricket broadcast rights in India). Disney’s losses from streaming lessened last quarter, and the company is trying to make it profitable by September 2024.

Economic trouble alert from China. While most of the world is worried about inflation, China has the opposite issue: Consumer prices there fell 0.3% last month compared to 2022. Economists attribute the deflation to weak demand caused by record youth unemployment, an embattled housing market, and fewer exports. Chinese factories churned out an oversupply of products, making producer prices fall as well. That could help ease inflation in the US and Europe, but a prolonged slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy would spell trouble for global economic health. In another economic blow to China, President Biden signed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awc?mblid=02665b787811&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> an order yesterday restricting US investment in certain Chinese technology.

Special Counsel Jack Smith has been reading Trump’s Twitter.

Twitter was a major platform for Trump until he was kicked off the app in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” restored Trump’s account after he bought Twitter (now called X), but Trump has not tweeted since.

Hawaii is battling wind-swept wildfires <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wildfires burn in Hawaii <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awe?mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Senator Tim Richards/Facebook
Fires tearing through parts of Maui and Hawaii’s Big Island this week have killed at least six people, stranded thousands, and reduced much of a historic town to ash.

The Maui town of Lāhainā—a tourist destination and nationally recognized historical landmark—has been largely destroyed. Hundreds of families were displaced, and the US Coast Guard rescued at least 12 people who jumped into the ocean to escape the fire.

Meanwhile, Maui hospitals were inundated with injuries but not equipped for “extensive burn treatment,” according to Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, so some people have been airlifted to Oahu.

Sixty-mile-per-hour gusts partially due to a passing Category 4 hurricane fanned the blazes <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awf?mblid=302bd9d0c6ef&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, blocked roads, and grounded firefighting helicopters.

Downed cell towers have also left authorities reliant on satellite phones to communicate with people in scorched areas.

Hawaii is forecast to be at an above-average risk of wildfires through November, but fires were rare in the region before humans arrived—making them especially damaging when they do hit.

Now that space tourism is a thing, it can’t just be another Neil or Buzz when you send people barreling out into the atmosphere. So today, Virgin Galactic is sending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/awk?mblid=25a9f54553af&mbcid=32351752.2804707&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the first mother-daughter pair to space together on its second commercial flight.

The Galactic 02 mission, which will last about 70 minutes (just shy of a full viewing of March of the Penguins) and include a few minutes of zero gravity, is set to leave the New Mexico desert around 11am ET. And the lucky contest winner, Keisha Schahaff, is taking her daughter Anastatia Mayers as her  plus-one. They will also be the first people from the Caribbean to go to space.

Eighty-year-old Olympic canoeist Jon Goodwin will also be on the flight. He will be the first Olympian and second person with Parkinson’s disease to go to space.

Space is a vast business: For most of us, a contest is probably the most likely way to visit the stars. Tickets on a Virgin Galactic flight have reached as much as $450,000, which is pretty cheap compared to SpaceX’s $55 million and Blue Origin’s purported $28 million ticket prices.—MM

Though he’s unquestionably a star, Porter said he hasn’t made “f— you money” yet, and that both a new movie and a new television show he was set to be in were not happening because of the ongoing labor struggle. Referring to the anonymous studio exec who said the plan was to starve the strikers out, Porter made it clear that he’s plenty hungry.

Wegovy might do more than help people lose weight <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Wegovy packages <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atf?mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Picture Alliance/Getty Images
The hyped anti-obesity drug from Novo Nordisk was found to cut the risk <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atg?mblid=edec8e44bb10&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of major cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attacks, by a whopping 20%, the company announced yesterday.

These findings, which came from a late-stage clinical trial, are important for two reasons:

They show that Wegovy could be more than a lifestyle drug that helps people shed pounds. It also has considerable benefits for heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the US.

And, given those wider benefits, insurance companies and Medicare could feel pressured to start covering the popular, pricey medication, which many insurers have avoided since it wasn’t deemed essential to overall health. Wegovy costs over $1,300 per month for weekly injections.

The reaction:

“If they play baseball in Denmark, Wegovy just hit a home run,” Barclays analyst Emily Field wrote <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ath?mblid=dd0e579ce6dc&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, referencing Novo Nordisk’s Danish home base. (Just checked: They don’t seem to play much baseball in Denmark.)

Others went further, declaring these findings amounted to a grand slam <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ati?mblid=9e4f738cf101&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. The study means that Wegovy and a similar drug from Eli Lilly (Mounjaro) will easily become the “top-selling pharmaceuticals in history,” Barron’s gushed. And investors are betting they will be, too.

Novo Nordisk gained $60 billion <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atj?mblid=fe8070102da1&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in market cap yesterday to close in on luxury conglomerate LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, per Bloomberg.

Eli Lilly also got a big boost <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atk?mblid=cd78af55792f&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from its bullish earnings report and the Novo Nordisk results. Shares of the world’s largest healthcare company soared 15% to a record high yesterday.

Big picture: A new class of superdrug that significantly reduces weight, cuts the risk of heart attacks, and offers numerous other unexplored benefits (like curbing addiction <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74-?mblid=c35b004e94ab&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>) could herald an exciting new era for public health.

But don’t count your chickens, etc., etc….Supply has been constrained amid a celebrity-powered frenzy for these drugs, there can be serious side effects, and the most recent study showing cardiovascular benefits hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.—NF

WeWork said it could go bankrupt.

Americans are spending like they’re Isla Fisher in a 2009 rom-com. A new report <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/att?mblid=7f22d6f88d97&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that Americans charged more than ever to their credit cards last quarter, bringing credit card debt to over $1 trillion for the first time.

Booming credit card debt is the result of higher prices caused by inflation, rising interest rates, and strong consumer confidence, as well as 24 million new credit cards issued in the last quarter.

As debt has risen, so have late payments: The report found that in Q2, 7.2% of credit card accounts were 30 days overdue—the highest level in 11 years—and delinquency rates rose to 3.18% (up from 3%).

Yes, but…according to the Fed, neither of these numbers is shocking. Delinquency rates are returning to pre-pandemic levels after plummeting in 2020 when everyone collected stimulus checks and saved money.

Big picture: While $1 trillion in credit card debt seems alarming, economists are as unbothered as the guy holding up the line at Chipotle. Consumer debt is still just 6% of total deposits Americans have in their bank accounts, the lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atu?mblid=760832f5186b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> percentage in 20 years, per Axios.

Epic Games just approved a virtual Holocaust museum for its popular online video game Fortnite. It’s probably the last thing anyone would expect from the battle royale that lets users play as Optimus Prime and do a TikTok dance after 360-no-scoping a walking fish.

But the digital gallery’s designer, who also created the educational Holocaust game The Light in the Darkness, tweeted <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atz?mblid=7d04519187f7&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that this museum—existing separately from Fortnite’s main play—will be “game changing” for Holocaust awareness: Fortnite has about 239 million active monthly users, according to ActivePlayer, and 80% of Americans have never visited a Holocaust museum, according to a 2018 study.

Fortnite players who visit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atA?mblid=f55d01a9915c&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the Voices of The Forgotten Museum…

Can: Walk through exhibits resembling those found at in-person Holocaust museums, minus photos of dead bodies and concentration camps, which would violate the game’s age rating.

Cannot: Use weapons, break anything, or dance. Epic learned its lesson after players kept doing the floss and the robot at a 2021 in-game event <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atB?mblid=f1e6d0d6ad1b&mbcid=32339653.3176240&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.

Key performance indicators <#> Still from Oppenheimer Universal Pictures
Stat: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has become the highest-grossing film set during World War II in history, passing Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan with a $500+ million global box-office haul, CNN reports. Of course, if you adjust for inflation, Oppenheimer is still behind the other two movies, but that’s less fun. Anyway, question for the audience: Ignoring box-office revenues…what’s the best movie set during WWII? Inglourious Basterds? Schindler’s List?

Many fellow baseball announcers voiced their support for Brown and bashed the Orioles organization, which until this PR debacle was having a stellar season (they’re in first place in the AL East). The Orioles denied that a suspension took place and said, “We look forward to hearing Kevin’s voice soon.”

This news is for anyone who has long ignored the little “Crypto” icon at the bottom of their Venmo screen. Yesterday, PayPal debuted its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), the first stablecoin to be issued by a global financial platform.

So…what is stablecoin? It’s a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, in this case the US dollar, which is meant to make it less volatile and safer than other tokens. Stablecoins have been around for decades but haven’t taken off in the consumer payment space—largely because regulators aren’t sold on that stability promise.

PayPal asserts that PYUSD will “reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments” and allow for faster and cheaper transfers between countries.

PYUSD works for peer-to-peer payments, both for checking out online or transferring value among digital wallets.

The currency is redeemable for dollars and is convertible to or from other digital currencies that PayPal supports.

And soon, you’ll be able to send your tokens between PayPal and Venmo, making it even more convenient to send Karl $50 for dinner and drinks.

The future of digital payments

Regulatory smackdowns have cast a shadow over crypto for the last year. PYUSD is issued by Paxos Trust Co., which previously issued the Binance stablecoin, BUSD, until that one was shut down by regulators earlier this year for…being involved with Binance.

But with PayPal—a mainstream fintech company—entering the scene, Paxos sees a “watershed moment” in stablecoin regulation coming. Congress is also currently sitting on two bills—one about the broader crypto industry and one that is specific to stablecoins—that could have a huge impact on what happens next.

What’s in it for PayPal? Besides keeping it at the cutting edge of payment tech, there’s a profit potential. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, could be on track to bring in $6 billion in revenue this year.—CC

Tesla’s CFO stepped down.

Still, the unexpected departure spooked investors, raising concerns about volatility in the company’s executive ranks and succession planning to one day replace Musk at the top.

The deal comes less than a year after a federal judge kiboshed a plan to sell Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House for ~2.2 billion on antitrust grounds, ruling that deal would financially harm authors after a trial in which Stephen King testified against it. Rather than appeal, Paramount decided to search for a new buyer and received a $200 million fee from Random House since the deal failed to go through.

Freeway traffic won’t be the only thing grinding to a halt in Los Angeles today. More than 11,000 city workers <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aps?mblid=982a23e4177f&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> plan to walk off the job this morning for 24 hours.

Sanitation and airport workers fed up with a lack of resources and unfilled vacancies will be among those participating, according to the SEIU Local 721, which represents many city workers.

This comes as Hot Strike Summer has been extra scorching in LA. The city workers will be joining:

170,000 Hollywood actors and 12,500 screenwriters picketing there and in NYC.

Thousands of local hotel workers staging rolling strikes, who even tried to get Taylor Swift to postpone LA tour dates.

Nationwide, strikes have spiked this summer, putting July among the busiest months for labor action in decades, according to the Washington Post.

Turns out Classics majors and petroleum-engineering students have more in common than we thought: Their programs are shrinking. College students just aren’t interested in entering <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apy?mblid=b31f31d7b6cb&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the oil and gas industry like they used to be, no matter how much money they are set to make when they graduate, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The number of undergrads studying petroleum engineering—once a practical, popular major that would make Boomer parents proud—has seen a 75% decline since 2014, Texas Tech professor Lloyd Heinze told the WSJ.

In the past, enrollment in oil- and gas-related majors followed the market, but despite oil prices popping off between 2016 and 2021, the number grads entering the field still fell, according to the US Dept. of Education. It probably didn’t help that the pandemic highlighted how volatile the oil and gas industry could be as companies laid off over 100,000 <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apz?mblid=1c47df17fa6d&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> employees between March and August 2020.

It’s not just about business. Post-graduation, petroleum engineers can earn 40% more than computer science grads, but Gen Z are opting for more environmentally conscious companies and roles. Current students are nervous about the fossil fuel industry’s role in climate change and if these high-paying jobs will even exist in the future as the country moves towards clean energy.—MM

Stat: Few things scare billionaires—they’re constantly vying to send themselves to space or even fight each other in a cage—but one thing that probably does strike fear into a titan of industry’s heart is learning that Nate Anderson’s firm, Hindenburg Research, is writing about their companies. According to Bloomberg, the prominent short-seller <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/apD?mblid=c82585b3b721&mbcid=32325826.2779332&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> shaved $99 billion from the combined wealth of Gautam Adani, Jack Dorsey, and Carl Icahn this year and caused the value of public companies they own to plunge by $173 billion, despite all the companies denying the claims against them.

Good morning. It boggles the mind of a Northeasterner who’s used to a post-Labor Day start, but apparently many kids across the US will return for the first day of school this morning.

Of course, they’ll have an earlier start to the summer than we did. So here’s a question: Would you rather be in school for most of August but out by Memorial Day? Or have August free but sit in class through June ?

What just happened to college football? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Oregon and Washington football players line up <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alS?mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Tom Hauck/Getty Images
Over the past few days, college football has undergone a shake-up that further obliterated traditional geographic rivalries, left a once-proud conference on its deathbed, and cemented the formation of a handful of national superconferences—all in the pursuit of TV riches <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alT?mblid=3193b1c779ba&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>.

The moves reflect the inevitable professionalization of college football, one of the only university athletic products that can command billions of dollars for television broadcast rights.

Here’s what went down:

Oregon and Washington defected <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alU?mblid=97b1055b7978&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> from the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, joining their West Coast peers USC and UCLA in the once-Midwestern-focused conference that will soon have 18 teams from coast to coast.

Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah said they would also leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, a decision Colorado made two weeks ago.

The 108-year-old Pac-12 is teetering on the verge of collapse with just four schools remaining: Stanford, Cal, Oregon State, and Washington State.

If you hate this, blame TV

The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference (SEC) have recently secured mega TV deals that will pay their members handsomely…and the Pac-12 has not. It’s that simple.

The SEC inked a $3 billion deal for 10 years with Disney beginning in 2024, while the Big Ten reached a mammoth agreement with Fox, CBS, and NBC worth up to $7.5 billion over seven years. The Pac-12 has been trying to strike a deal with Apple TV+ to stream its games, but the potential payout for schools was not enough to stop the exodus.

The Big Ten sent $58 million to each of its schools during the 2021–22 fiscal year, according to tax records, and that number will only grow under its new TV deal.

Under the Apple deal, Pac-12 members would receive $30 million…on the high end of the range.

Big picture: “The old question—how long would it take TV money to destroy college football? Maybe we’re here. Maybe we’re here,” the head football coach at Washington State mused last Thursday. And whether or not you agree that conference realignment has “destroyed” college football, it has certainly dismantled the regional distinctiveness of each conference that gave the sport its magic.

The USWNT is going home from the World Cup. No country has ever won back-to-back-to-back World Cup trophies, and it’s going to stay that way since the US Women’s National Team lost a heartbreaker <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alY?mblid=8f4f868e4bd1&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to Sweden in a penalty shootout yesterday (by one millimeter <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alZ?mblid=4b627e275a8a&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>!). Coming ahead of the quarterfinal round, it was the US women’s earliest exit from a World Cup ever. The next chance for some hardware isn’t far away—the Paris Olympics are next summer—but the once-dominant USWNT has found that its international peers are catching up to its quality.

Barbie hits $1 billion.

Barbie is also the fastest-selling movie in the 100-year history of Warner Bros., reaching 10 figures after just 17 days in theaters. And the momentum isn’t slowing down: Barbie held its spot as the No. 1 movie in North America for the third straight weekend.

Musk and Zuckerberg fought over their fight.

Over on rival app Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shot back, “Shouldn’t we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?” and claimed that Musk “hasn’t confirmed” the Aug. 26 date Zuck floated. “I’m not holding my breath,” Zuck said.

RIP fully remote work: 2020–2023. You lived a beautiful life that left an imprint on couches everywhere.

The cause of death? Videoconferencing software company Zoom has told employees within a 50-mile radius of one of its offices that they must come in <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am1?mblid=48b26b51f92d&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at least two days a week, Insider reported.

Zoom, of course, was the poster child for remote work during the pandemic, emerging from obscurity to become the go-to video platform for work meetings and awkward virtual happy hours. So, I don’t need to explain the symbolism of Zoom telling its employees to return to the physical office to describe how CEOs think fully remote work is going for them.

The increased hostility toward WFH from executives certainly hasn’t been good for Zoom stock. After soaring more than 6x during the pandemic, Zoom has lost more than $100 billion in market value since its peak, per Insider.

Google’s trying a different strategy to lure workers back

A cheap hotel stay. The tech giant is offering its employees a sweetheart deal to check in to the Google-owned hotel <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am2?mblid=0f2f70059378&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> on its Mountain View campus for $99 a night, CNBC reported, hoping that a breezy commute will attract more Googlers to code in person.

This “Summer Special” does not fall under approved business travel, so the hotel stays will come out of employees’ pockets. Still, workers have been doing the math…and $99/night comes out to about $3,000/month, which is less than many of them pay for rent in Silicon Valley. Plus, someone makes your bed.

Key performance indicators <#> Chart showing how much people pay for their cars per month across the US Edmunds
Stat: Last quarter, in truck-lovin’ states Texas and Wyoming, more than 25% of car shoppers committed to a payment of more than $1,000 per month <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am7?mblid=cac1b253d88b&mbcid=32314388.2772861&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, according to Edmunds. Across the country, the share of car buyers who financed a vehicle with a monthly payment of at least $1,000 jumped to a record 17.1% in Q2 (in 2019, it was just 4.3%). Higher auto prices and borrowing rates are making buying a vehicle a major expense for households.

**Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends August 31, 2023.

  SCIENCE

  Dept. of Progress <#> Dexter from Dexter's lab saying Dexter’s Laboratory/Warner Bros. Domestic Television via Giphy Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even pop some bubbly.

Scientists climb cathedrals to collect space dust. Old churches preserve more than just architectural history: Their spired roofs are an untouched oasis of asteroid and comet particles, and two scientists are going, as The Guardian put it, Ghostbusters-mode to gather samples. Equipped with harnesses and vacuum backpacks, Penny Wozniakiewicz and Matthias van Ginneken plan to scale cathedrals across the UK to gather the cosmic dust lying atop. They’re trying to understand how heavily the space objects that melt into particles en route to Earth layer our surfaces. They say cathedrals <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajS?mblid=24e58d4ca294&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> are especially useful because they tend to have good construction records showing how long the roofs have been there, collecting dust.

Are you very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy? That’s the question that the General Social Survey has asked a sample of US adults since 1972. A new analysis of people’s answers shows we’re all doing…okay. There’s been a dip in happiness <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajT?mblid=79d886c45a4c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> since about the turn of the century, but satisfaction has started to turn around. However, not everyone is equally happy: Married people tend to be 30% happier than unmarried folks, people who trust others (or the government) are happier than people who sleep with one eye open, and the Northeast is the unhappiest region. And women, but not men, have reported declining happiness for the past 50 years.

Size matters for keeping champagne fizzy. A 3-liter bottle of bubbly is predicted to last for 132 years before going flat—more than three times the shelf life of a 750-milliliter champagne bottle, according to a new study. A French physicist studying champagne <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajU?mblid=687012d36d13&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne analyzed the aging process of 13 vintage collections. He and his team found that after champagne’s necessary aging period, all the bottles lost carbonation the longer they sat on the shelf, but the larger the bottles were, the more fizz they retained. So, the next time you buy old champagne, the research suggests you should spring for a jeroboam.—ML

  NEWS ANALYSIS

  Why everyone is trying to cook up a superconductor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajV?mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Mad scientist <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajV?mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>Alina555/Getty Images Lab researchers, amateur lab researchers, and an X user with an anime profile pic have all spent the last week trying to get metal to levitate.

It’s not some new-age occult ritual: The ability to float over a magnet is characteristic of a substance conveying electricity without any resistance, aka a superconductor. Ever since South Korean researchers claimed they discovered <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9Rv?mblid=8834decb5857&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a superconductor that could work outside of extreme conditions—long considered the Holy Grail of physics—other scientists have rushed to verify their findings. Meanwhile, social media has been abuzz as hobbyists try to synthesize the so-called “LK-99” substance at home and publish their DIY experiments online.

Why are normies suddenly obsessed with solid-state physics?

Existing superconductors are impractical for most real-world uses since they can only function at super-low temperatures or under extremely high pressure. Finding one that works in ambient-pressure, room-temp conditions is a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement that would be as game-changing as TV headphones were for your grandparents’ marriage.

Because superconductors can boost any tech that relies on electricity or magnets, a commercially viable one could enable <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajW?mblid=00eb73aa34ac&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> futuristic developments like ubiquitous floating maglev trains, 100% energy-efficient grids, and commercially viable quantum computers.

That’s why everyone’s so hyped over the Seoul-based scientists’ two preliminary papers and video <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajX?mblid=ed7c6199e102&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the ostensibly floating substance, LK-99. It’s already started to affect markets in Asia and the US, briefly rallying stocks of obscure companies that could benefit from a superconductor revolution. But, before the scientific community breaks into a Windows 95-launch nerd dance <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajY?mblid=4825f474d7ab&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, other experts have to review the methods and data in the paper and replicate the experiment to ensure it’s not a fluke.

The race to replicate is on

At least 12 academic labs on four continents are publicly working to synthesize the supposedly superconductive material, according to one blogger <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ajZ?mblid=1aeb105c158c&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> who’s been tracking the progress.

US-based Lawrence Berkeley National Lab <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj-?mblid=d21626a71834&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and China’s Shenyang National Laboratory <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aj_?mblid=1e34449d75d3&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, as well as other labs, published tentative findings indicating that there’s a chance that the substance is indeed a superconductor.

And since the original experiment involved a mix of easy-to-procure ingredients and pretty straightforward techniques, DIYers are also getting in on the act and making LK-99 the internet’s main character.

* A Moscow-based condensed matter physics enthusiast with an anime avatar, @iris_IGB <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak0?mblid=1b92d70c1671&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, posted purported photo evidence <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak1?mblid=073921b2be18&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of achieving LK-99 levitation. She claims concocting the superconducting substance using her modified method cost her around $160.

* An engineer working at a California space startup, Andrew McCalip, has been spending <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak2?mblid=9ddb2780b651&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> a lot of time trying to cook up the floating metal and tweeting his progress.

* Levitating LK-99 became a side project for French chemistry PhD student Ezzoubair Bendadesse who (according to his unverified X account) so far has failed twice but managed <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak3?mblid=7f088a60832d&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to produce a “reddish pellet.”

But most physicists are casting doubt on LK-99

Despite the internet’s enthusiasm, skepticism has been the prevailing sentiment among most experts. Material scientists are well aware that erroneous superconductor “breakthroughs” have happened before. There’s even a term for such “discoveries”: USOs (unidentified superconducting objects). 

A committee organized by the Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics said the researchers from Seoul did not provide enough evidence to conclude that the substance is really a room-temperature superconductor. They asked to review a sample of the substance.

Argonne National Laboratory theorist Michael Norman has questioned the expertise of the same researchers. He told Science Magazine that parts of their data seem “fishy” and that he’s doubtful about how exactly LK-99 can work, pointing out that superconducting is puzzlingly uncharacteristic of some of the ingredients in the metal alloy.

Looking ahead...we’ll have to wait and see whether LK-99 can be verified, but some think the fact that this saga is playing out so publicly is already a win for the scientific method. Maybe the real ambient superconductor is the lab partners we made along the way.—SK

  Place to be: A show biz hangout in LA <#> A bartender serves a drink at Residuals Tavern Residuals Tavern It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process.

Welcome to Residuals Tavern, where a $0.50 check will get you a beer on the house.

As its name suggests, this Studio City bar is a reference to the royalty checks known as “residuals” Hollywood performers receive when the shows or movies they worked on get optioned for reruns. In the boom years of the ’90s, residual checks could run into the hundreds of dollars. But in the streaming era, many payouts have shrunk to less than $1—a central reason why actors and writers have gone on strike.

Since it opened in 1986, Residuals Tavern, a show biz hangout near the studio lots of Walt Disney, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures, has offered a free beer <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/akg?mblid=a92033ce7674&mbcid=32301118.3092364&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to anyone who showed up with a residual check of less than $1, Reuters reports. The bar even used to put the laughably small checks up on the wall as a metaphorical middle finger to the studios.

**Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management.

It’s raining Tupperware on the New York Stock Exchange like someone just flung open the kitchen cabinets.

The plastic container brand revealed back in April that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the stock still smelled fresh to day traders who sniff out the market’s leftovers. And the traders’ strategy is starting to look more airtight after shares reached a nine-month high yesterday following Tupperware’s announcement of a deal with lenders to restructure its debt and secure $21 million in new financing.

How Tupperware’s value got preserved

After a pandemic-era boom in sales ended, the 77-year-old enabler of we-have-food-at-home families stumbled <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al8?mblid=80ee4320b57f&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, and Tupperware Brands was warned in June that the NYSE might delist it because of its low value and sub-$1 stock price.

But last month, penny stock savants started snapping up the company’s shares, and BlackRock  also stepped in to catch <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al9?mblid=647faa95bad9&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the falling containers as an investment partner. Tupperware’s stock has since soared to around $5—still low, but offering meteoric returns for people who bought in last month at its 61-cent low.

But Tupperware might be more than a meme stock. Some analysts say <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ala?mblid=e6f842eef522&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the container company’s rebound looks less like the internet-fueled spike in AMC and GameStop’s stocks, and more like another risky recent phenomenon: a bankrupt stock buy-up.

Notable examples include…

Transportation company Yellow Corp., which shut down operations last weekend…and then saw its stock soar by roughly 350% between Monday and Friday amid reports of a bankruptcy loan.

Hertz, the rental car company that enjoyed a 900% stock rally in the two weeks following its 2020 bankruptcy filing. It emerged from bankruptcy with a deal that paid off its debts and paid out to stockholders.

Early days: For Tupperware to mount a full comeback, it would have to confront the reason its stock (and its sales) started sliding in the first place: competitors like Pyrex and Rubbermaid.—ML

Pill for postpartum depression approved. Yesterday, the FDA signed off on the first pill <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alJ?mblid=706abf2f5ccb&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for postpartum depression, a condition that affects one in eight mothers after giving birth. Sage Therapeutics and Biogen plan to start selling the pill in the US under the brand name Zurzuvae by the end of the year, after the Drug Enforcement Administration completes its review. Sage already has a postpartum depression treatment on the market, but it’s an infusion given continuously over two days, making it much less convenient for parents wrangling newborns than the new pill, which should be taken daily for two weeks.

Bots are usually the last thing you want to encounter on a dating app while swiping through endless photos of people standing atop mountains, but Tinder is preparing to harness the power of AI <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alf?mblid=445c83de380d&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> for the good of your profile.

The app, which already uses artificial intelligence in its matching algorithms, has started testing new customer-facing tools. One sifts through your photos and selects the best five to display (hopefully with the good sense to avoid the ambiguous group shot), addressing a pain point where many users get flustered in building their profile.

It’s just the beginning of the AI dating revolution. Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, which also owns Hinge and OKCupid, revealed plans in its recent earnings announcement to integrate new AI features across its brands, not just to help build profiles but also to highlight why someone may be a good match.

And the company can’t control whether daters bring AI into the mix themselves: A recent UK study found that over 50% of single men would use chatbots to help chat up potential dates.

What began in 2017 as ten hours of fun games on TV to fill time—inspired by a running gag in the 2004 critically acclaimed film Dodgeball—is now a 43-hour extravaganza that kicked off Thursday and concludes today. And it has turned into *motions to a grown man playing tag* one of the major sporting events of the season, with roughly half of the games being broadcast live from “Ocho-ville <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alm?mblid=a9fb09d7b636&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>” (Rock Hill, South Carolina) with actual fans in attendance.

It looks like Mark Zuckerberg has been following the Silicon Valley playbook of asking for forgiveness rather than permission in his personal life as well as his business. The Facebook founder recently posted screenshots <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al2?mblid=5aebb94e0786&mbcid=32304874.2788385&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of a text exchange with his wife, Priscilla Chan, where he asks her whether she had seen the MMA octagon he’d installed in their backyard. And unlike the internet, which has been cheering on Zuck’s possible fight with Elon Musk and admiring his efforts to get shredded, she was…not amused.

TRAVEL

Airlines are dropping prices to keep you in the US <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Illustration of Earth with lots of planes crisscrossing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahf?mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Francis Scialabba
Travel within the US is down this summer, and airlines are slashing prices in the hopes that a $60 ticket will be cheap enough to convince you to visit Cleveland.

Earlier this week, US-focused JetBlue cut its earnings forecast for the year and warned of a loss in Q3. Other primarily domestic airlines are also experiencing turbulence:

Alaska Airlines has slashed fares, while Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier held flight promotions <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahg?mblid=687a4940feaa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> this summer—a sign of struggle within the industry.

US round-trip fares are down 11% compared to 2022 and 2019, according to Hopper.com.

Meanwhile…American Airlines, Delta, and United—all carriers with global operations—have exceeded expectations and kept prices high. International airfare is averaging $962, up 10% from last year and 26% from 2019, per Hopper.

Bucket list trips > sand bucket trips

Why are people traveling outside the US? It’s not exactly a mystery: Americans who were stuck in the country for nearly two years are ready to put their Duolingo streak to the ultimate test. Mastercard said that spending linked to overseas travel is currently at 154% of pre-pandemic levels.

So…where is everyone?

Predictably, a lot of Americans are in Europe <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahh?mblid=bbb5d5328e0b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. According to Allianz, the number of Americans traveling to Europe this year will be 55% more than last summer, with London, Paris, Dublin, and Rome as the top destinations.

Travel to Pacific countries, including China and Japan, has also popped off. American Airlines said passenger revenue for trans-Pacific routes has more than tripled in the first half of the year.

All the international travel has left American attractions feeling a little empty inside. Major theme parks, including Disney World, Universal, Six Flags, and SeaWorld, have all reported lower-than-usual attendance rates this summer.—CC

As he’s responded to his previous two indictments, Trump pleaded not guilty.

Start preparing for an onslaught of gas-pump pics on social media with the caption, “Thanks, Biden!” The national average of gas rose to a nine-month high of $3.82 per gallon yesterday, up 11 cents from a week ago, per AAA.

So, what’s driving prices higher? A noxious mix of heat and geopolitics.

The heat: It was so hot in July that refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, which aren’t designed for temps over 95 degrees, are struggling to produce gasoline. That, paired with increased demand for fuel over the summer (so many late-night drives blaring Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive”), means gasoline inventories in the country have fallen to their lowest <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahq?mblid=93cdaafb1b30&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> July level since 2015.

The geopolitics: Major oil producer Saudi Arabia said yesterday it would extend <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahr?mblid=a1c22288183b&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> its output cuts into September and could even deepen those cuts after that, according to state media. By curbing supply, Saudi Arabia hopes to prop up the price of oil—which gives it critical revenue to spend on futuristic cities and Ronaldo’s teammates. But the cuts are angering the White House because they could lead to an uptick in US inflation.

Looking ahead...the rise in gas prices may not last. Refinery operations are returning <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahs?mblid=9359c24e54aa&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to normal, and demand usually tapers off in August, according to an AAA spokesperson.

Lizzo fans fell to their knees this week upon hearing that she’s being sued by three former dancers for the type of alleged mistreatment she’s known for standing against.

And like most celebrities who suddenly find themselves on the verge of getting canceled, the “Truth Hurts” singer posted a Notes App “apology” on Instagram and X yesterday in which she called the accusations “false” and “as unbelievable as they sound.”

The lawsuit alleges <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaS?mblid=d59cb60062de&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that between May 2021 and May 2023…

Lizzo pressured dancers into interacting with nude performers at an Amsterdam club.

Lizzo’s dance captain pushed religious beliefs on the other dancers and publicly fixated on one plaintiff’s abstinence.

Members of the dance cast, described as “full-figured women of color” in the suit, were scolded when they asked for better compensation for tour downtime.

An “excruciating” rehearsal left one plaintiff so fearful of being let go for underperforming that she soiled herself rather than take a bathroom break. She says she was later fired for recording a meeting, and that Lizzo’s security team didn’t let her leave until they searched her phone for the video.

Since the lawsuit was announced, three more women who used to work with Lizzo have said <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahx?mblid=ab700f8200bd&mbcid=32291768.2790141&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> they had similar experiences with the singer…but Lizzo maintains the allegations are just “sensationalized stories.”—ML

Everyone who warned about a recession last year <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adO?mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Homer Simpson disappearing into a hedge. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adO?mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> The Simpsons/20th Television via Giphy
By now, we’re all about as desensitized to recession talk as to the prophecies of a doomsday cult. And we may be right: Yesterday, Bank of America’s economists became the first at a major Wall Street Bank to reverse <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adP?mblid=9f5551f4d0d1&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> their earlier prediction, saying there won’t be a recession in the next year.

Less than a year ago, just about everyone was forecasting an imminent recession. The Bloomberg Economics probability model suggested there was a 100% <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9EX?mblid=6e14c297563a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> chance the US would be plunged into a recession in the next year. And back in June 2022, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adQ?mblid=65d662588b14&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> investors to brace for an impending economic “hurricane.”

BofA pointed to solid consumer spending and inflation cooling to 3% last month. And its economists noted that, despite the Fed’s string of interest rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong with unemployment rates staying low (just 3.6% in June) and companies slowly hiring.

It’s not just BofA seeing clear skies ahead

Even as it raised interest rates again last week, the Federal Reserve said that it’s expecting a recession-free 2023. And Goldman Sachs cut the odds of recession in the next year from 25% to 20%.

CEOs in Q2 earnings calls were also feeling hopeful. The phrase “soft landing <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adR?mblid=d71572ab5e1a&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>,” the term for the Fed managing totackle inflation without tanking the economy, has been mentioned during earnings calls 97% more this cycle than in the last one.

Execs’ comments ranged from PNC CEO Bill Demchak’s “I think the soft landing feels right” to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s “I don’t know what the hell was going on.”

Even JPMorgan’s Dimon refrained from natural disaster metaphors and instead said the US consumer was currently in good shape.

Not everyone feels the same. The rosier predictions have made the timing of ratings agency Fitch’s decision to downgrade the US’ credit rating this week over political polarization awkward (Dimon called it ridiculous). But the New York Times pointed out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adS?mblid=76cc8344d88c&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that economists also made high-profile soft landing predictions right before recessions in 1990, 2000, and 2008.—MM

Tree of Life Synagogue Shooter sentenced to death. Yesterday, a federal jury concluded <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aek?mblid=614f8c8bb250&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that Robert Bowers, who killed 11 people at the Pittsburgh synagogue during Sabbath morning services, should be given the death penalty. The 2018 shooting was the deadliest antisemitic attack ever perpetrated in the US. The same jury in May convicted Bowers of 63 criminal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. A judge will formally hand down the sentence today.

Warner Brothers apologized for Barbenheimer posts. The internet is so obsessed with mashing up the two big movies of summer that it helped boost ticket sales for both Barbie and Oppenheimer, but there’s one place people are not amused: Japan. After US social media accounts for Warner Brothers’ doll movie acknowledged the memes, Japanese social media users expressed their displeasure with seeing the national tragedy of the atomic bomb as part of a joke, and the company’s Japanese arm called on its US parent to take action. In response, the US company issued an apology <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ael?mblid=a18ef3b81b09&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and deleted its posts.

Amazon has begun the largest overhaul of its grocery business since planting a flag in a Whole Foods papaya six years ago.

The revamp comes after the tech giant has struggled to work its usual industry-reinventing magic on grocery sales.

Now, under the guidance of former Whole Foods and Tesco executives, the online purveyor of every product ever is launching new strategies <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adX?mblid=0c0d5f5670cd&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to beef up its in-person stores and grow its share of the $1.5 trillion US grocery market, which is dominated by Walmart and Kroger. The big changes:

Amazon Fresh delivery is now available to non-Prime members in a dozen cities, with plans to expand nationwide by year’s end.

To make Amazon Fresh stores feel more…human…the redesigned supermarkets will feature brighter colors, Krispy Kreme stands by the front door, and self-checkout lanes to supplement its E-ZPass-esque “Just Walk Out” system.

Online, the shopping carts for Amazon Fresh, Amazon.com, and Whole Foods will merge into one, eliminating the need for separate checkouts.

Jamaica’s crowdfunding journey to the knockout stage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adE?mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Jamaica’s women’s team celebrating at the end of a game <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adE?mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> DeFodi Images/Getty Images
Yesterday, the Jamaican women’s national team danced to “One Love” to celebrate what seemed an unlikely achievement just months ago: drawing with Brazil to advance to the knockout stage <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adF?mblid=3f2792ae2c22&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of the World Cup.

Throw it back to April: To get the resources they needed to make it to the tournament, the self-styled Reggae Girlz were forced to throw it to the fans with crowdfunding campaigns.

In an Instagram post <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/adG?mblid=29bc9f036238&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>, players complained that the Jamaica Football Federation, which was struggling to find funding to send them to the World Cup, was providing “subpar planning, transportation, accommodations, training conditions,” and more. But the lack of support from the JFF led to a flood of support from elsewhere: A pair of crowdfunding campaigns has collectively raised over $100,000 for travel expenses, training, and the team’s staff.

One notable supporter is Cedella Marley—Bob Marley’s daughter—who has helped to keep the team afloat in the past after it was disbanded by JFF for…lack of funding.

Key performance indicators <#> Lake Lanier Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images
Stat: We’ve got a story for you to tell around your campfire: the tale of Georgia’s haunted lake. Lake Sidney Lanier, about an hour outside Atlanta supplies drinking water for ~5 million people, but it also seems cursed: 216 people died <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aen?mblid=fe10017e06fd&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in incidents on the lake between 1994 and 2022, while a nearby lake has just as many annual visitors and a third of the deaths, per the Washington Post. It could be because the lake was built over an old burial ground—it was cheaper to fill the manmade lake on top of the roads, homes, and, yes, cemeteries in the area than to demolish them first, according to Oxford American.

The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial, but in response to the indictment accusing former President Donald Trump of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election, his lawyer is saying no thanks <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ae1?mblid=64314a79fbd5&mbcid=32279218.2777773&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to that. Attorney John Lauro noted that the quick trial the government is pushing for would land solidly during election season, and that the 2024 hopeful shouldn’t be sitting in a courtroom “instead of debating the issues against Joe Biden.” Trump is expected in court today for an arraignment.

Good morning. Former President Trump was indicted yesterday on federal charges over his efforts to subvert American democracy and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. It’s the third indictment brought against Trump, who now faces a total of 78 criminal counts and a $40+ million (and growing) legal bill.

Trump said he was innocent and has vowed to continue his campaign to retake the White House. On Monday, a New York Times/Siena College poll found that he was demolishing the field for the Republican nomination, leading second-place Ron DeSantis 54% to 17%.

A story about a former federal agent on a mission to save a child from sex traffickers in the Colombia jungle has made more money at the box office than Tom Cruise battling an omnipotent AI superbeing.

With an estimated budget of $14.6 million and zero A-list talent, Sound of Freedom <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aao?mblid=739cfa54a0dd&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> has raked in over $149 million in the US and Canada since its July Fourth premiere, putting it ahead of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and not far behind the latest Indiana Jones movie. And the two Hollywood heavy hitters had budgets of $291 million and $294.7 million, respectively. 

Why the resounding success?

An unconventional marketing strategy is fueling sales: The lead actor, Jim Caviezel, appears on screen after the movie ends and urges viewers to “pay it forward” by buying tickets for others. More than 20% of opening-day tickets were purchased in response to this method, bringing in $2.6 million. A decent critical reception <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aap?mblid=7fea97c9713b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> also helped (though some experts have criticized <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaq?mblid=54f32a09f70b&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the film for misrepresenting aspects of real-life human trafficking).

But, perhaps even more importantly, Sound of Freedom’s focus on children’s issues and its Christian themes have made it particularly popular among conservatives.

Former President Trump screened it for political allies at his private club in New Jersey, and GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy held a viewing event for a group of lawmakers.

It’s also reportedly been embraced by QAnon conspiracy theorists who believe that liberal elites are running a child sex trafficking ring.

The film itself has become a subject of conspiracy theories. Some viewers have claimed that theaters sabotaged screenings through nefarious tactics like withholding A/C. AMC Theaters CEO Adam Aron called allegations that the chain is suppressing viewership for Sound of Freedom “bizarre,” pointing out <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aar?mblid=5fa42fff97b1&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> that the movie is available at 570 of its locations.—SK

The last time the US received a credit downgrade was in 2011, when S&P sent it to AA+, causing market mayhem. Past and present US economic officials said Fitch was off its rocker for the decision. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called it “bizarre and inept” given the current strength of the US economy.

The family of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells underpin much of modern medicine, reached a settlement <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaz?mblid=e19444b6ba5c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday with biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Lacks’s descendants filed a lawsuit <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaA?mblid=c8ca21421f47&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> against Thermo Fisher in 2021, claiming that the company profited off of Lacks’s cells for decades by selling her cells and seeking to obtain IP rights to medical advancements that they were used to develop.

It’s a remarkable, and painful, story. Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. While receiving treatment at Johns Hopkins, Lacks’s cells were harvested without her knowledge or consent. When researchers observed her cells in the lab, they found something surprising: They multiplied, whereas others would die within days. Scientists dubbed the line of identical cells “HeLa,” after Lacks’s name, and have used it for a variety <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaB?mblid=fea7f06a7c43&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> of medical advancements you’ve likely benefited from. According to the World Health Organization, HeLa cells were used:

In developing vaccines for polio, HPV, the flu, and Covid-19.

To study different types of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as IVF.

Zoom out: The settlement terms are confidential, but Lacks’s family has used the lawsuit to call attention to racism in the American medical system, saying in their complaint, “Too often, the history of medical experimentation in the United States has been the history of medical racism.”

Bed Bath & Beyond, which filed for bankruptcy in April, came back online <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaH?mblid=fac5611d3431&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday after its buyer, Overstock.com, pulled a Kirby and rebranded itself as…Bed Bath & Beyond.

The backstory: In June, Overstock picked through BB&B’s carcass and bought its name, some of its assets, and its long list of customer info for $21.5 million—but not any of its physical locations. Overstock, a former online liquidator, was hunting for a rebrand to market itself differently to customers, so it’s hoping that slapping the iconic BB&B name on its site and products will set it up for success.

But sometimes, a recognizable name is not enough. Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), a company created by sentient LinkedIn post Tai Lopez and Zoosk founder Alex Mehr, has also tried to resurrect collapsed brick-and-mortar brands. They’ve spent about $120 million since 2019 acquiring defunct retailers and attempting to bring them back to life online.

It’s gone…not well. REV has let its websites for brands like Linens ‘N Things and Modell’s fall into disrepair with sparse (if any) product listings. It even tried (and failed) to flip RadioShack into a crypto exchange in 2021. The WSJ reported <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaI?mblid=68f6b90e657c&mbcid=32266922.2817768&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in March that the group was looking into “restructuring options,” while REV acknowledged it would pause debt payments.

Overstock Bed Bath & Beyond will try to avoid the same mistakes. It’s planning to revive the customer loyalty its namesake once had and aims to release a wedding registry by next summer.—MM

MrBeast Burger became a ghost-kitchen phenomenon during the pandemic, selling 1 million burgers in its first three months. But eventually, people realized that the burgers were…horrible. In the suit, Donaldson cited customer complaints that the patties were “revolting” and “disgusting.”

Millions of Americans dreading the post-pandemic re-up of federal student loan payments in October could find major relief in a new program launched <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7J?mblid=32541a36d83d&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday by the Department of Education—if it can survive likely legal challenges.

Beginning this fall under the SAVE Plan…

One million more Americans will qualify for $0 monthly payments, the Department of Education estimates. The SAVE Plan raises the income threshold for paying nothing to $32,805, up from $22,000 or less under current income-driven repayment programs.

Unpaid interest will not pile up as long as people make their monthly payments, even if that monthly payment gets cut to $0.

And, beginning in July 2024…

Loans of $12,000 or less will be canceled after 10 years of payments (including loans taken out before 2024). Every additional $1,000 that’s borrowed beyond that would extend cancellation by another year, so a $22,000 loan would get canceled after 20 years of payments.

Undergraduate loan payments will be capped at 5% of borrowers’ discretionary funds—total income minus $32,800—down from 10% under current programs.

Potential legal attack inbound: The SAVE Plan is estimated to cost between $138 billion and $361 billion over 10 years, but first it might get hit with the kinds of lawsuits that sank <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7L?mblid=cb6888604d07&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Biden’s $400 billion loan forgiveness program.

A net 51% of banks said they’d raised their standards for large- and medium-sized business loans last, up from 46% during Q1 and the highest since 2008 (not counting the pandemic). For consumer loans, more banks than last quarter said they had upped credit card loan standards, but not as many banks tightened auto loan standards. Banks expect standards to keep getting tighter, with most reporting they’ll continue to make them tougher across loan categories.

Homer Simpson’s expertise is wanted down South: Georgia’s Plant Vogtle has taken a brand-new reactor <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7n?mblid=351eec0eee4f&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> online, the company that operates it announced yesterday.

The first built-from-scratch nuclear reactor to launch in the US in decades is supplying electricity to Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, with the capacity to power up to 500,000 homes and businesses.

The new reactor is part of a larger expansion at Vogtle, which already had two operational reactors and will add a fourth one by next spring if everything goes according to plan. But, so far, things haven’t: The new reactor went live seven years later than planned, and costs ballooned from $14 billion to nearly $35 billion.

The delays and cost overruns have led some experts to oppose new nuclear plant construction as impractical, but the public is warming up to the energy source. Recent polls show <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7o?mblid=60670cb84e41&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the highest level of support for nuclear power in a decade. It currently supplies almost 50% of US carbon-free electricity, and many experts believe it’s an important clean energy supplement to wind and solar.

Other countries are also going nuclear…two new nuclear energy projects were announced in Canada this month, while China plans to build at least six to eight new reactors a year.—SK

What would you pay for a Birken stock? <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> Birkenstock sandal in display window. <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7h?mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> John MacDougall/Getty Images
Wearing the chunkiest, ugliest shoes has always been in fashion for some of us. But now it’s clog girl summer and Birkenstock is bracing for a possible September IPO that would value <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7i?mblid=418a1f4a002e&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> the company anywhere from $8 billion to $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Birks have always been lurking. The German sandal has enjoyed several waves of popularity since it first arrived in the US in the ’60s. The shoe had a moment in the ’90s and 2000s, when mega celebrities wore them. And just like other perfectly horrendous footwear (Crocs just reported a record $1 billion of revenue for the second quarter and is valued at ~$6.7 billion), Birks are back.

Birkenstock’s revenue jumped about 29% to $1.3 billion last year.

They’re not just for Dead Heads anymore: Celebs like Kendall Jenner are rocking the sandal, and Birks even made it in a couple scenes of the new Barbie movie, which helped boost recent sales, according to Bloomberg.

Two years ago, Birkenstock was acquired in a deal that valued the company at roughly $4.9 billion by L. Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that keeps Bernard Arnault constantly trading spots with Elon Musk on the list of richest people in the world. Since the acquisition, the shoe has collabed with high-end designers like Dior and Manolo Blahnik.

Looking ahead...sources told Bloomberg that the timing and size of the IPO hasn’t been nailed down yet, but the potential plans are another sign that market debuts are making their own comeback.—MM

Stat: Who better to deliver the news that that you’re quitting your job or that you want out of your relationship than a celebrity like Flavor Flav or Brian Cox (though those ones may be NSFW)? Some people are so keen to avoid an awkward  “It’s not you, it’s me” conversation that they’re using Cameo <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7y?mblid=8fd80ed3d9ff&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> to pay famous faces to relay these messages instead: In the past three years, the pay-for-celeb-video service has received close to 5,000 requests that included “divorce” and ~2,000 with “break up,” according to the Wall Street Journal. The service has also been used at least 1,000 times to put in two weeks notice, per the WSJ.

Quote: “Delisting every asset other than bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US.”

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has never been shy about his disagreement with the SEC over whether cryptocurrencies should be viewed as securities (he says no). And in a recent interview <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7z?mblid=b61cccdada36&mbcid=32252485.3182609&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> with the Financial Times, he said the agency made it an easy choice for his company to fight for that view in court since, before suing, the agency demanded that the exchange stop trading in any crypto token besides bitcoin. The agency’s case against Coinbase is one of several cases it has pending that ask courts to weigh in on that existential question for crypto in the US.

The “Luna,” created by scientists at the University of California, Riverside, could represent major avocado innovation because it grows on a smaller tree and can be more efficiently harvested than the popular Hass variety (Luna’s great-grandmother).

OK—but how’s it taste? It’s got a different flavor than the Hass we’re used to, Luna’s co-inventor told Axios, “but it makes a wonderful bowl of guacamole.” Sold.

Do Facebook’s and Instagram’s algorithms create echo chambers that widen political divisions and erode democracy in America?

Ask 100 people and 95 might say, “Yeah, that seems logical.” The idea that social media platforms are largely responsible for political polarization has been accepted as a proven fact by elected officials, regulators, and anyone who’s been tagged in a “Denver Airport is the HQ of the Illuminati” post by their uncle. Big Tech critic Scott Galloway, an NYU professor, declared <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a48?mblid=1fcf4c990234&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> in 2019 that Facebook “intentionally drives our society apart” by “deepening users’ beliefs & magnifying outrage.”

But landmark new research complicates that narrative <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a49?mblid=9b3274599f44&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f>. Four studies released last Thursday found that while echo chambers do exist on social media, they don’t drive political polarization in the way Facebook’s critics have described.

Here’s why

Researchers arrived at this conclusion by tweaking the content US Facebook users saw from September to December 2020 and measuring their behaviors during and after the experiment.

In one study, the researchers swapped out an algorithmic feed for a reverse chronological feed for tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users, which meant changing the type of posts from what the company wanted users to see to a stream of posts the company did not put its thumb on.

The changes had no impact on political polarization, and even led users to see more untrustworthy content. Another side effect: The chronological feed also made people bored and, consequently, spend less time on the platform.

How the researchers summed it up: “These findings challenge popular narratives blaming social media echo chambers for the problems of contemporary American democracy.”

Looking ahead...independent experts caution against drawing broad conclusions from these studies, which examined behavior during just a few months. But more clarity could come soon since at least 12 more peer-reviewed papers on the topic are on the way.

This research is also not without controversy, because Meta (the object of inquiry) was a key collaborator by providing the data. The company and the researchers are already butting heads <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4a?mblid=b2b565917f12&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> around how to interpret the findings.

A 99-year-old trucking giant went bust. Yellow, among the largest trucking companies in the US, shut down <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4D?mblid=0c0a07fbdf80&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> yesterday in one of the industry’s biggest collapses in terms of jobs and revenue, the WSJ reported. The company has been teetering on the brink for years due to botched acquisitions and labor strife with the Teamsters, and not even a $700 million loan from the Trump administration during Covid could save its finances from circling the drain. Yellow employs almost 30,000 people.

A military takeover of the West African country of Niger last week has created a belt of six African countries <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4f?mblid=72df4123565b&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> coast to coast where military juntas are now in charge of the government, the NYT reported. The 3,500-mile stretch is the longest such chain on Earth.

The impacts are global: This band of military-led countries encompasses a region known as the Sahel that has leapfrogged South Asia and the Middle East as the “global epicenter of jihadist violence,” per the Times. And as a hotbed of instability and insurgency, the area has been the site of geopolitical strategery by the West and Russia for influence.

The US spent $110 million on a drone base in northern Niger for counterterrorism operations in the Sahel.

Russia, meanwhile, exerts its pull in the area through Wagner mercenaries and their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin (who is no stranger to coups). Supporters of Niger’s military takeover were seen waving Russian flags <https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a4g?mblid=f251bc387fd8&mbcid=32241274.2832384&mid=7cd3d7efcb2b5d1a6cbe0bf0931f4b2f> and chanting Vladimir Putin’s name yesterday.
